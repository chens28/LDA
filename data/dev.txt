TwoXChromosomes X My mother had me at 38, #2 at 40, and #3 at 47, and no trouble conceiving or carrying the pregnancies. She says being an older mother was always her intent. Statistically, every year you wait increases the danger of miscarriages and birth defects, but modern medicine has made anything possible! Fertility drugs and counseling help a lot of older women. I say wait as long as you want.
TwoXChromosomes X My boyfriend would like me to get one. Since we are mostly exclusive and very selective/careful about who we are 'exposed to' (for lack of a better term) STDs are not really a worry, and as I am 19 and in college, I definitely don't want to get pregnant. Is it a good idea?
TwoXChromosomes X I am a man and I have trouble with orgasm sometimes. What helps for me is to just do what feels good, in any way it feels good. Orgasm isn't everything, and I think that men especially tend to have orgasm-focused sex and want to do that for women, and as a result women feel pressured to orgasm a lot also (or fake it). It's not wrong to want to orgasm more, but don't get too stuck on it that it tinges the whole experience.  On your clit: deep, deep breaths. Relax as much as possible. Slow stimulation, _without_ the immediate goal of getting to orgasm. touch other areas of the vulva, and have him touch other areas, veeeerrrry subtly. Meditate on the sacredness of him having his hands here, in a place that people normally wouldn't even see. Don't think about having an orgasm... just feeeeeel it out and notice how you feel, and swim in it. :-)  There's unfortunately no guarantee of anything. But by opening up your mind about what sex consists of and trying out new ways of thinking and framing the experience, not getting stuck on one thing, you can have the time of your life. Perhaps that's why the drinking/smoking seems to help. Just let go of your expectations and do what feels good in any way it feels good. You'll have plenty of time afterward to break it all down and reassess what you want.
TwoXChromosomes X Great advice! I am a bit worried about the hormonal shifts involved with Mirena, but i also hear there are similar problems with the copper IUD, such as rejection from the uterus and implantation into the uterine wall*yikes!.     I have had kids, so perhaps that will help make the procedure easier but i haven't had terribly periods really. When i first started my periods, they were very heavy but rarely intensely crampy.    
TwoXChromosomes X There are other barriers out there besides condoms; [diaphragms]( -topics/birth-control/diaphragm-4244.htm) and [cervical caps]( -topics/birth-control/cervical-cap-20487.htm) come to mind. They may not be as effective as condoms, but it gives you options.  Here's a [chart]( ) comparing different birth control methods. 
TwoXChromosomes X How bad has the cramping been for you? For the week I had the Mirena in, I had terrible cramping that didn't even respond well to the Vicodin they prescribed me, but that could have been my body rejecting to the hormones. From what I understand, the one big downside to the copper IUD is that you get longer, heavier periods. Has that been an issue you've had to deal with? At this point, I feel pretty open to anything that doesn't affect my libido/brain even if it has other side effects.
TwoXChromosomes X Perhaps your body has bad reactions to the active ingredient of most hormonal birth controls? I'm not a doctor, so it's possible there is something out there, but have you thought of say, the copper IUD? It doesn't rely on anything hormonal, but would still make you pretty infertile for a few years. 
TwoXChromosomes X Tubal ligation can be reversed.  Reversal isn't always effective, and the reversal surgery is more serious than the tubal ligation, but there is that.  You can also have eggs harvested, inseminated, and implanted.  All of these options make having your own biological child, carried to term in your own body after tubal ligation may be very expensive, and it's not a guarantee, but is not out of the realm of possibility.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never heard of vaginismus before. According to Google, "Vaginismus is an involuntary spasm of the muscles surrounding the vagina. The spasms close the vagina. Symptoms: Vaginal penetration during sex is difficult or impossible"  For you, does this mean you actually can't have sex at all, or just that it's difficult/painful?
TwoXChromosomes X My big problem with your write-up is that you essentially advise women NOT to go to a doctor for a bladder infection.  This is 100% bad advice, as a bladder infection can VERY quickly worsen, move up to your kidneys, and KILL YOU.  While drinking LOTS of water and cranberry juice, being careful about staying clean, peeing after sex (one point you missed that is VERY important), and maintaining the pH balance in your vagina may help prevent an infection, they should not be your only form of TREATING an infection.  You should **always** drink a lot of water, wipe from front to back, and keep an eye out for your wellbeing.  I will personally up my water and cranberry juice intake if I've done something "risky" recently (not peeing after sex and sleeping through the night) to hopefully prevent any bacteria from sticking and multiplying, but the moment I experience urgency to urinate or pain or burning, I go to Urgent Care as soon as humanly possible.  
TwoXChromosomes X I got nothing but the suggestion to take 800mg of ibuprofen - I also wasn't on my period when my doctor inserted it, and it was pretty uncomfortable, but it definitely wasn't unbearable. I'm sure you'll be fine, considering you'll be on your period AND you're taking misoprosol! Good luck to you - I hope the IUD works well for you. Unfortunately, I had to have mine removed because it came out of place. :(  My vote for the name is: Petey.  I don't know why. First name that came to me.
TwoXChromosomes X Right now, we can all at least agree that if a baby can live outside of the mother, it is much too late to abort. While there is an issue with defining a human life, it isn't going to be defined as a four-week old zygote unless abortion becomes illegal again. I think in this discussion, it doesn't matter so much what the debate of human life is, as what the OP considers to be human life. It is more respectful to her if we don't equate abortion with something heartless like tossing out the trash.
TwoXChromosomes X I was prescribed it, but then got my period ahead of schedule, changed my appointment on 2 hours notice, and the misoprosol didn't have time to take effect in the intervening time before my appointment.  I also forgot to take any sort of painkillers.  So I had possibly the most painful insertion ever, at age 19, with a completely undilated inverted (and kinked) cervix.   Word to the wise:  take the misoprosol and some advils before your appointment.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been on Yasmin for ~2.5 years and initially went on it due to painful periods.  I take 3 packs continuously at a time, so that I have a period one time per ~10 weeks.  My periods are a lot lighter and shorter now and the pain tends to be a one day thing instead of a three day thing; it doesn't prevent me from functioning pretty regularly anymore.  That said (and this is something I've noticed more recently), I seem to become a total moody bitch during that week, whereas I didn't before, so it's a tradeoff there.
TwoXChromosomes X Dove frequently has coupons! Check their site, and stock up on a good sale!
TwoXChromosomes X Do you ever regret it. Well maybe not regret it, but wish you could have had the baby? I would have loved to have a baby, I've always wanted to be a mother, I just think it would have been irresponsible and unfair to the child to bring him/her into the world and grow up scraping change for food.
TwoXChromosomes X I am sorry for your trouble, I have always had a really tight vagina (couldn't get a tampon in w/o lube for a while) but have no problem during sex when using lube or when I am naturally wet. Then again, I don't even recall being told sex was supposed to be painful. I hope it is just a matter of physical issues rather than psychological. 
TwoXChromosomes X My periods used to last about 4 days, and were rather light. Immediately following insertion I had the second worst period of my life (the first one being post-abortion). It wasn't too bad; ibuprofen worked fine in large doses.  After that, my periods have been 5-7 days with the "average" amount of flow. I cramped for the first two, but not after that (I was never one to cramp in the first place).   I've had no adverse effects whatsoever. I've had it over a year now. My only issues were that my current boyfriend is larger than most, and we like things a bit rough. We had to stick to shallow positions for 2-3 months, or else I'd either be pretty sore or bleeding a bit or both. He could go deep if he wasn't too enthusiastic about it.   Other than that, the ParaGard has been great. I get it checked regularly. My boyfriend always makes sure it's in place and the string is the same length (my fingers are too short :-P). I highly recommend it!!!  Edit: Core-strengthening exercises can help reduce cramping in *some* women. The only times I ever had even the slightest cramps were when I wasn't in one sport or another. 
TwoXChromosomes X Breasts swollen and tender mostly.  I just had a gut feeling, something felt different in my body.  I took a test before I even missed my period and it was positive.  That was with the first one.  The next two I pretty much knew I was preggers as soon as we were done having sex. :)  Not joking at all either.  
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks for the advice!! I have always kind of wanted a "natural" birth, preferably in a birthing tub and a midwife (if I don't have any complicating factors, of course.)  Who knows, might still happen that way. ;)
TwoXChromosomes X I've been thinking about a copper IUD- hormonal birth control has not worked out well for me and I'm absolutely awful at remembering- but I'm worried that I won't be able to have one because I've never had kids. Is that a deal breaker? I'm not planning on having kids for 10+ years, if at all.  
TwoXChromosomes X In 2007 (I think) they re-evaluated the list of contraindications for ParaGard (the copper IUD) and removed the one for nulliparous women. I was told by my GYN that they would not allow women who have never had children to get one because there is an 8% expulsion risk, which is significantly higher than with women who have had children. However, that's changed - they decided that if you're willing to accept the risk so are they, and the label was changed to allow insertion for nulliparous women. AFAIK that contraindication is still listed for Mirena because the device is larger than the ParaGard, but I have heard of women without children getting it from a willing GYN.   So in short, you shouldn't have a problem getting the ParaGard. :)
TwoXChromosomes X The idea of having a foreign object in my body for 5+ years makes me really uncomfortable. I'm worried about it poking my uterus and the pain of the insertion process. Maybe after I have kids I'll look into it again. Right now though, Nuvaring is just fine. 
TwoXChromosomes X She needs to try to calm down (which can be really hard in this situation, I know) - stressing out about her period is only going to make it come later.  I've delayed my period a week or more stressing out about this kind of stuff.  As has been mentioned, lots of other things can also mess with it.  If she's gone on vacation or has moved recently or something like that, that can delay it too.  I'd probably give it another week, try another OTC pregnancy test, and then go in to planned parenthood or whatnot if there still was no sign of a period coming.
TwoXChromosomes X That's the thing though. I've been on: Tricyclin, Tricyclin Lo, Alesse, Aviane, and Yasmin; and i've had problems with all of them. I don't want to go off birth control completely and just use condoms (although i'm pretty sure i started gaining weight when on birth control) but i'm not 100% sure what to do yet. Thanks for some input though!
TwoXChromosomes X You're right, it is a theoretical risk, considering it's still something sitting in your vagoo, but it's not like it's throwing off the balance of moisture and all that crap that tampons do.  Yay for cups!
TwoXChromosomes X You know, she's on contraception for a reason....she doesn't want to be pregnant.   Plus your info is wrong. Plan B isn't an abortion, it (at most) prevents implantation which is where most people mark conception. It just prevents conception.
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with you; however, if you view all abortion as murder, then it's not the baby's fault it was conceived through rape.  As you say, though, this scenario is extremely rare, rape/incest abortions account for less than 1.5% of all abortions.
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you so much. I normally clot during my period, but is it normal to clot 4 days early with brown discharge? Especially membrane-ish tissue?
TwoXChromosomes X Like you said it's pointless regarding of when he pulls out, there's still a chance of pregnancy no matter when he pulls out if it's unprotected sex.  If you're taking the birth control properly it'd be more enjoyable for you both if you just had sex normally, hence why I don't really see the point in this circumstance, and if you are that worried about getting pregnancy you may as well use a condom.

TwoXChromosomes X Talk to whoever's giving you birth control-- some of them are better about relieving acne than others.  You may get better results with one over another.  If you have worse symptoms when taking the sugar pills, you might want to try one of the formulations that don't have as many periods.
TwoXChromosomes X That's pretty irresponsible. Just sayin'.  Birth control is free. If you are using the 'pull out' method, you are actively trying to get pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're referring to masturbating, it is. It would most likley be considered "lewd and lacivious conduct", and could even have "indecent exposure" tagged on there.
TwoXChromosomes X I use a Diva cup and love the fact that it's basically zero waste, but I have one day every month where I can't stop the leaks so I'm looking to buy some cloth pads for back-up.  I've had mine for about a year and a half now and estimate a savings of about 400 tampons during that time.  I don't think this is any more gross that using cloth diapers for a baby which seems to be all the rage these days.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;If the two people involved are both fine with it, then it isn't harassment.   Not by my manager-level sexual harassment training, unless the conversation occurs between the two people, both of whom are fine with it, and no one else hears it. If someone else overhears it and takes offense or is made to feel uncomfortable, a "hostile workplace" has been created.
TwoXChromosomes X So true!  Every pelvic exam I've ever had from an NP (and I've seen quite a few) has been as good as it gets; professional but warm and friendly, and super gentle and comfortable.  GPs and gynos,  not so much.
TwoXChromosomes X No. I am not totally paranoid. I consider my level of precaution to be a matter of taking my personal health and safety seriously.   I make every partner get an STD test before we sleep together. At this point I want to be there when they get test results too (I had one partner lie to me about doing it (they were clear thank goodness)).   If someone isn't willing to get STD tested with me then I'm not willing to have sex with them. 
TwoXChromosomes X There are several STDs that condoms don't always protect you from. HPV and herpes are a good examples of this - contagious matter/outbreaks are not always confined to areas covered by condoms.   That being said, condom use is not something I would ever discourage. Some protection is better than none, and there are so many other STDs that condoms effectively protect against that are more dangerous than HPV or herpes. 
TwoXChromosomes X As someone in the medical field, an STD test for a new boyfriend, while not really unreasonable, is a little overboard, especially if you are using condoms.   Herpes and genital warts are only detectable if there are physical symptoms (open sores, warts), so that in itself is a no-brainer. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are always testable (for some reason, many hospitals and clinics still use the swab method...painful), but these are completely preventable with condoms and easily treated. HPV strains currently do not have verifiable tests for males. The HIV virus, well, everyone should get tested for this once a year, and most physicians do this during a yearly physical.   So, in my opinion, if you are using condoms 100% and there are no obvious concerns, an STD testing shouldn't really be the first thing on your mind. It certainly doesn't hurt, however. 
TwoXChromosomes X HPV can go through condoms, and you can get some disseases like herpies even using a condom because they are like sores on your genitals  and sex involves gential contact.   As for HIV... there could be a hole in the condom - unlikely but still risky because HIV is so often deadly
TwoXChromosomes X The concern for IUDs increasing the chance of pelvic inflammatory disease, caused by STDs entering the uterus, is really only a problem at insertion.  That is, if you have an STD at the time the IUD is inserted, it could potentially enter the uterus and cause issues.  However, if you already have an IUD and then contract an STD, you are not at higher risk for PID than if you did not have an IUD.   source: -pid.htm
TwoXChromosomes X So are you bisexual, transsexual, a troll, or a combination of the three? Cause you were [looking for a girl]( _women_of_reddit_how_do_you_get_a_girl_to_like/) here and you seem to be using "he" to describe yourself [here.]( _anyone_else_feel_lonely_even_though_hes/) And you're a straight person with a penis [here]( _skip_bj_scenes_when_watching_porn/c0cvgv3) but macking on waifish boys [here]( _other_girl_here_like_waifish_boys/) and preferring them uncircumcised [here]( _advice_circumcision/c0kyi0u).   Or are you just a waifish guy with an uncircumcised, small penis and looking for women to tell you they like that?
TwoXChromosomes X I tried an all natural tampon from the co-op, it was possibly the most horrific experience with a tampon ever.  The cardboard applicator scratched me and once it was in a little bit later in the day I could feel it, it was falling out. Went to the bathroom, took it out, never tried those again. Perhaps it was the brand I used, but most tampons are bleached, which can create harmful byproducts, so that's why I tried switching. Now I'm going to start using the cup instead. 
TwoXChromosomes X I swear Marijuana was MADE for relieving menstrual pain. It helps me every month.   I gets rid of the 'incapacitated by pain' feeling and helps you to focus on what you need to do that day.
TwoXChromosomes X I started experiencing breakthrough bleeding when I was on a low-dose birth control pill, after at least two years of being on it.  After a couple months of the same thing, I went back to my gyn and was prescribed a different birth control pill, in a higher dose.  Breakthrough bleeding was gone!  If it's a problem that continues past this one cycle, I'd see your gyn.  
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, there is that. The learning curve can take a while.   As far as I know, the only way to tell if you have it in correctly is to try to twist it. If you can twist it easily, and it feels as though it isn't folded anymore, then it's properly inserted, and won't leak.  In my case, once I learned to put it in correctly, I didn't have any problems at all until I got my IUD. Then my flow dramatically increased, and I had to pay close attention to how long I went between emptying it. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had both the mooncup and the divacup.  My divacup (bought about a decade ago) was dark orange and my mooncup (bought about 2 years ago) is clear.  The clear gets more stained, over time.  But, I really don't find that bothersome.  I didn't notice much of a difference between the two.   Maybe the mooncup is a bit more flexible, but I don't have a more recent divacup.    My favorite place to change out (or put in) the cup is in the shower.  I like it being slightly wet when I put it in (it slips in more easily).  And, it's really easy to take it out, rinse it with a little soap, and put it back in.    If I have to empty it in a public place, then I usually just pull it out, dump it, and put it right back in.  I prefer it not being dry when I put it in---so, wiping it down with toilet paper wouldn't work best for me.  And, I'm not motivated enough to bring a bottle of water into a bathroom stall.  I've never really had leaking issues, but like "GeekyMumma" says: you just need to make sure that it fully unfolds inside and there is a good seal.  Just slip your finger around to make sure it's unfolded.  Then, gently tug the end to make sure there is a tight seal.  When I first started using them, I'd check carefully.  Now, however, I just know when it's in right.  You shouldn't need to buy a new cup for a long time, as long as you care for it by cleaning it well.  You need a new cup if there are any cracks or tear in the rubber of the cup.  Two important hints.  First, figure out how long of a stem you want and cut off the end.  Don't be afraid to keep the stem a little longer until you get used to it; then, after a few periods, cut it a little shorter.  The main point is, if the stem is too long, it can be quite uncomfortable hanging outside of you.  Second, (and, I've said this a few times before), make sure that you don't ever just tug on the stem to yank the cup out; always, always be sure to break the seal first---squeeze the cup a little (or spin it around) to break the seal, then pull on the stem to take it out.  Enjoy the savings, the lack of risk of TSS, and the lack of filling up the landfills!
TwoXChromosomes X For my first (and only) Depo shot I had about three weeks without any bleeding scattered amongst endless days of bleeding. Not uncommon, at least according to my OBGYN.
TwoXChromosomes X One time I screwed up my birth control and had my period like that for a month straight.  I would get it checked out when possible, but don't get too worried about it yet. The shot might have just really messed with her hormones.  
TwoXChromosomes X You'll be very excited when it arrives.  Boil it up and give it a try!  In that first try, it's very likely to feel uncomfortable and foreign.  Don't despair!  That's because it's something new and you're not actually on your cycle yet.  Don't trim the stem now!  I did that, and now mine is too short.  The cup sits differently when you're actually on your cycle.  Your cervix moves down and your vagina is less dry.  I find mine somewhat uncomfortable when I'm dry, but don't even feel it when I'm on my cycle.
TwoXChromosomes X Throwing my ZOMGITSAWESOME out there with the rest of them.  It may be a bit uncomfortable at first, and I'll admit that the first few times it didn't sit properly (there were a few my cup runneth over moments). Once you get the hang of it - seriously, 4 tries and you're golden - you'll never go back.  I love my menstrual cup. Don't get discouraged if it's uncomfortable at first, or if it doesn't sit right. Just try different folds. I'm not nervous about my body, so the first few times I inserted it, I felt around up there to make sure that the cup had opened up from the fold. Once I knew what it felt like on a good insertion, it was smooth sailing.  You can trim the stem once you figure out how it's going to sit and if it's going to be uncomfortable. I cut the whole thing off, but your mileage may vary. I just reach up and grab the base of the cup to remove it, rather than fiddle with breaking the suction with the stem.  
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, since I was 12 I've had the most horrid cramps and other symptoms (started periods at 9). When I was 15 I noticed that smoking during my period made me feel *way* better. 
TwoXChromosomes X I recently went into my pharmacist to talk about this (I take Yasmin) - this is what she said: studies show that it's okay for 6 - 8 months at least (it might be okay longer); breakthrough bleeding is normal if you take it for too long, it doesn't indicate reduced effectiveness; if you do get significant breakthrough bleeding after being on it for months, you can take your week off (or however long) then; it's okay to have a shorter sugar-pill week (4 days or so instead of the standard 7).  In the past I took my pill continuously for 9 weeks and then took the sugar pills week 10.  More recently, I just took my pill for ~4 months straight and eventually my body wouldn't have it anymore; I had breakthrough bleeding that was basically like a light period for probably 3-4 days before I decided to just start my off week (since I was getting all the effects of being hormonal anyways).  I only took 3 or 4 days off of my pill, though, instead of the week.  It was by far the heaviest period I've had in a long time, so there is that to consider if you are looking to take it continuously, but it wasn't too bad.
TwoXChromosomes X The hormone levels are highest in week 3. Dropping down to week 1 can cause spotting/menstruation and make the pill less effective. Your doc can give you a prescription for a mono-phasic pack that matches the hormone levels of week 3 to skip a full cycle.
TwoXChromosomes X Ah.  I frequently have sex while on my period so it would be incredibly wasteful for me to use puppy pads.  As for the bloody cloths laying around issue, I've never found them to be stinky. 
TwoXChromosomes X I never had these problems on the pill, they sound awful.  I think I've heard that nuvaring has fewer side effects with the same effectiveness.    I'd love to have an IUD but can't get one - there have been some good xx threads on them lately, check them out before you write that off.
TwoXChromosomes X If you don't have a heating pad, take a clean sock and fill it with uncooked rice.Then tie up the end and throw that sucker in the microwave for a minute or so.    Instant heating pad! 
TwoXChromosomes X Over the course of 1 year, the withdrawal method is 96% effective.  Basically it's better than nothing, but you wouldn't fly in a plane if it had a 4% chance to crash either.  This statistic, like other birth control statistics, presumes that the method is being practiced properly.  
TwoXChromosomes X I think they read it right... I wouldn't fly several times a week for a year if I knew that there was a 4% chance I'd crash at some point that year ;)  And it's per 100 women using the method perfectly - typical use tends to have much higher failure rates.
TwoXChromosomes X You're probably spreading HPV (genital warts).  There's no test for asymptomatic men, but they obviously can transmit it.  The kind that doesn't give bumps, and so goes unnoticed, is more likely to give [cervical cancer]( -conditions/hpv-genital-warts/cervical-cancer-hpv-what-women-girls-should-know).  Condoms aren't going to totally prevent spreading HPV but will probably help.  I got HPV and I'm not at all promiscuous, but my S.O. did have sex with one other person during a 6 month break, so we guess he got it from her.  The colposcopy and the pap smears are annoying and expensive and the stress of thinking I might get cervical cancer just isn't worth it.  Be careful!
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think that I've ever met anyone as quick as I am, but I usually climax within a couple minutes when I'm by myself.  Every once in a while, though, I plan to have much longer sessions with myself---sometimes I plan a little date with myself and I light candles, have a bath, and then play around.   When I'm with my partner, it depends on our priorities for the particular session---sometimes I like to hold back for a bit and other times I like to climax a few times throughout the session.   When I'm with a new sex partner, I rarely climax---it's difficult for me to let down the barriers enough.  Sometimes (e.g., when I'm particularly stressed), I have a very difficult time climaxing (alone or with my partner).  So, killertofuuuuu, what about you?  Let's compare notes.
TwoXChromosomes X Possibly on the minera IUD which is a hormonal one, not the copper IUD. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on my first IUD period (ParaGard, non-hormonal) and it really hasn't been that bad. My periods on the NuvaRing were worse (more cramping, bleeding, and migraines). I have my checkup next Thursday, but so far I'm loving it.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, I have never been pregnant. I live in Ohio and had one inserted just a few weeks ago.    My doctor told me that abstaining from nulliparous insertions was an 'old school' way of doing things.    They say the pain is slightly more for women who have not had a pregnancy- and while it was fairly uncomfortable I would certainly recommend it despite that one drawback (that only lasts for about 2-5 minutes, if that).
TwoXChromosomes X No I'm serious, I'm in Canada.  We are entitled to something like 17 weeks maternity leave, employment insurance covers about 55% of your income and many employer benefit plans include an additional allowance.  Your employer is required to hold your job for when you return and your leave cannot be counted against you in determining promotions or evaluating performance.    For an employer that could mean paying to train an employee who may only work 6 months before taking leave, during which you will have benefit obligations and you cannot hire a permanent replacement.  There is also the chance that they won't come back after leave, or if they do they will require additional accommodation for breastfeeding/pumping/childcare and may be less reliable because they have to take care of the child.  Not saying I agree with that, but that was the professor's point.
TwoXChromosomes X I find it very sad, because the writer of the article is seemingly enjoying her sex life and the novel ways of intimately bonding with her partner, but a nameless outside pressure and expectation seems to be sabotaging that enjoyment.    It is true that intercourse is considered the pinnacle in our culture, almost to the point where oral sex and manual sex are not even considered "sex" at all.  When was the last time you heard someone say "I had sex with him for the first time yesterday" and then proceed to tell you about the mind-blowing cunnilingus, tittyfucking, and blowjob that went down?  No, we usually all assume sex means penis in vagina.  I don't know if it is generational; my mother always tells me that people my age have a "Clintonian view" of sex.  Definitely food for thought.  I had posted [something slightly related]( _orgasm_and_penetrative_sex/), at least in sentiment, in TwoX awhile ago.     
TwoXChromosomes X I don't know about NuvaRing. I'm on a seasonal pill that requires I only have a period every three months and I would maybe try that instead of messing around with your NuvaRing.   Also if it helps, while on these pills, I did skip a period because I was working at a Summer Camp, and had no difficulties.
TwoXChromosomes X I can't remember my first experience as it's been a long while. But it did take me about 3-4 cycles to get it right, in terms of placement, no leaks, checking the seal was correct etc.   I would give it another go. It's worth it once you've got the hang of it.   I was told by other more experienced users than I when I got mine a small squeeze and twist should break the seal enough to then be able to pull it out no problems. 
TwoXChromosomes X This completely matches my own experience.   "Bear down" a little until you can grip the stem, then pull it a little until you are able to pinch the cup. This releases the suction which is *very important*.  It did take me a couple of days to get used to removing and inserting it. The first time I was in complete despair! But I hung in there and now it's so easy -- I would never ever go back. Hang in there please!
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm, when I was on a combined pill my appetite was slightly higher than normal, but very constant. I put on 7lb in the first few months on it then stayed the same weight for a very long time.  When I was on the progesterone only pill I just wanted to eat ALL the time, it's all I could think about.  Luckily I'm off hormones altogether now and back to my natural appetite - which is fairly small most of the time.
TwoXChromosomes X This was confusing to me too- basically, the pap is in two parts. The first is general. That came back negative (all fine and clear). However, the HPV test that you mention did come back positive, which was why I had to go back in. A few years back, I had Gardasil, so that ruled out high-risk strains. When I went back today, they didn't find anything, meaning it was most likely a fluke OR it's nothing serious (ie not pre-cancerous).
TwoXChromosomes X They aren't intended to be on the front lines of period flow. Panty liners are good for light spotting between periods, tampon back-up, between-period vaginal secretions, and post-sex semen leakage.  These smaller quantities of fluids would tend to flow down toward the panty liner instead of back towards your ass. Once they hit the liner they'd be wicked away into the cotton. In fact, the liner would likely decrease the total quantity of moisture flowing out the side of your asscrack.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Most doctors won't request the test for HPV unless the pap itself comes back abnormal though, since just the presence of HPV without symptoms can screw you over in terms of insurance coverage    That is probably why I was confused. Everyone I know who's had further HPV testing or exams has had an abnormal pap.
TwoXChromosomes X I completely understand and am totally in the same boat. I have 2 different type of orgasms, and sometimes it's more of a hassle when I get the "spasm orgasm" with my man because I feel like "OMG you must stop or I am going to burst...and not in a good way." But just because I am not getting the spasm orgasm, doesn't make the other orgasm and less great. It's this intense feelings that makes me want to yell on top of my lungs "OMG I LOVE YOU...GIVE ME MORE AND NEVER STOP!" I'm not faking them, just different things that my my body go crazy. 
TwoXChromosomes X On the issue of being "ready" for kids... I agree that I never would have been "ready". At some point, we decided to stop trying ~not~ to get pregnant. We didn't decide to have a baby, but we decided we didn't need to actively prevent pregnancy. It was a trick... but it worked.     I've heard many horror stories of women who were "ready" but then couldn't get pregnany... until they stopped trying :)
TwoXChromosomes X Paragard doesn't help with irregular periods, but Mirena, since there is some hormones in it, will help.  Basically, the Mirena is the same as the Paragard, but takes off the edge of crampy, heavy, irregular periods. And, as I said above, it's also physically larger than the Paragard.
TwoXChromosomes X First off, I am fully supportive of unattended births.  :)  Second, I often do "on call" support and "a la carte" care for people who want unattended births, but want some backup just in case there are questions or they want help at the labor/birth/postpartum.  I think that it varies re: non-nurse midwives.  Certainly there are some that are more flexible than others.  I think that most of us support a woman's right to choose the type of care she wants and somehow (sigh) has a deeper connection to the outcome of her birth than we do.  I trust that women, with the right information, can make their own decisions.  part of what has ruined obstetrics (and even nurse-midwifery) is the homogenization of care.  Paternalistic thinking results in believing that every woman needs to be saved from herself and can't possibly understand the rocket science that is pregnancy and birth.  I am flexible with clients because we are all different.  I provide them with information and resources, and sometimes skills, but there is no reason why I have to pull out all the guns on every client.
TwoXChromosomes X I provide on-call support and per-visit care for couples planning unattended births.  I live in Oregon, though, and I will say the atmosphere here re UC birth is much different than WA.
TwoXChromosomes X i had hyperemesis. i threw up the entire pregnancy. between five and twenty times a day. later on in like the end of the third trimester i would throw up once or twice a day. but still feel nauseas all day.   but. it was worth it, and i'm trying for it again. crazy, i know. 
TwoXChromosomes X There is absolutely NO WAY it can slip out...tampons have more of a danger of slipping out than a cup. You fold it to put it in, and then it unfolds once it's inside, creating a small amount suction over your cervix which holds it.  When it's time to take it out, you take a finger, break the seal and gently pull it out.  With practice, no mess!
TwoXChromosomes X Basically it is a little medical grade sillicon cup.    You fold it in half and insert it. It can be awkward at first, but you become a pro pretty quickly.    Generally I insert then I stand and do a few hula-hoop like motions and use my fingers to make sure it has 'opened' and is situated properly.    It's awesome.     Here is the [DivaCup website]( )    You empty it every 10-12 hours. For me I empty it in the morning, when I get home from work, and again when I shower.     Its enviromentally intelligent as well!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 6' and my Femmecup is quite comfortable.  I had trouble with the Diva cup because I'm tilted forward, and couldn't get a good enough grip to break the seal.  The Femmecup is squishier and has bigger holes.  (The big holes mean they're less likely to clog, so the seal is easier to break)
TwoXChromosomes X Oh man...never go with the creams. They don't treat the er.....deeper part of the problem. I don't know what they are called, but use the "pills" that you push up your lady parts. They are my over the counter life savers! I just had a yeast infection, and what you have sounds like one to me. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I felt I could safely leave that caveat unsaid.    Please tell this to the multiple partners who've tried to convince me I'm defective for not experiencing joyous multiple orgasms at the mere thought of anal penetration... :P  There is seriously still a lot of expectation among (some) men that anal sex is a given in a sexual relationship, the way vaginal and oral tend to be.  I love love love porn, but I think this is one area where the lack of alternate sources of information on sex is really doing people a disservice.
TwoXChromosomes X [From the CDC]( -2002TG.htm) If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule is recommended, administered vaginally once daily for 2 weeks. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70%.  (again, compare this with clindamycin and flagyl, which are effective at around 66%) -glabrata-vaginitis-clinical-aspects-and-susceptibility-to-antifungal-agents.html   *If symptoms persist, treatment with flucytosine or topical boric acid should then be used.* 'm not saying it's the only choice for all women, but it's cost effective, over the counter and works for candida and most types of bacterial vaginosis.  As someone who has suffered from BV chronically due to a semen sensitivity I have gone through numerous rx of Flagyl only to mess up my ladybits and end up with bacteria that is resistent to Flagyl - and yeast infections because of the Flagyl.  An easy solution to the issue is to look at things that will balance the pH of the vagina (boric acid, garlic) that will not typically send it into another problem (exchanging yeast for BV or vice versa).  When we target BACTERIA or CANDIDA specifically, we are often trading one issue for another.  it's not always the case, but dammit, when you live in a recurrent cycle of BV this is a huge problem.  :(  Doing boric acid twice a week after ovulation (because the pH of my vagina shifts radically after ovulation, esp right before menses) has gotten me off of the Flagyl cycle and has helped tremendously.    The suggestion for this treatment came directly from my MD.  As many holistic friends as I have being a midwife, I trust her implicitly and her suggestions proved to be right on. 
TwoXChromosomes X So...are you cured.  I have been struggling with this same issue since November.  I've taken 2 doses of diflucan, and nothing.  Still burning.  So I was wondering if your infection ever cleared up?  Did you try any of the home remedies (probiotic pills, boric acid, etc?).  I'm looking for some hope here.  And I also hope you are feeling better. :)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; "What do you mean 'baby'?" I have sometimes been asked. This is a rhetorical question, because the supporters of taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand, who ask it, know exactly what the word means.  Of course we know what a baby is.  It's an extremely young child.  A fetus isn't a baby, any more than a zygote is an embryo or an embryo a fetus.  Should we also call middle aged people senior citizens?  Senior Citizens "still living corpses"?  Sure, mothers might refer to their fetuses as being "my baby", but they're going to do that until they die, and no one would consider a grown human a baby (except for his mother).
TwoXChromosomes X I just went through this last spring. I had two consecutive abnormal paps, and then was sent for a colposcopy. The gynecologist was fairly sure I had moderate dysplasia, but when the results came back, it was severe. So, I went for a LEEP. (Which is a procedure where they excise the cells with a wire loop heated electrically) In October, I went for followup, and everything looks great.   The good news is, thanks to colposcopy, we have a fantastic chance to prevent cancer. It was scary, but now I am so thankful things are under control. I was so surprised because I have always had normal paps (for the last 20 years) and suddenly the result is severe dysplasia. I cannot urge women enough to always get your paps - you never can be sure what will happen.
TwoXChromosomes X O.k I admit I haven't read through everything here, but am a Mum.   But my question to you all, especially those who seems opposed to it happening in public is this. How many of you don't eat in public and only eat in private, behind closed doors where no one else can see you?  If you don't why should a baby? While I couldn't breast feed my son and he was bottle fed.  Babies are hungry when they are hungry not when it's convenient for you.  If done right and done discreetly you shouldn't see any more breast than you do in a low cut top.   So yeah I'm all for it.  In fact here in NZ we have a breastfeeding campaign which has posters up at bus stops and the likes showing woman breastfeeding in public.   
TwoXChromosomes X Peeing immediately after sex totally worked for me. After I started doing that I never got another UTI. Perhaps you are waiting too long after sex to pee? Definitely talk to a doctor though to make sure you don't develop a kidney infection or anything more serious. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you develop a kidney infection, you'll know. The pain associated with UTI's is multiplied 50 times and is debilitating. *Always* pee after sex!
TwoXChromosomes X Cramps suck. I can take punches to the face, slips, spills, sprained ankles, burns, tattoos... but cramps have put me in bed at times, curled in a big ball of moans and pain. Sometimes it's just an ache, but it can get really bad, and it feels like my insides are trying to break free. I use to miss a day of school back when I was a teenager, now I just have to suck it up and take a bunch of advil at work. It's pretty distracting though, and really hard to ignore. They've made me sick to my stomach in the past, and sometimes I find it hard to eat.  Ha, I make cramps sound like some sort of horrible curse. They really aren't *that* bad, but they do suck, and can be completely inconvenient, but there's a lot of ways to relieve them.
TwoXChromosomes X My period cramps are dull, radiating pain in my abdomen. They're never that severe on their own, but I also tend to get serious gut cramps during my period. Those cramps are pretty awful.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine range from a dull ache to feeling like someone is grabbing my uterus, squeezing really hard, and twisting.  My worst have had me writhing on my bed in pain.  Fortunately they're not usually that bad.    The worst is the pain/icky feeling generalizes to my whole abdomen.  I can rarely eat much of anything the first day of my period.
TwoXChromosomes X For me it feels like intense, acute lower back pain. Sometimes it hurts so much that I can't lay down, sit down, or stand up without wanting to cry. Of course, a lot of those times I'm already crying because my hormones get so out of whack. If I'm fortunate, I'll have cannabis around - that always helps so much!
TwoXChromosomes X My entire uterus feels like one giant, heavy black bruise.  Any movement causes strong but dull pain, and even if I'm perfectly still I can feel slow rhythmic cramps that tighten things up and ache, like someone massaging a really bad bruise.  I also tend to get constipated during the first couple days, and straining to poo makes the uterus pain 10x worse.
TwoXChromosomes X I did it many times while on microgestin.  My OB/GYN actually recommended doing it when i asked her for the 'seasonique' pill.  She told me it's no different from the one I was taking except they just leave out the placebo pills and give you three packs at a time.
TwoXChromosomes X I tried this the week of my wedding/honeymoon. I ended up somehow having my period for the entire two weeks of my honeymoon. So my attempt at eliminating my period ended up doubling it. I guess I've never been very good at math :P
TwoXChromosomes X Feels like... your uterus is contracting, I guess. Sore, achey, somewhat the sensation of pulling, tension... I don't know, it's hard to describe. Mostly it feels like ouch and a good reason to be cranky.  I also get lower back aches when I'm on the rag. Those are way worse than the actual sensation coming from my uterus.
TwoXChromosomes X If you want something that will maintain its lubi-ness, you should stay away from water based lubes (like KY and Astroglide) and try a silicone-based lube.  The only catch is that you have to keep it off of any silicone toys.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Your chances of expelling a second iud are much lower than the chances of expelling the first.  I was curious why this would be, so I looked around a bit and found this [here]( +safe+effective+underused.htm), which seems to indicate the opposite:  *"Between two percent and 10 percent of users spontaneously expel their IUD within the first year. Expulsion rates are highest in the first three months after insertion, and women younger than 20 years of age have the highest expulsion rates. A woman who has expelled an IUD has a 30 percent chance of subsequent expulsion."*  And I couldn't find any source that told me the rate for second expulsion was lower.  So I'm wondering if your doctor told you the rate was less, or where you read that.
TwoXChromosomes X The information did come from my doctor.  She actually told me when she inserted the second one that it was next to impossible that I would expel it.  I went to a nurse practitioner for the third one, the one that I still have.  She said that the expulsion rates go down with the second, as well.  She actually talked me into the third one, I was ready to switch to implants.  She had known of a couple of previous cases in which only the third one took.  She was right in my case.
TwoXChromosomes X My understanding of why they recommend Mirena for people who have already given birth is twofold: that insertion is easier, and because there are risks that could result in the inability to have more children. That's what my gyno told me; in fact, she wouldn't insert mine since I haven't given birth, and sent me to someone else.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't know, I never had a doctor perform any kind of pelvic exam on me until I was around 15. I had a history of UTIs as well as a broken pelvic bone around 8 years old. Never once did any doctor ever feel the need to use fingers on me. Same with my 6 year old daughter, she has UTIs as well, and if a doctor were to feel like a pelvic exam was necessary, I would definitely be getting second opinions before I allowed it to happen.
TwoXChromosomes X In your sister's case, this is not necessarily due to any 'medicine' she took. When I first started menstruating at 13, I had no pain whatsoever and would have no idea I was even on my period unless I saw the blood. It was also pretty common for me to skip months at first, for no particular reason. Now, in my 20's, I have such awful cramps that I can't function normally for a couple of days out of every month. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've used the instead cup with great success.  I don't know if you meant you wanted to use it during sex but this also was fine.  I couldn't really feel it and my boyfriend couldn't either.  It was a good solution although my period was rather light at this time so it might be harder if your period is heavy.  Also it says it can be used up to 12 hours but I found it was best to change it every 4 hours (and change it before/after sex).     
TwoXChromosomes X Utah didn't criminalize miscarriage, they criminalized intentionally inducing miscarriage because a girl paid a guy $150 to beat her up while she was 7 months pregnant to give herself a late term abortion. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's possible though. My cycle is shorter than typical - took me a while to figure out when I was trying to conceive. If I remember right, the average woman is fertile a few days on either side of day 14 (day one being the first day of your period). I'm closer to day 8. The OP can check her mucus to see if that narrows it down.
TwoXChromosomes X All the terms are fundamentally flawed.  "Pro-life" people do not have a monopoly on "life."  It's a little ironic, to me, that the same people who will so zealously protect fetuses from murder generally have no qualms about executing people of any age, including some under 18, for whatever crime they think is severe enough, including, in some cases, homosexuality.  Many, if not most, though, are not "anti-choice."  They are all for adoption.  They just don't see abortion as a viable choice, being as how they see it as murder.  You can't be "tolerant" towards murder-- so yeah, to them, once a woman is pregnant, she can't kill the baby just because she doesn't want it, any more than a woman who just had a baby can kill it just because she decides she doesn't want to take care of it anymore.  I wouldn't go so far as to call any pro-choicers "anti-life," but some extremists do seem to actually be "pro-abortion."  I get the feeling from some abortion activists that they feel every woman has a moral obligation to have at least one abortion in her life, just because she can.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on Depo on and off for about five years, no periods (they took nearly a year to come back when I went off), and that was awesome.  Now, I'm back to having totally irregular periods. Sometimes they're two weeks, sometimes 42 days. :\ No love from my hormones.
TwoXChromosomes X People who are immuno-compromised or are particularly sensitive to *Candida* will have a much higher chance of getting a yeast infection.  Also if you regularly take antibiotics that can cause your natural balance off and allow the [Candida]( _%28genus%29#Species) to thrive.
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds like bacterial vaginosis. Semen makes it worse! Try condoms for a while and buy yourself some probiotics. You could also see a doctor and get an antibiotic prescription. Either way, make sure you take the probiotics to increase the good bacteria in your yoni.  EDIT: It's really common and, luckily, a quick fix. See your doctor. She/he will swab you and be able to tell you exactly what's going on.
TwoXChromosomes X It's quite conventional.  [To quote the American Academy of Family Physicians,]( ) "Boric acid, administered in a 600-mg vaginal suppository twice daily for two weeks and then daily during menstruation, has been effective in the treatment of women with resistant infection." In fact, in most studies that I was able to find, boric acid is MORE effective than what you call "conventional" treatments for recurring or resistant infections.  [This study]( ) shows its superior effectiveness in one type of yeast, and there are tons more if you just google.  
TwoXChromosomes X You can totally wear tampons, or diva cups, the IUD is actually up in the uterus (not in the vagina), the strings that do stick out are nylon so even if they do hang out they are not going to get 'snagged' on a tampon.  I have had the copper T for 3+ years now, and I have never had any problems with the strings being in the way, regardless of the guys' size, or menses control method. I can feel the strings hanging out of my cervix, but it takes some maneuvering to find them, and it just feels like less than an inch of fishing line (soft) stuck to the cervix. 
TwoXChromosomes X Not a lady.    I wouldn't like it if I were your SO.  I do not take five days off when my ladyfriends have their periods.  I do not want to take five days off when they might be ovulating either.    I think as a supplemental method, rhythm is reliable enough to significantly improve your chances of not getting pregnant over the IUD only.  But the withdrawal method would offer you fairly significant improvement over the IUD alone, as well.      I'm going to assume you don't use condoms in combination with the IUD, and that you've given him the option to use condoms during the days on which you could be ovulating, and that he's declined that option.    If that's the case, then I don't see anything wrong with it.  But if, for example, you're also using condoms regularly, or if he's willing to use a condom during those days, I think its kinda paranoid crazy to require abstainence.
TwoXChromosomes X I was planning on combining the condoms and the rhythm method so not use condoms except on the fertile days.  Edit: read your comment again, he doesn't much mind what method we use as long as we don't make a baby.
TwoXChromosomes X I have tried using these, and my problem isn't necessarily getting it in, it's that I feel it when it's in there. All. The. Time. It hurts so much that I can't sit down without something jabbing my insides. I even tried trimming the little thing that you pull it out with and that did nothing. Any tips or hints to wearing the cup in comfort?
TwoXChromosomes X I think that it is an amazing thing to do for someone. I'm interested in how much money you could actually make off of this. Pregnancy is no easy ride, well for me it wasn't. I had a couple friends who had perfectly easy pregnancies but I went through horrible morning sickness. It lasted the entire nine months of my first pregnancy and I am now seven months pregnant with my second and I have finally quit vomiting 6-8 times a day. It's so hard to continue on with life when you're constantly ill. The hormones are also a trip too. They do crazy things to your mind and body. Like I have an insane amount of hair that grows on my stomach and doesn't go away until I finish breast feeding.  
TwoXChromosomes X Additionally tampons suck moisture out of you--that's what they're designed to do, so they also absorb the natural moisture you need up in there anyway.  
TwoXChromosomes X Oi, the first time I tried to put it in was lying on the shower floor, and for some reason wedging it in at that angle causes all kinds of strife. Having something poking around your insides when you move is a freaking weird experience, hey? I seriously thought that my vag was just the wrong shape for this thing. But what finally worked for me was sitting on the toilet and *gently* pushing the folded-up cup towards my tailbone.  When it's properly inserted you can't feel it at all, it's actually kind of neat.  Good luck if you feel like giving it another shot. :)
Parenting X My wife and I had our first baby 14 months ago.  We used Dr. Brown's bottles and they were great.  I don't have any experience with any other brands - but Dr. Brown's worked for us.  I don't know if these bottles can prevent colic like they say they do, but I do know our little one never had it.    We got a 3 pack of the 8 oz bottles and that was all we ever needed.  Some people buy the smaller bottles, but then you just have to buy the bigger ones when your baby starts drinking more.   Buy the 8 oz from the start and you won't have to worry about that.  We started with the first stage nipples, and then went up to the second stage at about 4-6 months.  These bottles  do have a few extra parts to wash, but it wasn't too much of a hassle.    Our bottles weren't the same brand as my wife's pump, and they fit fine.  
TwoXChromosomes X I considered myself to have a heavy flow when I used tampons and pads. Super tampons leaked after 2-3 hours, tops. Pads about that long. I was in the bathroom constantly.  I've had a divacup for 6+ years and would never go back. Pop it in, 8-10 hours later I dump it out, rinse and reinsert. I've never fully filled the cup, but I've gotten close occasionally. It has measurements on the side so you can see how much collects.
Parenting X my wife breastfed and pumped and the Dr. Brown's bottles worked great for us too.  They have air flow that reduces the amount of air the baby swallows and therefore less burps too. We used the wide mouth bottles as they seemed to get the baby a latch more similar to a latch on a breast.
Parenting X We used these when our daughter was a newborn and they worked great. We did mess about a bit with some other bottles to see what worked best and came back to these.  One thing I will add, though: Once your baby is at an age when they're more confident with a bottle and not so sensitive to air bubbles and such you may want to try switching to a less exotic bottle simple to save time on washing the extra parts. I can't remember exactly when we switched, but at a certain point our daughter didn't show any preference between this and a cheap, easy to clean, no-frills bottle.
TwoXChromosomes X Everyone in my family has abnormal paps nearly every test, and all colposcopy results have come back fine.  It's not fun, but I've had worse experiences at the dentist. You'll be okay.  ::hugs::
TwoXChromosomes X Love the art!  I have a friend who has a lowish cervix, she needed to get a shorter cup because if the cup is past your cervix there will definitely be leaks.  Other troubleshooting:  Make sure the base of the cup is fully round and that it can turn in a full circle (not oval shaped).   Keep on truckin!
TwoXChromosomes X I used to have the same problem.  What I found worked for me was lots of experimentation; different positions, different techniques, different tools and toys.  Also, after asking a few times to stop, my partner stopped obsessing about my non orgasmic status and we both relaxed a lot more, which helped me reach orgasm.  The trick is to not worry about it, not think too much about it, and it will come when she's relaxed and having a very good time.    Also, [me and my friends love these freaking toys.]( ?collectionName=femme)
TwoXChromosomes X Fair enough, like someone else suggested you could try the hormonal IUD which, if I am not mistaken, can cause your periods to stop completely as well as possibly have a lower chance of the side effects you are experiencing.   If you really want to stay on the pill I would suggest trying a different brand every 3 months or so to see if you can find one that is better for you.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes!  And if you haven't gotten your HPV vaccination, please do.  If you are lower income, you can get them for free at Planned Parenthood.  Birth control is good too.  But insist on condoms and talk to the person about the last time they were tested if they've been sexually active.
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on whether they could get a prescription. Misoprostol has multiple uses. It does induce miscarriage early in a pregnancy, but when given postpartum, it stops hemorrhaging from traumatic births. In some places, it's legal as an antihemorrhagic, but not as an abortion drug.   I do not know if that's the case in Australia, but I could imagine someone trying to get their hands on it to avoid surgical abortion, if it were not readily available. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was on the Depo shot when I was 18 and it was horrendous!!! I was on it for 6 months and had my period every single day.  I became incredibly anaemic and was sick all the time.  I couldn't wait for it to be over.  
TwoXChromosomes X I am not a doctor but I've heard that the pills that have varying doses, if you want to skip a period, you take one pack in normal order, 1, 2, 3, you should then take the next pack in decreasing order, 3, 2, 1.  I just read this online so it is NOT the same as decent medical advice! But it does make sense to me.
TwoXChromosomes X its natural and healthy to breast feed until the baby is naturally weened.  as it gets older, and starts to enjoy regular food more, the milk will eventually dry up.  the whole 'if it can ask for it, its too old' thing is just a hang up for chicks sexually immature about their breasts
TwoXChromosomes X Everyone else seems to have addressed your BC questions well. I don't mean to scare or discourage you, but here are some things I wish someone had told me before the first time I had sex.  It'll probably hurt. A penis is an awfully big thing to put in there, before it gets stretched out a bit from regular intercourse, plus if you have a hymen still (contrary to popular belief, there are ways it can break before sex) it will probably break, hurt a lot, and bleed a bit.  The first time I had sex with my bf, it hurt like hell and we stopped. We tried again, thinking that now that the hymen was gone it wouldn't hurt...and it did.  The best way I found to reduce that pain to the point that sex is still pleasurable is to get AS TURNED ON AS POSSIBLE (like to the point where you're about to jump him if he doesn't get going soon) and use a lubricant to help--no matter how wet you are, it probably won't be wet enough, and wetter = less hurty.  Again, I don't mean to sound all negative. My first time was wonderful once I figured out how to make it stop hurting!
TwoXChromosomes X Screw condoms, get on birth control! :D  (Not promoting blatant unprotected sex or anything. It's just that the more protection, the better!)
TwoXChromosomes X The only thing I can tell you is to relax. If you are like me you will never get used to and stop hating it. A good dr knows how uncomfortable it is and are very sweet and understanding. They'll put you in a paper robe that opens in the front, and give you a matching paper blanket to lay across your lap while you wait. Then the dr will ask you to  lay back, put your feet in the stirrups and relax your legs so they fall apart. I always have a hard time with that since HELLO my vagina is hanging out, how do you expect me to relax? But they are patient so no worries. Once you're set up they insert the speculum which is usually cold and feels weird but it doesn't hurt. They'll insert a very thin, long stick with a little brush on the end to get the cells from your cervix. It doesn't hurt and takes all of 2 minutes at the most. Usually they will then do a breast exam on you (at least mine does or she just likes my boobies) then they leave to let you get dressed. Your vagina will be gooey from the lubricant they use to insert the speculum but they have paper towels/moist towlettes and that awesome paper blanket they gave you at first to clean yourself up. Dr will come back in and talk to you again in a few minutes. Very easy, very quick, very painless. The worst part for me is always the initial opening of my legs once they are in the stirrups. 
TwoXChromosomes X I always try to bring my DS or my ipod in with me so I have something else to focus on while my doc is poking around my lady bits. The speculum will most likely be very cold, they usually use a whole porno worth of lube and when they swab you it may pinch, if they're also doing an STD test it usually pinches.  If you're ticklish in the arm pit area the breast exam will probably tickle, wiggle your toes instead of punching the doctor.  That's about it. It's very simple, very quick, and pretty uncomfortable. 
TwoXChromosomes X That shit's cold!   But, seriously, just remember it's not awkward for the doctors.  They've seen everything.  Just be relaxed and it should be over in ten minutes.  You will probably get a boob massage (checking for lumps) so don't be freaked out - that's what they're supposed to be doing.  If it's a male doctor, you can request a female nurse to sit in with you if you'd like. 
TwoXChromosomes X So you honestly think people being offended by boobs trumps a baby's right to eat when they are hungry?
TwoXChromosomes X All the same, we only menstruate during part of the menstrual cycle. All fertile women are on their menstrual cycle all the time. Question is not properly formulated.
TwoXChromosomes X If you aren't in a monogamous relationship, condoms are a must (or are in the beginnings of a monogamous relationship). Otherwise, the pill is *a lot* easier. And who is to say that these women who benefit from better access to the pill will not use condoms as well? Doubling up on methods is a great was to reduce risk. And as you said, condoms protect from STIs. However, if pregnancy is an issue, the pill is going to be the best bet. 
TwoXChromosomes X No abortion, in fact abortions should be illegal. You had sex, that means you and your boyfriend should take responsibility and give birth to the child; you already made that choice. You could have used contraceptives to minimize the risk. You could have gotten a tubal ligation to eliminate the risk. You could have just not had sex. The fact is that when you have sex with a man you accept the risk of possibly getting pregnant.  I'm against abortions and financial abortions. There were countless other options. Now is the time to be responsible; you already made your choice. 
TwoXChromosomes X Are you trying to pull it straight out? Doing it like that will create some serious suction and be painful for you. There's a couple different ways to break the suction before pulling it out. The way I use is to pull it on an angle so the back comes out first. Waaaay less suction.  My cramps are exactly the same with or without the cup. I've heard of cramps getting better, not worse... but everyone's different! Stick with it, it might get better.
TwoXChromosomes X I donate to Planned Parenthood, and I am against funding birth control at the taxpayer's expense. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've tried Insteads before, and I don't know if the inside of my cooter is funny shaped or something but I could NOT get those suckers to stay around my cervix. It would be good for a little while, and then I'd feel a *pop*, and the leakeage would start. I tried pushing it as far back as it would go, behind the pubic bone, etc, but it just would not stay. Because of this, I didn't want to spend the $30 or whatever it is now on a Diva/MoonCup because I don't want it to just sit there and go to waste.
TwoXChromosomes X Well the fact that you are thinking about sex is a much better reason.   A gyno exam has everything to do with birthcontrol though. A pap smear is just part of it, they don't just do a swab. They look at all of your lady bits. They check out your uterus and everything up there. The make sure that you don't have a variety of different common problems. I really don't see a cause for your objection.   You don't have to be sexually active to have some of these things that they check for. 
TwoXChromosomes X Heh, not to me - I actually got *way* more laid-back when I got pregnant, and the other symptoms were also nothing like PMS. The main thins to remember is that every pregnancy is different (not just every woman, but every *pregnancy*) so it's impossible to generalize about symptoms.
TwoXChromosomes X What about a single parent who can't afford to take care of them? It seems to me the purpose of child support is to provide financially for the child. If we allow men to opt out of it, who will pick up the slack?
TwoXChromosomes X Canadian here - At every doctor I have gone to, both at University and after, they required a physical exam, including a pap smear, before they would prescribe birth control. If it had been more than a year since my last physical they would only give me 1 or 2 months of birth control and ask me to make an appt to have a physical before they would prescribe me a full year's worth.   I wonder if there is a difference in the recommended practices from the governing medical bodies in different countries regarding pap smears. The appointments and testing are covered by provincial health care here, but they are a hassle and not very fun, especially if they are overkill compared to what the rest of the world is doing...
TwoXChromosomes X As imabrickhouse said, the non-disposable variety are completely different. I couldn't get the hang of Instead either, but my Diva Cup is fine. It sits right where a tampon would sit.
TwoXChromosomes X They're not supposed to go up by your cervix. They will leak if you try to force them up. There are pretty specific directions in the package about how to orient them. The end is supposed to be barely inside the opening, and you have to push them in tilted back toward your tailbone. They're a bit fussier to situate properly than a tampon, but once you get used to it and good at it, they're a dream come true, and they're way less wasteful. 
TwoXChromosomes X Having a child and raising a child are both expensive.  The woman should take these financial issues into consideration when choosing whether to continue with a pregnancy.  I want to do a lot of things I can't afford, drive a Porsche, travel the world, build my own spaceship;  that doesn't mean that I should be able to rope someone into paying for it.  Finances need to be a part of family planning, at least this way the woman will be able to make a decision with the facts available to her.  There are reasons I am unsure about the idea of a 'financial abortion' but this is not one of them.
TwoXChromosomes X There is no way that any anti-abortion person could object to ending of an ectopic pregnancy. It's not a real pregnancy. The person who is pregnant just dies...period. There is no potential baby or anything.  It's not really an abortion. You have to kill the growing embryo inside the tube before the tube explodes. It can kill you.   Women who are dying for kids get ectopic pregnancies and terminate!!! Seriously, this is not a real pregnancy. There's ONLY one way to deal with it, no matter how pro-life you are. 
TwoXChromosomes X I am here to tell you a few things I have learned over 2+ years on-going monitoring (biopsies=colposcopies). I am 27 years old and the first time abnormal cells showed up in my pap smear was when I was 24 and still a VIRGIN. Yeah, that's right... life is cruel like that.  It is VERY important you get the biopsy (colposcopy). A friend of a friend's abnormal cells were detected too late at 27 and she passed away after chemotherapy at 31 this summer. Most women get these abnormal cells at some point in their lives, but monitoring it is so so crucial in preventing cancer in like 10 years (left unmonitored, these cells can morph into cervical cancer).  The colposcopy (biopsy) is uncomfortable, but it only lasts 3-5 mins if they know what they're doing. I would ask for a female doctor because my first colposcopy was a man and it was not as easy as my now usual female doctor. She and the nurse are like experts at it, and we always manage to have a laugh.  Do not have sex a few days prior! This will produce non-diagnosticable or inconclusive (not sure if that is a word?) results and it will be a waste of your time. Trust me, you do not want this. They will also tell you that you are not to have sex for 3-5 days following the colposcopy because your cervix needs time to heal.  In my experience (I've had 6 or 7 in the past 2 years because my low-grade cells just won't seem to clear), it is uncomfortable and makes me feel a bit weak for the rest of the day. If I had had the option, I would have taken the day off but it always coincided with a busy work day.  I've only ever had low-grade cells so I've never been referred for the the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, or LEEP procedure. I've been eating papaya and taking folic acid pills because apparently that helps... I'd do just about anything to clear these cells naturally.   Any other questions you have, please do not hesitate.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine disappeared due to stress.  It came back one day after a few months (four, I think).  I was worried because I had been completely regular ever since it started - I would know when my period was coming down to the hour even. After a pregnancy test and a few doctor's visits, it came back on its own one day and lasted two weeks.  The doctor was pretty sure the cause was stress.  The doctor put me back on the pill, but I have been irregular ever since, despite the pill. It is totally scary when your body does strange things! I agree with spunky-omelette though, the sooner you can get things checked out the better.  You will feel more at ease knowing what is going on.  This state of not really knowing is probably adding to the stress.
TwoXChromosomes X It's only one type of antibiotic where studies have shown it messes with Hormonal birth, it's only for Rifampin though. The others may have a very small effect, but no proof of them altering the effectiveness of the Pill   Never heard of the grapefruit + HBC. I thought that was just for heart medicines and anti-psychotics. Good to know. 
TwoXChromosomes X True. It's the folic acid in the vitamins. You could just take a folic acid supplement which is about 1/3 of the price. I took this for awhile and had to stop because it was getting out of control.
TwoXChromosomes X Check out the [2XC Birth Control List]( _now_2xc_here_is_a_list_its_up_to_you_to_make/) from the sidebar.  Another great place for personal IUD stories is [IUD Divas]( _divas) on Livejournal.  If you have a Planned Parenthood around, I hear they're very IUD friendly.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm currently doing a drug trial for a birth control pill.  Free pills for a year.  It's a pill that's already on the market with a slightly different dosage.  I've had no adverse side effects.  Maybe that's something you could look into if you're desperate.    Also, a lot of county health departments will provide cheap (or even free) birth control pills.
TwoXChromosomes X Nah, my doctor just told me that some of the symptoms I had on a low dose pill could possibly mean I was ovulating, so I switched to a high dose pill.
TwoXChromosomes X I wasn't a fan of breastfeeding. I breastfed my kids for a year each (including twins---one on each boob) but I never had this "Omigod breastfeeding is amazing!!!" feeling so many moms seem to feel.    I knew the benefits of breastfeeding, but never got the bonding thing. I think a formula fed child is going to bond just as well as a breastfed child. Breastfeeding was just a feeding choice for me, not a lifestyle.     I didn't hate it. I was just kind of "meh" on it. But I still did it anyway. Loving breastfeeding is not a requirement to be a nursing mother.
TwoXChromosomes X Pick up a bottle of iron pills when you go get pads. Extended bleeding like that tends to deplete your iron stores as your body uses it to make new hemoglobin, regardless of your protein consumption, though that certainly isn't hurting you either. If you're not low, extra iron still won't hurt. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was told that I wouldn't be a good candidate for an IUD until I'd had children. I know that, not having had children, I'm smaller and tighter, but I can't be so small that I physically can't fit an IUD!  This argument is an outdated one. IUDs have changed a lot since the 1970s but many doctors really aren't up to speed with the current IUD technology. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I finally got sick of wearing pads and for about almost four weeks now, I've been wearing tampons strictly 24/7. I have each one in for about 7 hours or so. I usually don't do this and switch them sooner than that (5 or 6 hours), but I've been going through so many tampons and can't afford to get any more. I also hate pads and get an allergic reaction to them and that sucks.  **Diva cup.**
TwoXChromosomes X When it comes to endometriosis, the truth is the size of the lesion is not correlated with the amount of pain. So you could have a lesion the size of a freckle, which would be almost impossible for a surgeon to find especially is it was on your bowel or something, and have pain like an elephant crushing your pelvis. So I don't think you should be mad with your doctor. I would check out a pain management specialist if I were you.
TwoXChromosomes X Endometriosis isn't visible on ultrasound or MRI. It can only be diagnosed through surgery. If you have the symptoms and they suspect it, you should get a laproscopy to find out/ treat it before it spreads.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on microgynon and it gave me really bad headaches (and I think it increased the frequency of migraines), as well as leaving me anxious and really easy to upset. It completely removed my period pains though, which was awesome. When I tried to get a re-prescription my doctor found my blood pressure has increased dramatically and was worried about the risk of a stroke. At 20. So needless to say, she wouldn't prescribe that again.  Instead I then tried a depo-provera injection which was the best birth control ever in terms of preventing pregnancy. I had absolutely zero sex drive, constant nausea, really painful periods which lasted weeks, and was so moody and upset I'm surprised anyone would want to be around me at all. And once you've had the injection the symptoms last 3-6 months - you can't just choose to stop like with the pill.  So no more hormonal birth control for me :)
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah I completely removed the stem too--it was always jabbing me uncomfortably.
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds like it doesn't fold out properly and/or it is inserted deeper than your cervix. Can you feel the stem? Then maybe you can just cut it off? Otherwise you might need a smaller cup. I hope you can make it work. Otherwise try later in life - cups are worth fighting for :-)
TwoXChromosomes X She does need to see a doctor. I started using birth control because my periods became increasingly painful and heavy.  The first one I was on didn't help, but the second one is amazing.  I have no problems now.  The pill controls periods really well.
TwoXChromosomes X This story nearly made me cry. What a great husband and father. Abortion protesters.....care so much for a small cluster of cells, but care nothing to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place. Don't seem to care much for all of the children out there who ARE BORN and in need of help so badly. Disgusting.
TwoXChromosomes X Not necessarily. I didn't have any itchies, cottage-cheese discharge (yum!) or any of the "bakery smell" that usually tips me off to a yeast infection. It just wasn't a bad one. Worth it to get checked out though, they can tell you in a few seconds whether or not you are yeasty
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;as soon as it starts hurting, it's like I dry up instanly or something  Yep, this would make sense. When it doesn't feel good, your body won't create the lube needed. Make sure you're nice and wet, either through him stimulating you with his fingers or going down on you so taht there's a mix of your natural lube AND his saliva.
TwoXChromosomes X Do you feel pain if you try and insert a finger or two inside your vagina? Or a vibrator or some other sort of sex toy or a tampon or something? If you do, it's possible it's vaginismus, when your vaginal muscles clench up almost automatically. This requires treatment and sometimes therapy.   However, if it's only when you're attempting to have sex with him then it's more likely to be that you're not turned on enough.
TwoXChromosomes X I've found lots of workout videos/dvds at Goodwill/Salvation Army. usually for under a dollar a piece.
TwoXChromosomes X I had Paragard inserted about 2 months ago. I only had very mild cramping the first day, spotting for a week or so, absolutely no problems since. The only "painful" part was the clamp, and compared to childbirth, or even normal cramps, it was nothing. Love it! So much less hassle than any other birth control. I had considered Mirena also, but cost was prohibitive, and also, I had concerns about it after I read so many horror stories here on 2X. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've really liked nuva ring, I've had zero side effects.  Next week though I'm switching to implanon, which is an implant in your arm that lasts 3 years :D I honestly couldn't imagine still having to take a pill every day....
TwoXChromosomes X &lt;3 the ortho patch for the same reasons as the person below &lt;3s the ring.. easier then a pill a day and no side effects (for me)
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds more like a strained [intercostal muscle]( _muscle) then - that can feel like anything from "a specific sharp pain in the chest or collar-bone" to "a giant sheet of pain running from your shoulder to neck, and down to your solar plexus". :-(
TwoXChromosomes X I've had some bleeding down there from some rough romping before... but it never lasted that long. Perhaps your movements throughout the day are just reopening the wounds and letting it bleed more? If it doesn't stop soon, I'd go see a doc for sure. But you should be fine.
TwoXChromosomes X i've had period clots that size, but not that color. it looks like it could have been a miscarriage... call your dr. you may have to get some internal stuff done...
TwoXChromosomes X Doctor's that I have worked with have refused to use copper IUD's... they seem to have higher rates of removal. In other words women experience more side effects and discomfort on them than the hormonal ones. But fyi, I have no studies to actually back this up. The main issues they told me about seemed to be constant spotting or bleeding.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, with mine I have to insert it a bit further in than the instructions say because it's uncomfortable otherwise. How much is a bit? I know that they say to use light liners in conjunction with the cup. Does it open up all the way once inserted? Do you insert halfway, twist (to create a seal) and insert the rest of the way?   How long have you had it? I've only been through one period so far and it happened to just work perfectly from the start. I've read reviews where it takes a cycle or two to get used to. 
TwoXChromosomes X I never had kids and went and got an IUD too, I wanted to get off of any hormone contraceptive. I have the 10-year Paragaurd. Getting it inserted was an absolute nightmare, I nearly fainted on the table. However, to me, it was worth it (my gyno says I can keep it in for 12 years instead of 10). I cramped really bad the first day after insertion. And now, I'm on my second cycle after having it, and its great, not having to worry about hormones or pills. I also just had my check-up last week to make sure it wasnt coming out, and everything is clear.   Personally though, my periods seem to be just as crampy as when I was on the pill, which when I didnt have any sort of birth control (IUD, hormone, or otherwise). Perhaps in a few months this will go away, we'll see. As long as I have a heating pad (or my laptop charger, as I discovered by [this]( _use_their_laptop_charger_to_make_cramps_more/) thread, pretty neat idea), I think I'll be fine. As for flow, my first period was super heavy, my second one, everything is back to normal. I haven't had mine long, but if you've got any other questions, I'll be glad to answer what I can about the Paragaurd. 
TwoXChromosomes X Though it doesn't happen frequently, there are times where I simply cannot climax during sex or even masturbation.  It's not that it doesn't feel good or that I'm too tired, but my pleasure simply never reaches that plateau before it; I'm caught on the brink, wanting to cum, but simply unable to no matter what.  There have been times where, having nothing better to do, my ex and I would keep going for another hour or two, until she's too sore to possibly continue, but still nothing.  It was extremely frustrating.  Eventually, I found something that worked for me: stop completely for five or so minutes.  Let it all fade away, relax.  Then continue.  Usually, when I did that, whatever barrier was in the way would disappear, and orgasm would come without any problem.  I can't say his problem is the same, but it might work.  After awhile, just stop everything, don't touch it.  If it deflates, cool, keep waiting.  Then start and see if he'll finish normally. 
TwoXChromosomes X Pregnancy tests never give a false positive.  They can give a false negative.    You're probably not pregnant and it is just stress.  Why wait for tomorrow to get a test?  In the future, keep an extra at home.  It'll ease your mind. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think this is good advice. I'm probably low on iron, too. Somebody else once told me that consuming more calcium might be helpful - anybody know anything about that?  &gt; Try adding dark leafy greens to your diet  But apparently [not spinach]( _that_the_big_spinach_salad_ive_eaten_every/)!
TwoXChromosomes X I have had two Mirena's, and while I have libido decrease on oral birth control, I have zero on the Mirena.    Mirena only releases levonorgestrel, a progesterone.  Some oral contraceptives are levonorgestrel only, but the most popular brands are a combination of estrogen and progestins.  The amount of progesterone released by Mirena is 1/10th the amount in a progestin-only pill.
TwoXChromosomes X People react differently to medications. This is neither new nor exciting - you probably just have a bad reaction to the hormones. It happens.  My experience with hormonal birth control is pretty much what you were expecting: my debilitating cramps vanished overnight, the bleeding was lighter, and my period became predictable. On the other hand, I found out (after taking this stuff for some ten years) that it lowered my libido by *a lot* and worsened my tendency toward depression.  If your reaction is that negative, just try alternate methods - I'm currently looking into IUDs, since I'm not willing to put up with the side effects (plus I have migraines w/ aura, which puts me at increased risk for stroke with hormonal birth control). The hormone-based IUD is supposedly more gentle on the body than the copper, and the dosage is so low and so localized that you're not supposed to get the side effects you'd get with the pill.  You could also try switching brands or going to a lower-dose variant.
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds like you have HPV and he wants you to undergo a cervical ablation? It sounds fine to put it off... in the US after an abnormal pap I believe you have several bi-monthly follow-ups before any procedures. I think you're right to wait, but maybe call your OB/GYN at home?
TwoXChromosomes X Get a second opinion.    [Cauterization]( -cauterization) is a [recognized procedure]( ) for inflammation of the cervix, but it is something that I would want a second opinion on (I'm Canadian).  It doesn't have anything to do with an abnormal pap smear if the infection started after your pap smear.   Yes, your cervix can hurt during sex- it certainly can cause more than a bit of a twinge if it's bumped during regular sex, so I would imagine that if you've had an infection it could certainly be more tender than normal.   Cervixes do have nerve endings, which is why pap smears aren't always comfortable.  I've had laser ablations, cryotherapy, and multiple colposcopies done because of abnormal pap smears, and the cauterization procedure sounds pretty similar to those.  It will hurt, but for a short time.  I would recommend being relaxed when you go in for the procedure, however you can accomplish that best (I do a shot of scotch and a Xanax).  You will likely have some cramping for a few days, and some bleeding/discharge, but it probably won't be worse than a normal period.   Do get a second opinion, but from what I could find out, it's not necessarily a bad option. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;How would it be ethical to deny someone the right to have their child come to full-term?  It's not a child. It's a fetus. Every fertilized egg does not become a baby. A fertilized egg has the potential to become a baby. In all early abortions it is that potential you are eliminating, not a baby.   The fact that men can't decide over womens abortions is due to the (un-?)fortunate fact that only women can get pregnant. Obviously its best if you consult with your partner in a situation like that, but no, they can't have that right because they can't get pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;If there was a way to remove the fetus from the woman and place in an artificial womb so it could be brought to term without relying on her body, then yes the father should have a say in preventing the abortion  What does that mean, exactly: the father should have a say?   if it was medically feasible to re-implant the fetus in an artificial womb or in anther women, but the mother wanted an abortion, then father could insist the fetus be removed and it would then be his child and the mother would have to pay child support to him?  or when you say the father should have a say, do you really mean that yet again only the mother gets to make the final decision and the father really has no say?
TwoXChromosomes X I recently went through an abortion, and I spoke with my SO about it.   We talked about it before ever having sex, that at this current time having a child would be financially difficult, as well as making it difficult for the both of us to finish our degrees. When I did happen to get pregnant, the situation was the same and we discussed this issue again. At first I was reluctant to get the abortion, then felt guilty because we had talked about it before hand, and came to the same agreement before we even had sex in the first place.  In the end it is ultimately the females decision what she does to her body, but the father of the fetus should also contribute to the discussion. If you both come to an agreement before ever having sex, then you should do the right thing and honor that agreement, unless circumstances change.      
TwoXChromosomes X They have some cheap stuff in there, but some really cute stuff also, and EVERY SIZE EVER!  Also, they're always very nice to me when I go in.  :)
TwoXChromosomes X i was on diane35 for years.  amusingly, it was the only pill i'd tried that *didn't* make me batshit. (alesse? omg. bad news bears.  and didn't even keep my acne away!)  i switched this year to yasmin - acne still gone, still not crazy.  might want to give it a try.  i think it's yaz in some places... anyway, the key thing that works in diane35 is the cyproterone acetate, which has an anti-androgen effect; that's what keeps the acne away.  yasmin has drospirenone instead, and a smaller amount of estrogen, but it's got the same anti-androgen effect.  win!
TwoXChromosomes X I already use the free Period Tracker on iphone. It's been a tremendous help to better understanding my cycle and moods. I don't know why some branded application would be any better.
TwoXChromosomes X more specifically, all hormonal BC elevates the risk of blood clotting slightly.
TwoXChromosomes X I love anal and anal play.  I may not always be up for anal, but I always I enjoy a finger there during sex.  My orgasms feel ten times better than just clitoral or vaginal stimulation.  
TwoXChromosomes X Here's one of many many things you overlook---  If a hetero couple is having anal sex, someone's hand or vibrator can be on the woman's clit.  Even if the woman in question doesn't get much out of anal, that doesn't mean that OTHER THINGS can't be going on at the same time.  Women  who fake generally are doing themselves a disservice as they outright lie to their partner.  She is robbing herself.
TwoXChromosomes X My boobs hurt for a few days before. I have fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, and right before, both flare. I get constipated as hell for a few days, until the day it starts, when the opposite happens. And the cramps start right after my period does, and they don't stop until the last day. There was a time I used to use a whole box of Midol every period. Now I just tough it out.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you ever seen the show I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant? You can have full on periods and be pregnant....
TwoXChromosomes X Why not? You keep blood splashing around inside your arteries for extended periods of time :) Menstrual fluid is natural and not going to do anything bad to you. Just empty the cup 2-3 times a day.
TwoXChromosomes X Hugs...I tried the depo shot and while the first month was great once my first period started it lasted for 5 (yes 5!) straight months.  My doctor convinced me that the bleeding would get better if I did the 2nd shot (you do them every 3 months) so I listened and did the shot, which signed me up for 3 more months of hell.  I became really anemic due to such heavy bleeding and blood loss.  Please go see a gyno to talk about your long period and have them make sure you aren't anemic.  Hope you feel better!
TwoXChromosomes X Nothing happened immediately following my insertion, but a couple of weeks later, I started spotting continuously and daily. It was extremely light bleeding, like only a few drops a day, but it was happening every single day, and it ended up lasting for about 12~13 weeks. Occasionally, it would get slightly heavier (but still super light compared to a real period), so that was probably due to my actual cycle. 
TwoXChromosomes X So I don't have my period for months, and then I get some spotting, and then I go months without it again.  I don't remember what it was like in the beginning (I've had it for four years now, on my second one).  Two months ago, though, I had very mild spotting for maybe two months straight.  It was the first time that's happened to me.  The doctor said I was fine and it's a mild price to pay for not having a period for 6 months.  It wasn't enough to merit wearing a tampon - a simple pantyliner was sufficient.  The major advantage to me, though, is the lack of emotional side effects.
TwoXChromosomes X Personally, I would never be able to give up my child for adoption. It just wouldn't sit right with me not to take responsibility for my own actions - whether to raise it myself, or to ensure that there is no child born into a situation where I couldn't do so.  If I were in her shoes, I would opt for abortion because of that. If I can't be the mother that the child deserves, there will not be a child.  But that's me. She's in a hard situation, and will need your support for whatever decision she makes. It may help to remind her that an embryo is not a baby, and she doesn't need to make decisions as if it was.
TwoXChromosomes X Pretty much. I just bought and started reading Taking Charge of your Fertility. It's the Fertility Awareness method (charting your morning temperature and cervical changes daily to learn when you are actually fertile). It's been highly recommended to me and I'm really digging it so far. Am going to start charting asap.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes! The package instructions detail this, but not as an extending option.  They say that if you happen to leave it in an extra week, you are protected, just switch it out and take your normal break.  I discussed this with my doctor as well and she said technically the hormones are effective ~5 weeks.  Double check the instructions for that note - wouldn't want it to have changed since I last used NuvaRing, as I'm on the Mirena now.
TwoXChromosomes X Buy a pregnancy test. Every time I had a scare seeing the negative test was always enough of a stress relief to get my period started within an hour or two.
TwoXChromosomes X Then, honestly, it's probably just stress. You both could be hyperfertile, but it's most likely stress.  When you do the pregnancy test, however, be sure to do it in the morning which is when the HCG level is the highest.
TwoXChromosomes X My period doesn't start until Wednesday of my inactive pills (I'm a Sunday starter). 
TwoXChromosomes X 1) Go to a doctor and get some antibiotics to clear up the infection.  2) She should be peeing after sex. Not 5 minutes, not 10 minutes, but immediately after sex.  3) I was in the same boat years ago with my now-husband. After some serious talking about hygiene, he would make sure to shower before sex and I would make sure to pee afterward. It helped a lot.  4) UTIs fucking suck. It's like you have no control over when you want to pee. Imagine feeling like your bladder is full right when you turn from the toilet. You don't know if it is or if it isn't - you don't know that if you relax and let it go, if you will urinate on yourself or if nothing will happen. I've never gotten the painful sort before.  5) IF SHE DOESN'T GO SEE A DOCTOR IT CAN TURN INTO A KIDNEY INFECTION. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had my Mirena for about 7 months.  I honestly couldn't really tell the difference between spotting and my period in the beginning.  At some point I figured out that the discharge during my period was a lot more mucousy than just spotting.  Now at around 7 months, I almost don't get my period.
TwoXChromosomes X What form of birth control is she using? Also, do you guys use condoms? I used to get UTIs from being on NuvaRing for birth control, and often some latex condoms would irritate me enough to cause one. 
TwoXChromosomes X I started reading "Taking Charge of your Fertility" which is about the Fertility Awareness Method. It entails getting very in touch with your cycle so you know exactly when you're fertile, and then avoiding unprotected sex at that time.  It is NOT the rhythm method. I am going to start charting my cycles just to understand my body better, even if I don't use it at my primary birth control method. 
Parenting X Are you the dad or the mom? If you're the dad, just remember that your job the first few weeks is taking care of mom - she needs all the help she can get as her body heals itself. Especially if she has a traumatic vaginal delivery or a c-section. Make sure she eats and drinks enough as well as takes the time to care for herself (shower).   Baby will tell you what he or she needs. Food, diaper, sleep. Limit stimulation for the first few months as babies can easily become overwhelmed. Don't worry about holding your baby too much -- you can't spoil them at this age!   If you're the mom... Don't worry about your house getting messy. It's part of having a baby. If visitors come over, hand the babe over and go take a nap. It's far underplayed how much healing a mom needs after 9 months of pregnancy and while you're bleeding. You are at risk of hemorrhaging the first week if you do too much around the house.   This is kind of random ramblings now, but remember that if you are the dad, you will once again become a lower priority in mom's eyes. There is another adjustment period. This too shall pass. Be honest and open with your communication. 
TwoXChromosomes X childbirth wasn't too horrible for me, I was induced with pitocin and had my daughter 10 hours later, I got an epidural 6 hours in and slept until it was time to push, and pushed for 15min and viola! Yeah it hurts but like others have said it is very, bearable pain because you know it won't last forever and you know on the other side of it you'll have a cute little pink baby that smells all delicious! I guess I had some baby blues or something, I remember being very upset about how "empty" I felt. My insides felt hollow. It came and went though. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;despite the fact that is is inherently dangerous for babies and mothers  No. Just no. Birth can be dangerous in high-risk situations but it is not inherently dangerous. I *really* don't like this woman. 
TwoXChromosomes X No problem and yeah I've seen the gauntlet, but I am still alive and kicking and no major problems either.  The emergency c section wasn't really all that different from the planned one with the exception that I was tired when we went in. Prep time, table time, etc were the same. It just made it harder to breastfeed initially also, but long run didn't affect anything.  I wanted to do regular delivery but between physical stuff that was going on (tilted uterus) and the fact that he wasn't making any progress we didn't have a choice, his heart rate was dropping, etc. So we did what we could to get him here safely even if it wasn't what I wanted. :)  As far as recovery time, it was the same with both c's I had, there was really no difference in that aspect. The type of medication was only slightly different also. Since I had an epidural I couldn't move myself to the table very well in comparison to scheduling it where I walked into the operating room and hopped onto the table before my spinal. My legs weren't numb with the spinal either like they are with an epidural. Either way they want you up and moving pretty fast which actually helps with recovery.  Information overload will definitely work against you! You'll be fine tho!
TwoXChromosomes X Also in the Northeast: Northface (find and outlet if you can) and LL Bean for my every day "i just want to be warm" jackets. For nicer coat like a peacoat I actually got a decent one at Target, but Macy's and Burlington Coat Factory are also really good options (oh, and tj maxx!). 
TwoXChromosomes X It is almost certainly nothing, especially if you take your birth control on time and accordingly (i.e., no antibiotics, no st john's wort, etc).  Even if you messed up with birth control, the condom + pulling out should have you more than covered.  If you can't convince yourself it's nothing, go get a test!  Target has 'em dirt cheap.  I know because I am similarly paranoid.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a student midwife. I've been to 22 births now, all out-of-hospital and unmedicated, and each so very different. I think one of the best things for labor/birth is support. Partners are great, but it's also great to have a doula (labor support person) who has been to a number of births and has a toolbox of her own to help you cope with labor. A book I highly recommend is Pregnancy, Childbirth and the New Born by Penny Simkin. I also recommend taking a Bradley childbirth education course. Having help and support lined up for the postpartum period will help with that transition. Congratulations on the pregnancy!
TwoXChromosomes X Getting an IUD (I have the copper one) was a fantastic decision. I don't have to worry about hormonal birth control and I haven't had a single problem with it in the six years I have had it. Periods were a little heavier, but the last few times I tried hormonal birth control I ended up in the hospital with kidney failure. I don't trust condoms alone. I had a difficult time finding a gyno that would put it in for me though. They wouldn't even do the sounding thing, they just said that since I hadn't had a baby they wouldn't do it. I haven't had any problems and don't really get why they were so opposed to it. Planned parenthood didn't give me any trouble about it when I explained the situation. 
TwoXChromosomes X I really liked that you don't have to worry about a pill every day (especially with my food allergies and intolerances that's a pretty big plus), but it did affect my mood. Not as much as the regular pill did, but enough for it to be noticeable to my then-boyfriend. And the worst part was that it slowly killed my sex drive (pretty common apparently with hormonal bc). Now that I'm single again i quit the ring and errr let's just say the sex drive is no longer the problem, but now I can't find a guy to share the joy. I can never win :(  tl;dr: nuvaring is awesome if you're not sensitive to the side effects normally associated with hormonal bc, if you are, the side effects will most likely be a lot less than with the pill
TwoXChromosomes X Same here. Awful experience, but worth it. I have the copper IUD and don't have to worry about birth control for 10 years!  My periods were painful and heavier at first. I am blessed with short periods though (only 4 days). They are still slightly heavier than they were but no longer painful.
TwoXChromosomes X Yep. I have this. I think it's called dysmenorrhoea. Maybe get it checked with a doctor. Mine sent me off to have a pelvic ultrasound as sometimes there can be a uterine problem causing it. He told me what, but this was ten years ago, and I don't remember. I didn't have it anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X Not all women produce milk in a sufficient quantity to feed a baby.  I had a friend who had a c-section and she NEVER produced milk.  Using the term lazy is a bit harsh as there are so many different factors that can impact the ability of a woman to breast feed their infant.
TwoXChromosomes X There is room here for both of you to understand the other's point of view, and you can begin by realising that an individual human life begins at the moment of conception, the fetus is alive, even if you grant it no rights
TwoXChromosomes X But BFing shouldn't be painful, but unfortunately there isn't a lot of support for new moms who want to breast feed and they don't get a good education on how to latch properly, and the fact that it takes a while to get a good supply and everything.
TwoXChromosomes X I would definitely talk to your gynecologist.  Even if you don't want to go with an IUD, you could certainly experiment with different types of hormonal birth control pills.  It may help!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Hmm but if the point isn't to use it for contraception, is it still considered contraception?  It's preventing the possibility of pregnancy, so yes, it is contraception. Sterile women can have sex. They're not preventing pregnancy, they don't have the option of becoming pregnant. (By the way, I believe another article stated that the rhythm method, in which women try to avoid having sex when ovulating, is supported by the church. And abstinence is also supported. It's only contraceptives that are forbidden.)  &gt;In my opinion, contraception AND protection should be available for everyone, regardless of gender, sexuality, occupation.  Well, we live in a capitalist country (or at least I do), so that might be conditional on your ability to afford contraception. In all seriousness, I do agree, and I have no problem with contraception being subsidized to some extent.
TwoXChromosomes X Not to completely freak you out, but have you gotten a clean STD test recently?  Chronic yeast infections can be a symptom.  Also - have you gotten a pap recently, to confirm it's not vaginosis?  Vaginosis can sometimes be mis-interpreted as a yeast infection.  Otherwise, I've heard: take lactobacillus supplements (lactobacillus lives there normally, and secretes peroxide which helps keep the area working properly, and suitably acidic - when they die off, the other less popular bacteria in the area will proliferate, and then you end up with yeast or vaginosis issues).  Lactobacillus like acidic places, so if the pH of your lady parts is off, they'll die.  If your gentleman friend's semen is a bit more basic than normal, that might be causing the trouble too.
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with the problem of affordability.  I think we should really be making an effort to make contraception available to people lower on the SES.  This would reduce abortion rates and likelihood of people having children they can't afford.   Anyways, back to the church.  I'm quite confused by the logic behind allowing sterile women/ natural means of contraception, yet not supporting modern contraception.  I thought the original logic behind this was that sex outside the intent to procreate was immoral, and thus contraception was immoral.  Yet if the church allows for sterile people to have sex or people to use cycles to try and avoid pregnancy, what is the actual logic behind it?   
TwoXChromosomes X Are you completely stressed out?  Are you dieting?  Exercising a lot?  There are a lot of factors that may cause you to miss a period or be late.  Your eggs alternate what ovary they come out of each month, and maybe you have a lazy ovary.  Maybe it decided to take a vacation this month.  Who knows.  If you're really concerned, go see a doctor and get a professional opinion, as that may help with any stress problems you may be having.    My periods are mostly regular, but then, surprise!, it came a week early.  Then decided it'd stay around for 2 weeks.  Meh, it happens.  Being a girl is fun!
TwoXChromosomes X LB has been getting more expensive over the past few years, Maurices plus line is amazing, I have quite a bit of their stuff now, it is best to get it on sale though since some stuff id over priced.
TwoXChromosomes X Just to repeat what everyone else is saying, there are lots of simple things that can cause this, HOWEVER, there are so not so nice things that can cause this too, and this might be a symptom of the beginning of hormonal imbalances, cyst issues, tumours, etc. and all of those delicious things that can cause problems besides missed periods. Although the chances of these being the problem is low, if you have insurance (assuming you are in the US) then go and get it checked out just to be sure. The earlier you catch bad stuff, the better. That being said, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  Plus, if it becomes a constant problem, your doc will have your blood work and ultrasound on file and can track any changes that occur.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not even sexually active, but I miss periods all the time. Stress, depression, ultralow body fat, illness, etc. conspire to keep me super irregular. I usually end up with about periods 6-10 a year, with anywhere from 28 days to 4 months between them.   However, if this is unusual for you, and you don't have any of the normal triggers, definitely talk to a doctor about it.
TwoXChromosomes X First off: Have you ever had an orgasm? How old are you?  Second: It's different for all girls.  Some can cum at the drop of a hat, for some it takes half an hour, and some have trouble geting off at all.  I think all women are capable of orgasm -- some just haven't figured out the right technique or have some kind mental wall up when it comes to masturbation.   Since getting off by hand can be difficult when you're new to it and don't really know what you're doing, my advice is to get a cheap but powerful vibrator.  The little bullet-style ones are great.  It'll be the best $10 you ever spend.  If you're not comfortable with buying a vibrator for whatever reason, try using either a detachable showerhead or the bathtub faucet.  The intense sensations from a vibrator or showerhead will help you get off a lot quicker than the "manual" method.    
TwoXChromosomes X Assault is any intentional act that creates and apprehension in another person of harmful or offensive contact.    So yes, just rubbing your penis up against someone who doesn't consent to it, is assault.
TwoXChromosomes X Try insteads first, then move to a cup. As much as I loved the switch to tampons from pads, the switch from tampons to insteads were better. I've had to go though a few cups to find one I like (divacup) the insteads are amazing!
TwoXChromosomes X SheCup is a menstrual cup brand that is manufactured in India that I know a few people who use.    I would say it depends on the reason that you don't like tampons.  A menstrual cup won't be scratchy or drying like a tampon because it doesn't absorb moisture (in fact it leaves my moisture balance completely alone which I love).  Some women have trouble inserting it, but I find once it's in I cannot even feel it.  You could feel differently, but I'd certainly recommend that you try it if you think it could work for you.
TwoXChromosomes X If they are uncomfortable with dryness, you might be better off with insteads or menstrual cups. I found tampons drying and would often get infections right after my periods, which a doctor told me was really the issue with tampons, not TSS, which, while much more serious, is fairly rare. 
TwoXChromosomes X The cup takes a little practice to figure out how to get it in correctly, but if your flow isn't incredibly heavy, you can leave it in for 10-12 hours at a time. If you're not near a sink, you can wipe it with a bit of toilet paper and put it back in. It's definitely a big plus for not causing a lot of waste, and it pays for itself very quickly. Plus you can put it in before your period if you think it might be due, so you minimize the problem of spotting.
TwoXChromosomes X combined with the acidity of normal vaginal secretions, it's supposed to help protect against infection, on top of the fact that, as your reproductive organ, it's full of extra blood vessels.
TwoXChromosomes X Most people **don't** have to change their cup 10x a day.  I change my once or twice a day and that usually means I can avoid changing it at work or in a public restroom.  For the times when I have had to use one, I find the handicap stalls really useful because they generally have sinks inside the stall. For me menstrual cups are a much more convenient and comfortable way to handle my period, with the benefit of saving me money and helping me contribute less to landfills.  If it wasn't convenient and comfortable I don't think I'd stick with them.  
TwoXChromosomes X My flow has always been heavy, and has become extremely heavy since having kids.  I LOVE my Lunette cup.  On my very heaviest of days I can make it through 4 hours at night before I have to empty it.  Before, I was changing Ultra absorbency tampons every hour.  It's super easy to change once you get used to it.  I was worried about the cup working for me since I bleed so much, but I will NEVER look back. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I too switched from tampons to the diva cup 2 years ago. I was tired of buying tampons and having to change them every few hours. With the divacup I can leave it in for 12 hours or so. I just empty it once in the morning and once at night. I like to say I "set it and forget it" cos of how little times I have to empty it. I used to have problems with it leaking so I bought the bigger size and that drastically reduced the leaking. It's not much bigger but it makes a difference. Also I changed from the "U fold" to the "Push down fold". I find the latter much easier to insert.   *The 'U' Fold (also called the C Fold):  Press the sides of the cup together and then fold it in half again.   The 'Push Down' Fold:  Holding the cup between your fingers, place your index finger on the rim of the cup. Punch down one side of the rim into the base of the cup to form a triangle. The opposite, remaining side will now appear as a small tip which is easy to insert.*  After I insert, I twist it a full circle to make sure it's opened up all the way and forms a seal. It takes a few tries to get it right but it's worth it! I'll never go back to tampons again!
TwoXChromosomes X What works best for me is boric acid. If the Diflucan doesn't clear up your symptoms, ask the doc if he'll prescribe boric acid. It's more of an old-school treatment, but it works every time for me.
TwoXChromosomes X The pill manufacturers themselves will tell you that it actually happens.  That's what "over 99% effectiveness with perfect use" actually means: a small fraction of a percent of women who use birth control pills perfectly will get pregnant every year.
TwoXChromosomes X I'll be honest; I have a Mirena and insertion was a bitch, the bleeding part sucked, my acne is marginally worse, and my periods are still wonky, but are much crampier (though lighter) than before, and the hormones do affect me a bit.    It is 100% worth it. Worry free birth control, no condoms, 5 years, cost effective...way too good to pass up, imo.
TwoXChromosomes X skipping the placebo pills shouldnt affect the efficacy of your birthcontrol.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; The nurse said it could be up to six months before I would experience a bad period,  This is not entirely incorrect, but it's pretty close.  I was on a POP before getting Paragard and having two periods a month when I decided to make the switch.  What I was told - and what proved to be true in pretty much every case I've heard about - is that paragard *makes your periods worse* for up to six months because of two things: one of its side effects is increased flow and cramping (which is why it's contraindicated for women who already bleed heavily), and (if you happen to have been on HBC) your body is withdrawing from the hormones and actually growing a uterine lining, so your periods are going to get worse than they were on HBC anyway.  The first thing you really can't do much about; it's better for some and worse for others.  But it does get better, usually in about six months (and it was about five for me, and the first one was miserable but they got better each time, and only having one a month was such a relief I didn't mind), and it was my experience that the periods got better and stayed better (I've had it for a little over a year).  As for the second one: that countdown to returning to normal (i.e., non-pregnancy-imitating) menstrual cycles can't and won't start happening until you stop taking the pills.  FWIW, I was told to use my HBC for a month after, if I recall, though they told me that it was effective immediately but it would make my first period easier if it were lightened because of the hormones, and that the first one after getting Paragard put in is always the worst and then things settle down immensely (I found this to be true).
TwoXChromosomes X well almost every time upon initial penetration it hurts, sometimes so much so that we have to stop, but usually that subsides, sometimes though, it's pretty intense pain until it's over, i always just figured that's how it is for everybody, cause it's always been like that for me
TwoXChromosomes X Are you on any antidepressants or antianxiety drugs? This can cause it. Now, I'm not saying if you are you should discontinue them, but speak to your doctor instead, there are other medications you can use for depression/anxiety that don't have this side effect.   PS: Just a wild guess since you said you had PTSD/depression/anxiety before. 
TwoXChromosomes X I took the pill for 18 months when I was 19, I had no side effects. I have other friends who also take the pill and have no issues. I have a copper IUD now and only have the predicatble side effect that my period is heavier.  TBH, if you haven't gone on HBC before, I'd recommend that you don't immediately get Depo Provera (the shot) as you don't know how it will affect you and you might want to try something like the Pill first, where if it goes badly, you can stop taking that type and try a new one and see if it works better, rather than just having to sit it out for the next few months while it works its way out of your body.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm the same as you, and it took me a while to find a partner who could give me many orgasms. I usually have between 5-10 when we have sex (including foreplay).     I think the problem with finding a partner for women like us is most guys just feel like if youve had one, they can stop trying and just pound you completely unstrategically and cum right after. You've got to let them know that while one is great, there's more in the bag.     When I'm masturbating, I still have trouble not just giving myself a huge one and feeling "alright that's good." Though after a minute or two, I can go for another.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Research has proved that women who use the pill as a contraceptive, on an average gain 10lbs during the first year of its use. Birth control pills that contain high levels of estrogen can cause water retention in body that makes you look like you have put on weight. Combination birth control pills can cause an increase in the appetite of women due to which they eat more and put on weight. Depression that is caused by the pill can also cause women to eat more and put on a few pounds.   from here: -control-pills-and-weight-gain.html
TwoXChromosomes X The only one I've had no side effects from is straight up progesterone (no estrogen), but I've also been told it's less effective as BC (I'm taking it for endometriosis).
TwoXChromosomes X I used to be one of those people who couldn't take the pill because of the hormones, but I'm fine on Implanon.  The difference is that with the pill, you have a hormonal spike everyday, twenty minutes after you take the pill, which then slowly wears off until you take it the next day.  With Implanon, you receive an constant dosing for three years, with no ups and no downs.  While you are definitely receiving hormones, they're so steady that your body is able to adjust around it within a few weeks of taking it.    I've never met anyone on Implanon (after their initial two weeks or so) who has experience any hormonal side effects aside from not getting pregnant or disrupted periods.  This is why people say it doesn't affect their hormones.  Of course it affects their hormones - but it's so constant and steady that we're able to adjust to it.
TwoXChromosomes X If I were you, I would be switching to something else. Unfortunately there's no way to know if something will work for you without trying it yourself. Maybe the first one you switch to will be perfect or maybe you'll have to try a lot.   Switching to a different progestin may work, or a different amount of estrogen, or switching between monophasic and triphasic. I don't know off the top of my head what exactly Yaz is. Usually doctors want to try you on low estrogen pills unless you demonstrate a need for higher estrogen or you request it.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're 35 and you don't want more kids, why don't you consider getting your tubes tied or one of the other super-permanent alternatives. Besides if you change your mind about kids, you can always adopt.
TwoXChromosomes X You say that it's more pleasurable when you pleasure yourself. Is it an orgasm then, do you know?  I find it very hard to orgasm during sex, but often I will feel very good and satisfied afterwards. I orgasm when pleasuring myself. So I know there's a difference. I accepted this as being normal for me.  (hi, secret santa)
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I can't do hormones.  I got a Paragard.  The cramps are painful, more painful and more frequent than pre-IUD, but it's really my only option.  I accept the cramps as the price to pay for worry-free sex.  Pain is easier for me to deal with than hormones because I'd rather be in pain than be batshit insane.
BabyBumps X Thank you so much!! I'm actually somewhere around the 9 week mark, although on my next appointment the doc said he's going to be able to narrow it down to almost the exact day within 1 or 2 days, so we will find out! 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I know dozens of women personally who have experienced side effects bad enough to switch types over and over before all of the bullshit comes to be too much and they quit hormonal BC for good.
TwoXChromosomes X It might in some cases, but there are people like my sister and sister-in-law who've had to try several different hormonal methods in order to find one with tolerable side effects. When you go through a chain of 6 different brands of pills, plus the patch, plus the shot, plus the implant, it's pretty clear when it's BC fucking up your system.
TwoXChromosomes X I second this.  I've tried out 3 different kinds (so far) and for me the Lady Cup works best.  I have difficultly getting a good seal on other cups, but for some reason the Lady Cup works perfect.  Maybe you just need a softer cup too?
TwoXChromosomes X Huh. Pretty sure I said:   &gt;You could consider paps to be CYA for doctors dispensing birth control in the event they are providing BC to a woman who is sexually active and later discovers she has cervical cancer that would have been caught years ago had her BC prescribing doctor provided the annual pap which is an accepted standard.  It's not absurd in our overly litigious society. CYA = cover your ass.
Parenting X My husband and I disagreed on circumcision for our boys.  I was against it he was for.. he is circumcised so he prefers it I suppose.  I laid out my argument, but, I ultimately let my husband decide.  I didnt like that he chose to go ahead with genital mutilation, but at the same time, I dont believe that my boys will suffer any because of it.  I believe that whatever they grow up with will be normal to them, and they probably wont even question it.  I dont think circumcision is necessary, but, its probably not the worst thing that can happen.  
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks to the smears, they can find the cells now in a very early stage. That is very good news, actually! Please don't be too scared by the pre-cancerous, it really means they found it before it could become cancer. And it could be years and years before cancer would develop, but in your case, now that they found it, you'll be treated and you'll be fine.  In the Netherlands, they are called agitated cells, which is the same but sounds much better. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X The new recommendations for waiting til 21 for your first pap has NOTHING to do with your lady parts not being fully grown down there. It has to do with the time it takes for an HPV infection to turn into full blown cancer, which is a very very long time. And it's not the gyno just scaring her. A pap test is first screened by a cytotechnologist and then by a pathologist. It's normal to get a pap test every 6 months after having an abnormal pap to confirm that the lesion is definitely gone and not returned.  The only thing right with this comment is getting an HPV test. There are a few certain things that can mimic a high grade lesion (very few). If the HPV test comes back positive, then go for the colposcopy. If it's negative, then if it were me, I'd have a repeat pap in 3-6 months. For what it's worth, I'm a cytotech. They might not do it though because of costs. It might be worth the reassurance and peace of mind to just go for the colposcopy.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you had your thyroid checked? A blood count drawn? Anemia and hypothyroid, among other things, can both lead to fatigue, excessive sleep, and depressive symptoms. Please get a thorough physical to ensure that there is not another medical problem causing or worsening your symptoms.
TwoXChromosomes X Please remember that anyone who will be at increased risk for DVT while using hormonal birth control will have an even more increased risk for it during pregnancy. Working in healthcare, I see my share of pregnant women using what you are using (it's not called Lovenox here) for most of their pregnancy :\  It's not the evils of hormonal birth control per se, but the "evils" of hormones in general. Please use non-hormonal contraception or hormonal contraception your doctors say you can use and plan carefully if you want to get pregnant.  The risk for blood clots is the highest when one just has started, or switched birth control methods, so I figure I'm safe. No history of blood clots in the family, and I've been on Yasmin the last five, no six years, plus no other risk factors. Still worth knowing about, even though DVT is actually relatively rare.
TwoXChromosomes X It's not a good one.    Withdrawal, actually, is more effective than diaphragms, using perfect-use figures. Withdrawal has a 4% fail, whereas the diaphragm has 6%. I'd go with an IUD instead.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, she should absolutely look into fertility awareness methods (FAM), sometimes called natural family planning (NFP). This isn't just the rhythm method - it involves getting to know your body and being able to recognize the physical signs of ovulation. If she really won't agree to take any pill or get an IUD, NFP is a great secondary birth control method. Just use condoms all the time, and around the time when she's ovulating, don't have sex at all to be safe. Done *correctly,* I think NFP is around as effective as condoms just on its own. Combine with condoms and I think you will be pretty safe.
TwoXChromosomes X We keep a pretty close eye on women and their baby prenatally and in labor and will go to the hospital if anything shows that the mom or baby are in distress or are heading in that direction. What a lot of people don't think about is that birth is a normal process. Our bodies are made to do it. For healthy women without risk factors, out-of-hospital birth is perfectly safe. We carry meds like pitocin and methergine to stop a postpartum hemorrhage, we have oxygen tanks and are certified in neonatal resuscitation, we have IV fluids, epinephrine, etc. We also have lidocaine and suture material to repair lacerations. We're prepared.  One of the things that people consider when deciding on a home or birth center birth is proximity to the hospital. The birth center I work at is less than 5 minutes from the nearest hospital, so we can get there quick in an emergency. Again, we risk women out of care if we don't think they'd be safe to deliver at home.   When I have a baby, I'd like to do a home birth, probably in the water. I wouldn't want to have to get in a car and go anywhere when I'm in labor and I wouldn't want to have to put my brand new baby in the car to go home.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks! I checked out the Planned Parenthood website like bananasaurusbex suggested, it said that with combination pills if you miss 1-2 pills between days 3-21 a seven day backup isn't needed. If I do need to in the next couple of days, I'll probably use backup just to be safe. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had abnormal cells. The doctor said it was due to HPV. I asked how I could have HPV since I had only been with my husband and he had only been with me. She tested and I was negative. She was very surprised by that.    So yes, I'm here to tell you that one can have abnormal cells and not be HPV positive.    Also, some more encouragement---I think most women get an abnormal pap at some point. Usually it turns out to be nothing. Mine was rechecked six months later and was completely normal. It's hard not to worry, but try not to.
TwoXChromosomes X It's probably due to cost. At the hospital where I work (US), the advised protocol is to do an HPV test on ASC-US and ASC-H results. This is because it's unsure if the cellular changes seen are actually do to HPV or maybe something else completely benign. It's slowly gaining acceptance in the US for insurance companies to cover this. Most places don't do HPV testing for LSIL or HSIL because it basically means, yeah ya got HPV. Recently research has been done to see if HPV testing would be a better test for cervical cancer screening. I believe the recommendation is that if you test positive for HPV then you should go in for paps. (I don't remember the paper right off hand.) The argument against this though is cost and the number of women that would be HPV + anyway. HPV testing is still a bit costly and paps are still pretty damn cheap.  The vaccine tho, that boggles my mind. Preventive medicine is usually cheaper than reactive.  Not wanting to do another pap is not strange at all. It sounds like you will be going for a colposcopy? That's pretty standard. Colposcopy and biopsy are the golden standard for diagnosis of cancer and dysplasias of the cervix. Pap tests are done instead of colposcopys because I mean, really? Who wants a piece of their snatch ripped out every year? Instead, a doc "gently" scrapes some cells off. I use quotes because it sure as hell doesn't feel gentle!  I've had a colposcopy and biopsy done. Other than being even more awkward than a pap, it wasn't bad. Mine didn't hurt, but I think it depends on how much tissue the doc is grabbing. Supposedly the cervix doesn't have pain nerve endings. That is still up for debate among many women.  Good luck to you and take care of yourself!
TwoXChromosomes X Colon cancer can be *prevented* by regular colonoscopies. They remove precancerous polyps while they're up there so you won't ever develop it in the first place. It honestly has to be one of the most preventable cancers, and too many people know nothing about it.   If you're over 40, get the pooper scope! It's a good decision.
TwoXChromosomes X I thought I had a really heavy period. I went through a ton of tampons daily because they would fill up and leak. I was in the bathroom 3x as much as I even needed to be, paranoid and checking for leaks.  I've used the Diva Cup for 6+ years and it really does change the way your period works. I pop it in and go 8-12 hours without removing it. No leaks. If you get a good seal, it doesn't matter how much you bleed. I only have to go to the bathroom to use the toilet. I spend so much less time and energy dealing with my period. And so much less money, too.
TwoXChromosomes X if you're already changing tampons so often how would something you have to empty less often not be feasible? just be careful to keep it upright as you remove it while sitting on the toilet then tip the contents into the bowl. on my heaviest days I'll fill it to the top more than once and I've never had a problem emptying it in a public bathroom and just wiping it out with toilet paper. I used to bleed through a few super tampons a day all the time on comparable days. 
TwoXChromosomes X There are sometimes, especially at the end of my period or at night, when I really hate the idea of having something inside me. I still have tampons and pads on hand from before, so I will use a pad for those times. I know where you're coming from with that, definitely.
TwoXChromosomes X So...um, this has me worried. Did your periods hurt before? Or does going off the pill mean a few painful periods to start out with?
BabyBumps X At 6 weeks that's very common (and so is the light cramping).  As long as it isn't consistent or getting any worse, it should not be cause for alarm.  When in doubt, you can always call your doc/nurse/midwife.  The Mayo Clinic Guide is my favorite pregnancy book, and it has month-by-month lists of symptoms that may be scary.  It clearly says which ones are normal and which ones should cause alarm.  I found it very reassuring, so I'd certainly recommend it.  Congratulations, by the way!
TwoXChromosomes X It actually does both. The pill *should* prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg, but it also has a back up layer. It thins the lining in the uterus to make implantation much more difficult. Progesterin only pills are less successful at preventing an egg from releasing, so this back up layer can be quite important.  tl;dr: Most of the time, the pill prevents the release of an egg; sometimes it only prevents implantation.
TwoXChromosomes X Is this to say, look if you find it beautiful? I've read all the comments and the majority in favor say it should be public since its natural. Is that to say then that anyone can look? If its so natural and beautiful and they're doing it in public I can't really be shamed for looking can I? I'm just wondering if this is why having it private should be better. You say " if you don't like it then don't look". Couldn't I say, "if you don't like me looking don't do it in public".  I know staring is rude regardless, but what I'm getting at is this, if we should lose the stigma behind public breast feeding, we need to de-sexualize the breast. Does this also mean women need to feel ok with people watching them do a natural act?  Edit : clarity and this - the last part means eg. You can openly look in the direction of a topless man oiling up at the beach. You would feel very awkward looking in anywhere close to the direction of a topless woman oiling up at the beach.
TwoXChromosomes X If you have regular cycles, you can always monitor discharge too. Start keeping good track of your periods and your wet days. We used this for two years, and used condoms when I was possibly ovulating. And don't get caught up in the heat of the moment when you *are* ovulating.
TwoXChromosomes X They can last that long, but it's not normal and usually you need to be put on some kind of medication.  Healthy periods should not last more than a week, and the average period lasts only five days.
TwoXChromosomes X Absolutely go see your doctor.  The infection can spread to your kidneys causing an even more serious infection.  A week's worth of antibiotics is probably all you'll need.
TwoXChromosomes X You should see a doctor if you can.  Since you've had this for a few days and it came back you might need to take an antibiotic.  In the future, at the first sign of a problem, take cranberry juice pills (available at CVS, etc) or drink lots of cranberry juice and drink lots of water.  
TwoXChromosomes X I nearly died from a kidney infection that had similar symptoms, and basically no others. I ended up in the emergency room and hospitalized for a week. Do not mess around. Go to urgent care now.
TwoXChromosome X _of_birth_control_methods  scroll down and you can see a detail of every type of birth control, including "typical use" failure rate and "perfect use" failure rate.  Condoms are only 85% successful for the typical use...not so great.  I'd definitely do what you can to get something more effective.  
TwoXChromosomes X It's VERY unlikely to get pregnant with an IUD. It can ease your comfort, but my doctor said a lot of times you'll get all the PMS symptoms (which are a lot like pregnancy) but just not get a period with the IUD. 
TwoXChromosomes X don't expect to hurt and bleed. some do, some don't.  you're older, which means you might have gotten all that hymen/first-time penetration business out of the way, just going about your adult lady stuff. i was about 19 when i lost it and it didn't hurt a bit. but making yourself nervous could, ahem, clench you up, which might make things uncomfortable. just relax.   
TwoXChromosomes X I ended up opting for a c-section the day before my due date. She was measuring 9+ pounds on the ultrasound, but more important her abdominal to head ratio was on the large side where she was falling into the category of having to break her shoulder, or something even worse if I was going to deliver vaginally. She ended up being 8.6 pounds and 21.5 inches long, and I did have to be cut more then usual because she wasn't fitting out of the regular cut they made because she was broad.   I loved my c-section, it was fast and easy and I don't regret my decision. I do wish though that they would have induced me at 38/9 weeks though so then I she wouldn't have gotten much bigger and I could have had a vaginal delivery. Hopefully next time I'll be able to have a vaginal birth. 
TwoXChromosomes X Iron pills made me sick when I was pregnant, but I was slightly anemic. What worked was cooking all my food in cast iron pots. Just enough iron leaches into the food to cure the anemia without the side effects from iron pills.
TwoXChromosomes X The reason I went on birth control was to prevent pregnancy. It didn't mess up my period or anything. And besides, I wouldn't have minded very much if it caused it to become irregular as long as I didn't get pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X Might be depression... whatever it is go to see different doctors until they can help. If it's not depression, thyroid is likely, or another you might have mild chronic fatigue syndrome or something similar?
TwoXChromosomes X What was your thyroid imbalance like?  Hypo or hyper?  What supplements are you taking?   There are so many more little symptoms that I haven't mentioned so I think it's funny that people with thyroid problems are able to so quickly identify with the general symptoms I listed.  I'd love to hear more about it if you have a chance.
TwoXChromosomes X Men can have many types of STDs with no symptoms and pass them onto partners! Up to 50% of men show no symptoms for chlamydial infections.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure, my boyfriend doesn't have a problem with having sex during my period. I just prefer not to personally. So I like giving him blow jobs during that time, or anal if I'm into it. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have never heard of the pill making anyone's periods less regular. The pill does have potential negative (and some positive, I think) side effects, but these do not affect most people, and it's definitely worth trying it if you have a reason to be on the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X No, the peeing afterwards is to flush your urethra, which can get bacteria in it from all the bumping and grinding and give you a urinary tract infection (UTI). Note that I don't think this is proven, but it works for my friend who gets UTIs every time she doesn't pee after sex (and gets no UTIs when she does pee). She's very susceptible to UTIs; she says she has to pee within 10 minutes. I don't always pee after, and I've never had a UTI. So it varies from person to person. [Here's a decent source.]( -time-does-peeing-after-sex-protect-you/) I can't find anything legit.
TwoXChromosomes X What I'm pointing out is that a pap *can* detect at least one STD, which is HPV as that causes abnormal cervical cells. 
TwoXChromosomes X The pap smear does NOT detect the presences of HPV, only abnormal cervical cells. It wasn't until after I'd had an abnormal pap smear that I even understood what they were checking for. At that point they ran a blood test to check for HPV. As others have stated though, HPV is not the only cause of cervical cancer.
TwoXChromosomes X So if your criteria for whether or not a life should live or die is innocence, because you believe murderers should die, do you really believe that a woman should have to carry a fetus created by rape or incest?  Because from that stance, no matter who the father or the context of conception, the fetus is an innocent life and thus killing it would be immoral.  What if the pregnancy will endanger the life of the mother?  Whose life takes precedence -- that of a grown woman or that of a few undeveloped cells?
TwoXChromosomes X Just to clarify, the Pill works by sustaining the levels of hormones a woman experiences pre-ovulation (this is the period of time when there is the lowest chance of pregnancy, the time people try to exploit when using the "rhythm method"). This is important for several reasons.  The hormones in the Pill stop ovulation. If there's no egg, there's no egg to fertilize. But is that fails and an egg (or eggs) is released, the Pill also maintains the tough, rigid, dry state of the cervix without ovulation hormones. If no sperm can get through, nothing can fertilize the egg(s). But if that fails and sperm can get through and also happens to fertilize an egg if it's there, the Pill also maintains the pre-ovulation thin lining of the uterus. Without the thicker, nutrient rich lining, a fertilized egg cannot implant (which is the medical definition of pregnancy because pre-implantation, there is no change on the female's body and zero chance of the fertilize egg developing past a few dozen cells).   Side note, this thick uterin lining is what becomes the placenta if pregnancy occurs. It is also what is shed during a regular period (which is why there are sometimes clumps in menstrual blood). When on the Pill, this lining isn't created and therefore can't be shed. So, the bleeding experienced during the "off" time off a Pill cycle is not a normal period. It is actually bleeding caused by withdrawal from the Pill's hormones.
TwoXChromosomes X That's fair enough.  I think most pro-choicers would be in total agreement.  I certainly would never want to see a woman giving up a wanted pregnancy because she felt she couldn't financially afford it.  And likewise, I would far rather women were spared unwanted pregnancies in the first place, than suffer the trauma of termination.
BabyBumps X It's probably a bit too early, but I would get the early response test with 2 of them in the box, take one tomorrow morning (with your first pee) and then if that comes up negative, take another one in about 2 more weeks. Hopefully you are pregnant! But also remember that a lot of times when trying to get pregnant, or even when not-- but when you think you may be pregnant sometimes people will psyche themselves out thinking they have all the symptoms.  Good luck! Keep us posted :) 
TwoXChromosomes X I was on depo for four years before I switched to an IUD (Mirena) and I had no complaints. My period stopped (as is common for people on Depo) and everything was fine.
BabyBumps X I had unprotected sex on and around  Nov 14, and tested ( a very slight) positive for pregnancy on  Nov 29, 3 days after my missed period. I'm now 6 weeks along. So it may be a wee bit early for you to test, but like you, I had a lot of symptoms that made me suspect that I was knocked up -fatigue was #1, along with screwy appetite (not nausea, just queasiness), bloating. Unlike you, I didn't have any spotting or period-like bleeding.  So... buy a few tests, like others here recommended, and pee on them first thing in the morning. And keep us posted! Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on Depo for two years. I didn't notice any bad side effects, although if you're used to estrogen BC for improved skin you'll miss out on it. I stopped menstruating about 4 months into Depo use, but it was kinda nice for awhile.   One thing to keep in mind though is that the FDA has a black-box warning on it and they don't recommend it for usage over 2 years since there is some correlation with bone loss. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think you misunderstood my point.  Personally, I believe life begins at conception.  However, I also understand that science hasn't got a definitive answer, and that's what we need to base laws on in this country.  I think that legally, we should be pushing for outlawing abortion past the point of medical viability (i.e., the point at which the child has a reasonable chance of survival outside the womb) with an exception only to save the life of the mother (50% viability is at about 24 weeks, or late in the second trimester.  By that time, questions of poverty, rape, incest, etc. should not still be an issue - 6 or 7 months is plenty of time to make a decision.) and nothing more.  Being pro-life to me is about so much more than abortion, and the subject has become so polarized that further debate is unlikely to bring about any change.  To be pro-life, I believe, is to focus on protecting and improving life by choosing to fight those battles which will make a real difference.  If the goal is to stop abortions, outlawing them completely won't do it; it would just drive women to back alleys, and then the babies AND the mothers would be dying.  Rather, if we want to stop abortions, we should fight the causes: poverty, lack of education about preventing pregnancy, lack of access to contraceptives, lack of support for parents (maternity/paternity leave, affordable childcare, etc.).  We should also be fighting more battles than abortion under the banner of protecting life: fighting for those who die from treatable or preventable illnesses because they can't afford and/or access healthcare.  Fighting to prevent deaths from war and abuse.  Fighting to end the death penalty.  Fighting to end poverty, hunger, malnutrition.    Fighting over the legality of abortion is at the bottom of my list of pro-life priorities not because I think the issue itself is unimportant, but because I think it's too important to waste our time on efforts that won't actually save any lives.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;The fact that the line is faint is not a good sign, the line should be a dark thick line  The control line should always be thick and dark, yes.  The test line depends how early you are testing.  You're not really supposed to test before 14DPO (when your period is due) but many women who are trying to conceive start testing up to a week earlier.  Which is crazy, as the most likely thing then is a false negative if you are pregnant.  But getting a weak line at 11DPO and a stronger one a day later would be quite normal and healthy.
TwoXChromosomes X I stopped having a period immediately on the Depo shot (I had very, very minor spotting towards the end of the first shot I'd gotten but never an actual period). Thus far, I haven't had any side effects except to say the absence of horrible periods altogether has made my life tremendously easier haha.
Parenting X , including one of the baby being restrained for the procedure.  That picture did worlds of good in convincing my ex.  Your husband will make 2 arguments, the cleanliness one, and the "other boys will make fun of him" argument.  My son is uncircumcised, and teaching him to clean his penis has been no more difficult than teaching him to clean his butt, or wash behind his ears.  For the making fun argument, see my comment above. Ask him: "Honey, how many times have you talked to your friends about the looks of their cocks?"  See my comments above about my own scarring from my circumcision.  Best of luck!
TwoXChromosomes X As far as I remember, sperm can be frozen as is, but eggs have to be stimulated out of the ovaries with hormone injections, and then fertilized, before freezing.
TwoXChromosomes X To be fair, the copper IUD is a pretty good option: effective, long-lasting, non-hormonal, and you never have to worry about it.    I think the biggest barrier to its adoption is people thinking that you've had to have had a kid to get an IUD, which is not true.  They recommend it more for people who have had kids since it's easier to insert, but child-free women can get it too.
TwoXChromosomes X because he was so large and I was over due.  He was still growing rapidly so they said once he was 10 days overdue they would induce.  NOTHING happened.  They sent me home and said we'll wait a few more days and hopefully it will happen naturally.  If not we will manually induce you (and that was all my cervix dilated).    ETA it was a good thing they got him out when they did.  Seems he was pooping in the amniotic fluid.. ewww
TwoXChromosomes X I would have to disagree, that isn't normally what happens. I think that most women do have trouble in the beginning nursing. It's why there are so many lactation consultants, groups, and nurses there to help women. A lot of babies just don't latch on that easily, some moms aren't holding the baby right, some babies don't latch on properly. Nursing is really hard, and I'm yet to meet a woman who has said the baby has just latched on from day 1 with no issues. It's painful and it takes a couple days or weeks, even months to get the hang of it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Look, whether you end up planning to give birth in the hospital or not, you have to give up the notion that how you give birth is related to how much of a woman you are. It will only end up hurting YOU. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think I've ever done it.  There's usually a box of tissue in the bathroom and barring that, a roll of paper towels under the sink.  
TwoXChromosomes X Having a C-Section or getting pain meds does not make you less of a woman. In fact I plan on delivering ONLY via scheduled C-Section. I am pretty sure the process will not take away any of my two X chromosomes.  That being said, you are the master of your own birth experience. Giving birth is a natural process, yet for centuries was one of the leading cause of death in women. Things can get hairy very quickly and it is always best to have a medical professional on hand (preferably in a facility that can handle any sort of medical emergency if needed). There are many hospitals that will accommodate a natural birth, please look into one of those. I personally know women who have done this. They stated their wishes not to be given drugs and no C-Section unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. It is your right to do so.   Finally, "pro-medicine" is not a bad thing.  
TwoXChromosomes X Not necessarily misinformed, just that I personally have done a lot of research on the subject and I don't understand how someone would want to have a c-section. That is terrifying to me. Even giving birth in a hospital is scary to a certain extent. Have you taken natural childbirth classes (not put on by a hospital) or read things that are pro-natural birth or just in favor of c-section, because I think that would definitely sway an opinion. (again, honest question, not accusatory.)
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, I also intend on becoming a doctor (premed now). Needless to say, I also know what I am talking about.   I do not agree and I found much of it to be a little too "airy fairy" for me. There was also some movie by Ricki Lake that I sat through. What I personally got from all of this was that suffering through the pain of childbirth is good for you and your baby and that if you don't you are a bad mother. There were also a lot of 'scare tactics' which I did not really appreciate. I seriously don't get why people want to throw away modern medicine because it isn't "natural". It boggles my mind.  I believe every woman has the right to her own birth experience be it natural or not. I would never presume to take that right away from any woman or badger any woman to make the same choice as me. 
TwoXChromosomes X I get a yeast infection EVERY TIME I get put on antibiotics. I was prescribed amoxycillin for my teeth last week and bam, yeast infection. I tried eating the probiotic yogurt...it didn't help.  Anyway, I take the pill! You take it right after you buy it (in my case, I went into the store bathroom right after I bought and took it there!) and it's gone in a couple of days. The little tube of cream helps. I can't remember what brand it is (I think it starts with a C), but it works every time. The ovules and junk are kinda messy and you're supposed to wait until you go to sleep so it doesn't all fall out.  Also lol at your username!
TwoXChromosomes X If you were already on the pill, you could skip your period by not taking the placebo pills and just jumping into the next pack, but if you're not on the pill now, I doubt it'll work to delay your period.  And you're really supposed to start taking the pill either on the first day of your period or the Sunday after the first day of your period.
TwoXChromosomes X Four things work for me: 1) Someone massaging my lower back. There are pressure points there that decrease the pain. 2) Heating pad. 3) Sex. If you feel too gross/tired for sex, just make yourself orgasm. That is enough to kick in the endorphins to help keep the pain away. 4) Lots and lots of Aleve.
TwoXChromosome X -topics/birth-control/birth-control-pill-4228.htm  &gt; Women used to be told that they could only start the pill on the first day of their period or on the first Sunday after the start of their period. We now know that its also perfectly fine to start the pill on any day of the month. Talk with your health care provider about what day is best for you to start taking the pill.  FYI :)
TwoXChromosomes X In American hospitals at least, a birth without pain meds and/or pitocin and/or c/s is quite rare. But the term "natural birth" means different things to different people to the point that I don't use it any more.
TwoXChromosomes X To be fair, the "pull out" method didn't cause pregnancy. Unprotected sex caused pregnancy. The "pull out" method is not actually good as contraception.
TwoXChromosomes X Use water or lube to practice with, especially if you're dry.  Removal - bear down and it'll push out easier.   Insertion - try different folding techniques - there are about 45 out there. Also different positions (I like one leg up, myself).   Also, it may seem weird that it takes *months* to adjust to - but that's because you're only using for a few days monthly.  Also, for what it's worth, I'm *tiny* so I promise that even little people can use a cup :)
TwoXChromosomes X No, it doesn't. A fetus depends on the mother for survival. You cannot imprison a woman and force her to be an incubator for the fetus. The rights of the fetus do not supercede those of the mother.
TwoXChromosomes X I love mine.  I never had increased cramping. You can leave them in for way longer than a tampon so you can reasonably wait 12 hours before emptying and it's really unlikely to be full.  I would usually change in the morning and before bed.  They take a bit of getting used to but I'll never go back to pads or tampons.
TwoXChromosomes X I am on continuous BC, so I skip the sugar pills in every pack to skip my period. Trishlovesdophins is correct though, you may get some spotting. It took 4 months for my body to adjust and not spot. But then again, I have a rebellious uterus ;)
TwoXChromosomes X I take Ortho-tricyclen Lo (so slightly different).  I tried to skip my period by doing that, too, but I ended up with a two-week long light period during that week, and then a regular period the next time I took the placebo pills.  Not so fun.  The hormone doses are different for each week, since it's a tri-phasic pill (as opposed to monophasic, with one hormone dose).    I've read on the internet before that you can postpone a period on a tri-phasic pill, but not completely skip it like with monophasic pills.  They say that after you finish the third week of pills in a pack, you can skip to the third week in your next pack, which is the same dose of hormones.  But, that means you basically waste a half pack of pills by not taking those first two weeks' worth of pills.  Also, I've never done this, so I can't tell you about personal experience.  I've also read that you're not protected against pregnancy during the week that you delay your period...  Of course, it's always best to talk about it with your doctor, too!
Parenting X Getting an IV for pitocin put in ;)   I woke up that morning feeling extra juicy and felt like there was a chance I might be leaking amniotic fluid so I called the dr and they told me that it didn't sound like I was leaking but I might be and that if I really wanted to go in to go ahead and go in. I really wanted Buger King so I went in. I was looking small for it being the day before my due date so they did an ultrasound, it showed low amnio fluid so they decided to go ahead and induce me. 
TwoXChromosomes X if your morning sickness is more than just morning sickness though, there are medications that you can be prescribed. but your OB will handle that. I started throwing up at 6 weeks with both of my pregnancies and didn't stop until the day my boys were born. 
TwoXChromosomes X Of course. But morning sickness in the first trimester is very normal. It did hit me again the last couple weeks, but not nearly as much like the first trimester. I did throw up though if she started moving a lot right after I had a big meal. 
TwoXChromosomes X hugs!  I'm so happy that you know what you want and have a supportive boyfriend! Abortion is a great choice if you know that you're not emotionally and financially stable to have a child. I'm just going to say this as the daughter of someone who chose to have several abortions. My mom chose to abort several times because she afford to raise them and provide them with the life she wanted her children to have. I know it's been really tough for her and she feels really guilty/repentant, but I'm really happy with the life we have now. There will always be those what if scenarios and I think that what gets to my mom. Just remember, that it's not your fault!   Oh, also, if you ever start a family, do not be too overbearing,overprotective, and over-babying the child! I think my mother was like this since she gave birth to me afterwards.
TwoXChromosomes X I just got a Diva cup and read the instructions (haven't used it during a period yet) and tried it out.  Noticed a lot of suction removing it, and noticed the 4 small holes that the instructions say you need to make sure are clear.    So, at least the Diva cup has it, and I don't know how often you have to clear it since I haven't used it yet.
TwoXChromosomes X I looked into the Implanon - I was concerned about scarring, and having it be more difficult to remove than an IUD.  Ultimately, you're probably better off with an IUD if you have a normally shaped and sized uterus.  As far as hormonal, long-term coverage goes, IUDs are more cost-effective as well, usually...
TwoXChromosomes X I have Paragard, and I love it. It hurt a bit going in, and the cramps/bleeding at period time are a little rough but not so bad that I can't function. I've had some pretty bad experiences with hormonal birth control, so this was a good alternative. Definitely something I would recommend if you can handle the cramps/bleeding.
TwoXChromosomes X I use Mirena, and I'd very much recommend it. Pills made me a lunatic, I'm allergic to latex, so it was pretty intimidating to actually get something put /in/ there, but I'm glad I did. It lasts five years, I've gone from terrible 7-day cramping periods to no periods at all, and I've never had any trouble with moodswings or crazyness like I did on pills.  Only thing is that it does hurt to get it put in. Think really bad period cramps... and it can last for up to three days. But if you've ever had bad cramps before, then all you need is a heating pad and hopefully three days to get used to it.  I've had mine for two years and I think it's totally worth it. Three days of bad cramps for five years without a period? Yes please. &gt;w&lt;
TwoXChromosomes X Mirena here! I've had it for two years and it is the best thing I've ever used.  I have that crazy tilted cervix, and it went in fine. I had a few cramps that day, but nothing major. I'm totally a worry wart, so it is nice to have the string. There is no poking or feeling anything in there, you actually forget about it.   No side effects for me, and the pill was horrible on my system, so the localized hormones seem to be ok.  I've had two kids and we aren't currently planning on having more.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks so much! I haven't missed a single one in 42 days, and have taken only the seven sugar pills and started the active ones the day after that, so that's right, yeah?
BabyBumps X I read online that your luteal phase (the time between ovulation and your period) has to be several days (I think 7-9 at least) in order for implantation to have enough time to happen. So if the only day you had unprotected sex was that close to the day your period usually starts... I don't know if it is possible for you to ovulate that late and still get pregnant. You probably ovulated a lot earlier in the month.   Did you ever take a pregnancy test?
TwoXChromosomes X I love New York and Company. I know, I know... Expensive. Well, do what I do... Outlet mall! I went to the NY&amp; Co in an outlet mall in Florida and spent $300. I got 3 new pairs of work pants, a bunch of sweaters and work shirts. Otherwise I love the Banana Republic outlet. I am a size 12/14 and I love both of these stores clothes! Hope this helps.
TwoXChromosomes X There's many awful ways you can die while pregnant or giving birth.  Did you know that being pregnant increases your risk of blood clots?  And did you know there's a rare disorder called peripartum cardiomyopathy where your heart spontaneously stops functioning after you give birth?  Just about anyone can hemorrhage during labor, or get eclampsia, or...  On a related note, you can also get hit by a car while crossing the street, some perfectly healthy joggers drop dead in the middle of an easy 5k, and you can get a parasite while swimming in a nice warm lake and die a few weeks later with little indication you were sick.  There's lots of "rare" ways to die that are not worth worrying about.  You're already hormonal and freaked out throughout your whole pregnancy.  Is it worth worrying about your less-than-four-in-a-million chance of dying from an epidural?  Bah.  I hate fear-mongering.
TwoXChromosomes X me too! but i think my boobs just got smaller. i've surprisingly lost a lot of weight this year. also went from a 9 to a 5 and a L to a M. yay me :) (this post was probably unnecessary but oh well)
TwoXChromosomes X A gyno not only inserts a speculum to get a good view and room for swabbing, but a gyno appointment may also include, but is not limited to: finger inside vagina, finger inside bum, breast exam. It involves lots and lots of physical contact. 
TwoXChromosomes X The difference between me and someone with multiple partners whom they don't know, is that I am smart enough to realize that I DON'T know whether or not that person practices safe sex behaviors, and I DON'T know how many people their sex partners have been with or if THEY practice safe sex behaviors, or their sex partners' sex partners have been with and their safe sex behaviors and so on, and I'm not stupid enough to trust that many people with my body. Because all it takes is for someone back down the line to have fucked up and for this one not to tell you about it, condom breaks, and you are fucked in every aspect of the word. I have NO reason to trust that every whore, slut, man-whore, or horn dog, is practicing safe sex, or that their partner's are, and therefore rather than put myself at risk, I just assume someone sleeping around is a dumb-ass who is not even thinking about all the people they are possibly sleeping with. Most of the time, I'm right, there are exceptions to every rule though. By the time you've slept with 12 different people, you have been exposed sexually to 4095 different people, and according to most recent HIV stats, 1 in 4 of those people don't know they have HIV, that's just your risks for HIV, that's nothing ELSE that's floating around out there. University of Rhode Island's College of Pharmacy put that information out. Pretty reliable source, but most sources will tell you generally the same thing. And condoms are most effective if used correctly, but not everyone knows how to use one correctly. All of this is not something I would just trust to anyone, I'm responsible for myself sexually and part of that is not sleeping around with a myriad of people I don't know a damn thing about.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm pretty sure he did an antibody test in his first round of blood work. It was a fairly standard test for him to run, but I will dig out my copy of the results and check. 
TwoXChromosomes X Is your view based on your own experiences, other experiences, research, a combination of these?  With all of the research I have done, in my city it is "safer" to birth at a birthing center than at the hospitals (e.g., there are much less interventions likely to be used like pitocin, c-section, etc.). The birthing center I am using is close to the hospital if there are any last minute complications that they midwives think would be better handled at the hospital. I'm not planning on a homebirth.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks! I edited my initial post to say that I was planning on birthing in a birth center, not planning on a home birth (although one of my best friends had a great home birth experience). I want to have a lot of experienced midwives helping me through the process.
TwoXChromosomes X I know it is webmd, but: -drinking-may-be-ok-during-labor This is similar to what I have read in almost every pregnancy book, regardless of how "progressive" or not it is.  Also, what happens when you don't eat and drink is that you don't have a lot of stamina for the labor process. That means you have to have something like Pitocin, and your contractions become faster and more intense...sometimes too fast and intense so that you have to have other drugs to slow them down. Then, because labor doesn't progress, you have to have more Pitocin. An awful cycle. But this is just what I have read or been told. I'm sure others have had Pitocin and and been fine with it.
BabyBumps X I was cold early in my pregnancy and am also on synthroid for thyroid issues. I'm sure you know this already, but pregnancy can mess with thyroid function, so it's good that you are monitoring your TSH levels! It seemed like they adjusted my dosage every month or two throughout.
TwoXChromosomes X I am very sorry for your loss and I wish you all the best in your continuation of trying to conceive. I know it can be a long process. Please realize that your friends getting pregnant have nothing to do with you. Be happy for them. 
TwoXChromosomes X Go talk to your doctor.  Tell her about the side effects you are experiencing and she can prescribe a different formulation of the pill, there are a LOT of different ones you can try.  However, some people can't tolerate hormonal birth control, it is possible you're one of them.    Make sure it is the birth control causing the problem, it could also be thyroid or mental health issues.    I have bipolar disorder and some formulations of the pill make it better, some worse, and some have no effect.  
TwoXChromosomes X yes, good call!!!   to the OP - this helps prevent urinary tract infections (uti) and bladder infections, because germs etc can get into your urethra during sex (so peeing helps flush out your system). 
TwoXChromosomes X It's hard to predict what they will do. There are hundreds of pills out there with different formulations and dosages.  They may prescribe a monophasic pill, or another tri-phasic with a different dose or chemistry.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm actually shocked to see so many people using pads at all.  Once I tried the Diva Cup in all it's genius I have never once wanted to strap a bloody wad of something to my vag and just throw away a ton of resources and labor every month.  Just in case you haven't heard of this magical, comfortable, reusable device: (here)[ ].  There are probably other brands or kinds, but this is the one I know about.  Please share others if you know of them.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you heard of Essure? If you are wanting this to be permanent it it might be a better option for you than iud's or tubal ligation.  
TwoXChromosomes X I used a cup with my IUD.  My gyno said just to be really careful about releasing the suction before pulling it out.  I never had a problem.
TwoXChromosomes X only in about 30% of women, and from what I read you probably won't see that happeneing until about 6mos after insertion.. thats 6mos too long for a trial. I stopped my period immediately with depo, the only downside is having to go back every few months for a shot
TwoXChromosomes X I have to second this. I had lots of sex with no orgasm. I also couldn't seem to even get myself off, which seemed very weird to me - I worried that I was broken or something was wrong with me. The first time I finally had an orgasm my husband (new boyfriend at the time!) went down on me and just stuck with it like a champ. Suddenly I felt the buildup and I actually said, "What are you doing to me??" and there it was. I was a bit drunk and relaxed and we had been fooling around for hours (it seemed like) and then he went down. And it still took forever. After that, I could only get off with oral (jaw breakingly long). But after awhile it got easier and easier. Now I routinely have two orgasms during sex (well, not sex alone - but if I get myself off once, I am much more likely to be able to have an orgasm from sex, in the right position. the second time.)
TwoXChromosomes X Condoms? FAM *with* condoms at all times? Diaphragm/ cervical cap with condoms?
TwoXChromosomes X It's totally different for everyone.  I'm 25 and have one child. She's 13 months old today.  We tried for 27 months to get pregnant so when we finally did it was like a weight had been lifted from our shoulders. Pregnancy for me was easy as pie. I am the exception to the rule, it would seem. I never got sick, I never got uncomfortable, and I lost weight. I felt healthier pregnant than I've ever felt in my life.  When I went into labor, I had no idea it was the real deal. I had read the stories about women being in labor for loooong periods of time before birth happened. I expected I would also be in this boat. My water started leaking at 5pm, we got to the hospital at 7ish... I was already 4cm dilated and had hardly felt anything.  Throughout the night contractions would come and go and I progressed really well. The pain with contractions varied greatly. Some of them I only noticed because I could feel my muscles tightening from the outside. Some of them made me cry/punch the bed.  At some point around 6am, they asked if I wanted to let them fully break my water. Seeing as I hadn't eaten in 14 hours, I quickly obliged.  Immediately after I went into transition, the contractions became almost unbearable. This was the only time I asked for an epidural, luckily my husband was there to remind me that it was almost over and I wouldn't be needing it. I got into the shower in my labor suite while my husband used the shower head to make figure eights on my back. Within 10 minutes I told them I needed to poop... but I didn't need to poop, I was crowning. They got me back to the bed to check me and I told them I needed to push, I just felt it... it was time. Because of how quick everything happened my doctor hadn't arrived yet. They asked me to wait to push, at which point I yelled "fuck no!" They ran to the hall to find a doctor. She came in and after 4 pushes and 7 minutes my daughter was born.  It was hard work and at the end it hurt... but it was nothing compared to gallstones or kidney stones.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I'm sick of going to the doctor every time I get one.  Ask *the doctor* what preventative steps you can take to ensure you get fewer - or no - infections. It really sucks going to the doctor so often, but the alternative is seriously messing up your ladybits using home remedies or douching. 
TwoXChromosomes X I used to get bacterial vaginosis every couple of months.  The first few times I had to take a pill version of Flagil.  The last time I had one I took the cream that gets inserted inside the vagina.  The doctor also recommended that I douche.  I douched a few times when I thought I was starting to get one again.  I haven't had one in a few years now.   I know that douching does change the pH, but I think you get them because your pH is not right. Also, I worked at a group home and one of my patients had the same problem.  Her doctor had her wash her vag with Cetaphil to prevent it, but as far as I know, she still got them occasionally. 
TwoXChromosomes X My little bit of advice? Even if you're super horny and ready to go, get him to GO SLOW for initial penetration - you don't want to tear anything because your body isn't accustomed to that kind of insertion. Lube, as was mentioned before, does really help, but going slow until you feel comfortable will help you feel good and hopefully help him last longer too. ;) 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't even get my period every month yet I still deal with the cramps. Its like phantom periods. 
TwoXChromosomes X I LOVED The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy. It was a good read, lighthearted and didn't freak me out. I found the What to Expect books to be a littler nerve wracking.  I do think it's important to have a weekly book though. It's fun to read whats happening that week!      My husband read a book by Kevin Nealon. I forgot the name of it--but it's a blue cover!    Congrats, Auntie! :)
TwoXChromosomes X you think permanent genital mutilation is more okay than waxing? at least the hair can grow back! more so it's not done on a newborn baby causing permanent rewiring of the brain. The people getting their daughters waxed may even think they're doing the right thing- how many pro circ people claim it should be done because it looks better or so that their boy can look the same as the other boys? Don't get me wrong.. waxing your daughter's peach fuzz is beyond disgusting.. but it's certainly not worse than the mutilation of a baby's genitals. 
TwoXChromosomes X This may be a new low in mansplaining. Most docs won't consider you "abnormally" irregular unless you miss more than 3 periods a year. Having them vary in length by anything less than a month or so is totally normal. 
BabyBumps X I've never heard of that one! Everyone told me I was having a boy because of the way I was carrying. Some people went as far as getting me unisex clothes at my baby shower because they were so sure I was having a boy. The ultrasound was right, and I did have a girl in the end :) 
TwoXChromosomes X How about: First day of vacation--Period starts. This is especially frustrating in my case because with the PCOS, I haven't had an actual period in at least 8 months.  So, I just sort of got into the habit of telling the gyn, "I don't remember, but that's not unusual."
TwoXChromosomes X never had a problem with it.  in fact, when i get a yeast infection, i buy the 1 day cream for the bf to put on his junk so he doesn't give the infection back to me.  they probably won't take the 1 day back--you will likely just have to buy another.  so just keep the 1 day.  it's not comfortable to use but certainly not painful.  the anti itch cream sometimes burns a little so i don't like to use it but the actual product has always worked fine and happily leaked gross goo all over my hastily purchased pads, underwear and sheets.  if that is the price i pay to not have an itchy crotch, so be it.  i do take an azo yeast once a day or eat an organic yogurt (brown cow is the best!) daily to try and prevent them.  i also switched to the diva cup.  i used to get them a lot and now, not so much.    after you do whatever you do (not the 7 day, it is such a pain!  they all work the same!) wash all sheets, panties and pants that you own--even ones you didn't think came into contact with your vagoo while you had the infection.  yeast is a tricksy little fungus.  if you had condomless sex with a dude, give him the 1 day cream and make him use it.  no sex/tampons for a week after the last treatment!
BabyBumps X I think the general rule of thumb is if you do the opposite of what you were doing and they stop, then it's false labor. For example, if you're laying down, get contractions and then stand up and they stop it's false. Another one real labor, contractions will always get closer together and more intense as time goes on. If you notice a consistent pattern to them, start timing them.   Of course, I also got contractions once for over 15 hours (not painful, but I could feel them) and they wouldn't stop no matter what I did, and then they stopped. I was 39 weeks pregnant though, and very disappointed. I hope your little bundle stays in there! 
TwoXChromosomes X If I stretch it out, I'll buy you a replacement. (That is also a good esxcuse for me to go shopping too.)   I have a lot of my own stuff, but I think I cant match with anything.
TwoXChromosomes X Thirded. Stress usually *delays* ovulation rather than making it earlier. It sounds like you might have had an annovulatory cycle. Was your early period particularly heavy?
TwoXChromosomes X No PMS, they last 5 days max, and occasionally I get cramps but I have prescribed pills for those, so WHOOO narcotics!
TwoXChromosomes X I hated it before getting on the pill - heavy, irregular, uncomfortable, sometimes made me sick. Now it's very manageable and I don't mind it at all.  But I totally agree with it being a good body check. My periods only got super uncomfortable for the several years that I was with someone who turned out not to be a good partner for me. I wonder if your body can tell you more than you realise... :|
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely talk to your doctor about it. As far as Im aware there is no reason to take breaks from the pill if you dont want to. But for me taking breaks helped me to get a baseline for what the pill was effective for and what other side effects it produced. I started the pill young too due to period pain, and found the breaks helpful to discover how time had changed my painful periods. I was very lucky and did grow out of my crippling period pain and have since stopped taking the pill. If I never tried myself off it, I would probably still be on it now.
TwoXChromosomes X You could easily have it. HPV is so easily spread because you don't need to have sex to spread it. It can be transferred by touch alone. According to this, I could be laying naked on top of my boyfriend and if our genitals are touching, and one of us has HPV, it *could* spread to the partner.   Go get yourself tested. If you are at college, most health centers should offer this service for frree or at least a smaller charge than a normal place. Or go to a planned parenthood.   HPV can never go away. It is a virus. Viruses cannot be killed as they are not living creatures like bacteria are, and they will never leave your body. Herpes is a virus. Chickenpox is a virus (actually a part of the herpes family) and if you had chickenpox as a kid, you still have that virus in you. The chances of it coming back are VERY slim, because your body has already reacted to that virus and knows how to defend against it in the future. HPV is a little different--there are TONS of strains of it, and even the Gardasil vaccine only protects against a handful (though they are apparently the most common). For some people, HPV may never actually *do* anything. Some strains can cause cervical cancer (YOU DO NOT WANT THAT) or warts (I think). It's really worth it to go get yourself tested and get the Gardasil vaccine. It cant make HPV go away if you already have it, but it can protect you from contracting any other strains of it. I'm really shocked your obgyn did not go over this with you. 
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely avoid paragard if you're not wanting to have cramps. It also is pretty painful to get put in, but it's completely worth not having to worry for the next 10 years.
TwoXChromosomes X There is no medical reason to get a PAP test in order to get hormonal birth control (esp. oral medication). You must get a blood test to check the coagulability of your blood, and of course a complete medical history must be taken from the patient but nothing more.  It makes no difference if you have an HPV infection or not, but at some occasions it does make difference in case of cervical malignancy (CIN2-3).  A sexually active woman, from the onset of her sexual activity and until menopause is recommended to have a PAP test once a year if no other findings are present. This is very helpful because if a woman is an HPV carrier and suddenly cervical warts appear, the doctor sees them early, treats them and the woman has really low chances of getting cervical cancer (which apparently is majorly related to HPV).  The wrong use of PAP tests is that many Ob/gyns use the results of a PAP test to diagnose a vulvovaginitis or a cervicitis of bacterial or fungal reasoning, which is not the indicated use of a PAP test. When you have any sort of inflammation you should go make a cultivation in a Microbiology lab.  Every 1 year in women from 18-50, every 2 years during the first years of menopause and then the tests can be stopped for good if there are no findings.
TwoXChromosomes X Just know that your experience probably won't be as awkward as my first time..  I went in because of pain during sex. My doctor was a middle aged MAN and about the same height as myself (5'4"). I was not happy that my primary care doctor set me up with a male gynaecologist for my first time.  So he went in with all his tools and whatnot. Obvisouly this hurt because I was in there because of pain! So I was just sitting there with this look on my face trying not to make noises or seem uncomfortable so that it wouldn't take any longer than it had to.  He told me before I left that I did a great job when he put in the speculum and that most people don't take it as well. Then he patted me on the back.   Ugh.. hahaha. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X when i was in transition from birth control pills to mirena my level of acne increased slightly while my body was getting used to the new hormone situation but it seemed to work its way out in a couple months, i also now dont get the monthly flare-ups
TwoXChromosomes X We call our Salvation Army "Sal's Boutique". I like G-Dubs for goodwill though.  Cute shoes for sure, not my style though - I don't think I could pull them off.
TwoXChromosomes X No idea. I had an abortion like 8 years ago, but never had a child to term or anything.  Basically the uterus size problem is why doctors generally don't want to give IUDs to women who have not had kids yet, because they have tighter/smaller   I don't want to be on hormonal birth control (was on the lowest dose pill and it ended up killing my libidio and making me mentally foggy) and turned out I can't get the IUD either. I'd like to get a tubal because I know I never want kids and would rather adopt, which is more in line with my ethics, but now I'm bracing myself for the kind of hassle I'm seeing described in these comment threads.  
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks for the input!  The reason I was put on NuvaRing is b/c it's the lowest dose of hormones in a birth control.  I have no problem having a period, I just can't deal with spotting.  I'll probably ask to go back to Loestrin 24Fe b/c my skin was so awesome while on it.  Every other birth control including Implanon makes my acne terrible!
TwoXChromosomes X At your age, unless having a family is a viable option for you in the next couple of years, I would suggest some form of hormonal birth control, or  IUD.  If you were a little older and your partner was very experienced and controlled with his body, I would suggest withdrawal as a possibility (maybe backed up with charting/natural family planning, and using a condom in the risky week).
TwoXChromosomes X The chances of you getting pregnant on the IUD is very slim, like EXTREMELY slim and it could just be some breakthrough bleeding for one reason or another. If you're worried though, I would suggest going to the doctor. A miscarriage (from what I've heard) is extremely heavy, you'll see a lot of clots, and depending on far along you are, you could possibly even see a tiny body/arm...etc.
TwoXChromosomes X Right, but the water helps to flush out bacteria and will make future pees hurt LESS. This might seem counter-intuitive but if you have frequent UTIs I can't imagine you haven't heard it before, it's sound medical advice.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never gone to a doctor with a UTI, and drinking tons of water always helped me. It may hurt to pee, but it hurts worse always feeling like you have to pee but nothing comes out, you know?
TwoXChromosomes X This practice is abhorrent and manipulative, and the people who advocate for it deserve to be punched in their self-righteous faces.  Taking advantage of people who are already in a fragile emotional state in order to advance your own agenda should be punishable by law.  Maybe if these same assholes were willing to provide birth control and PROPER sexual education, we'd see fewer unwanted pregnancies and then we wouldn't need as many abortions.  They, of course, don't care about that.  This is all about slut-shaming.  
TwoXChromosomes X Anyone who refers to an *embryo* (fertilization to 10th week of gestation, aka "the early weeks of pregnancy") as a woman's "baby" has an agenda to push.  As the article says, Human Life Services is "anti-abortion," not pro-women and not medically qualified.
TwoXChromosomes X Just as an FYI to you and twoX I used something called [cystex]( _v3) which has a mild pain reliever to help with the discomfort and a mild antibiotic to help stop the progression until you can get to the doctor.  
TwoXChromosomes X another option for de-periodification is oral BC - Seasonale is approved for 3-month continuous use, and other BC can be used continuously without ill effect too.  if the OP is interested in this option, he'll want to look into which pills have minimal anti-androgen effects - some like Yaz / Yasmin and Diane35 are specifically marketed as anti-androgens, which seems counterproductive in this case.  edit: i see others have suggested this, sorry for the repeat :)
TwoXChromosomes X This sounds like a bad yeast infection, sometimes one round of monistat is not enough, I'm surprised the doctors didn't reccomend anything.  Eat yogurt and take Sustinex, Culturelle, or some probiotic every day. Also take AZO for yeast symptoms and lastly get the 7 day or 2 of the 3 day treatments.  Also, your SO should take probiotics and eat yogurt evey day to keep from giving it back to you. Just my opinion, hope it helps. 
TwoXChromosomes X They lining doesn't need to get out unless you're ovulating. The pill stops you from ovulating.   The periods you have on the pill aren't natural periods anyway. They're caused by withdrawal from the hormones you were taking in the pill. The only reason they prescribe the pill in 28 day cycles is because they didn't think women would take it if they didn't. That's changing though. We're now seeing pills like Seasonal that you take continuously for 3 months straight so you only have 4 periods per year. Which is awesome IMO
TwoXChromosomes X *shrug*    I don't have Mirena. I have a copper, non-hormonal IUD. Hence, it has no impact on my periods. 
TwoXChromosomes X Paraguard! Mine was only $40 with insurance, but that was the office visit-my insurance covered the whole thing, woo! I got it because I wanted to be free of the hormones I'd been on for 10+ years, and so far it rocks. Had some minor cramping upon insertion, a bit of spotting, but that's about it. Haven't noticed a difference in sensations during sex and neither has the SO. Totally recommended!
TwoXChromosomes X Your cramps went away or your period? I'm guessing you mean cramps since only the mirena (hormonal) iud would stop periods.
TwoXChromosomes X STD/Is are incredibly common.  You've taken enough precautions, but sometimes these things happen.  You're not stupid, gross, or any less valuable as a sexual partner.  Most people will have this experience at some point in their lives, you are lucky to be able to access medical care for it!  There are so many strands of the herpes virus (I myself had a brief encounter with HPV that was rectified with surgery).  You may not have an outbreak for years at a time.  The important thing is that you know, so you can protect yourself and others.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes! The National Network of Abortion Funds is a great organization, and you can donate to it. 
TwoXChromosomes X No!  If you happen to get pregnant, it is entirely possible to bleed when the blastocyst implants in the endometrium.  It can go on for a couple of days, so if your periods are already pretty light, you can mistakenly believe that you've had your period when, actually, it was a sign you were pregnant.    That said, it is pretty light bleeding and the timing would have to be right. If your periods are usually like...a week of moderate bleeding, yeah, you're probably good.  
TwoXChromosomes X I loved OB because everything else leaked on me.  Thanks for the link. I have a diva cup size 1 - at the time, I had only heard of divacup and luna products. Now I'm pregnant with #1 and will probably need a new one after.  I started to think I needed a different one around when I hit 31 but whenever I was on birth control, it was fine. If it was off it, I would back up with a pad overnight. 
TwoXChromosomes X All that's left in my pack is iron pills.  I just wanted to make sure it wouldn't mess up the effectiveness of the next pack if I took pills while having my period.    Also, I've been taking the white pills all while bleeding (for three days now), will that mess things up?
TwoXChromosomes X It's possible that you don't get any form of PMS, but much more likely that you just don't recognize the changes in your personality due to hormonal shifts.  You don't have to have *crazy* mood swings to be affected by hormones and/or have PMS. 
TwoXChromosomes X I second everything you say. And I would like to add that when you go to the OBGYN, your doctor will typically talk to you and tell you everything she is going to do. Then, during the exam, my doctor tells me everything she's doing, if it will be a "soft touch" etc. She's very very comforting. I get nervous before I have to go, because quite frankly it IS uncomfortable. But I leave knowing I've been taken care of.  I also second that your post reads as a "I'm bucking the establishment by not going!" If you're having these problems, you seriously need an internal exam.   If you want someone to talk to a bit more, just PM me. I understand anxiety. I have it. I have anxiety over really stupid stuff, and this is NOT something stupid. It IS scary.
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm. I have gone through two stages of opinion on it, so I understand how you feel, despite feeling different now. For the first few years of having periods, I was really quite grossed out by it. Getting a bit on my fingers or something brought on an 'ew' reaction. However, when I started paying out myself for conventional menstrual products every month and switched to the Mooncup to save money, it became... less gross. Partly because when blood is all soaked into a pad or tampon, it stinks way more than just the blood itself for some reason, partly because I couldn't avoid the hands-on approach, but i'm really OK with it now. I'm not saying the Mooncup makes everyone suddenly not grossed out by Auntie Flo's visits, the different approach just made me a bit more OK with it...
TwoXChromosomes X That's actually exactly why mine suggested it to me, because I was having fairly heavy periods (going through several ultras a day for four days).  I hope that doesn't happen.  The Loestrin has worked really well for me so far.  This bleeding was just a user error, I hope.  D:
TwoXChromosomes X Its impossible to say without taking a pregnancy test. It could even be happening from missing pills and doubling up on them. Personally, I would wait a couple of days, and see if the bleeding turns into a more normal period, and then if not, take the test. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on Cerazette, just coming up to the end of the 6th month. I got spotting for the first couple months with my periods arriving two weeks after, and then it was two months before getting my next period but there was no spotting in that time, but spotting for the week after my period. Only other effect I got was my breasts got bigger..went from a 34B to a 36B after about 4 months of taking it.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm normal weight and had pretty heavy period when i wasnt yet on birth control. I needed longer pads to cover my butt crack and at the night pads that went all the way back to my tailbone(and still it leaked off the pad sometimes if i and the pad werent exacly in right position). For 2-3 days it was so heavy i had to change the pad on day time because it was soaking full. I quess i didnt think at the time that my period was particularly heavy tho and it isnt nearly as heavy as yours seems to be.    Then again my mother-in-law started to have really heavy periods when she was something like 35-40 for what i heard it was absolutely horrible, no pad nor tampon would help. She was then diagosed with myoma as the cause of her heavy bleeding.
TwoXChromosomes X Antibiotics block the absorption of your bc pills, so you are probably having breakthrough bleeding like if you missed several of your pills.  It's important to remember that you need to use a backup method if you have to take antibiotics!
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, definitely get a hormone panel done and while your at it, ask for a complete blood work up (all vitamin levels, iron, etc) and get your thyroid checked as well.  One thing to keep in mind is that if they don't have a "before" shot of what your normal hormone levels used to look like, the panel may come out looking "normal", but still not be normal for you.  Is there anything else in your life that could be causing this, increased stress, anxiety?  Any major life changes?  This sounds awful.  I'm so sorry you are going through this!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I accidentally took my Saturday pill on Friday and vice versa  This isn't a problem. With Yasmin, every active pill is the same.   &gt; I'm supposed to take it at 13:00 but sometimes it doesn't happen til 14 or 15 o'clock.  That much of a time difference doesn't matter. While taking it at exactly the same time is a great habit (I recommend setting a phone alarm), you're pretty much still safe as long as you take it within 12 hours of the right time.   I wouldn't be too worried about it. I start taking my inactive pills on a Saturday and get my period around midday on the Tuesday. Sometimes it can take a while. It sounds like you've been following the instructions pretty well so you should be fine, although if you're stressed I find it's always worth taking a test for your peace of mind.  You probably know this already, but it's very important to use backup protection if you go on antibiotics or if you have vomiting/bad diarrhea. That stuff actually can mess with your pill. Other than that, you're good to go.
TwoXChromosomes X I can feel the suction pulling down on my cervix.  I always wear at least a liner while it's in; on heavy days I wear a pad as well just in case of a leak.  I usually only leak during sleep, though.
TwoXChromosomes X I've heard that soaking a tampon in yogurt and shoving it up there does wonders. If you're prone to yeast infections though, maybe consider getting some probiotics? They come in pill form that you just need to take daily. Same stuff that's in yogurt.
BabyBumps X My hCG was 4308 at 5 weeks and and I just found out at 5 weeks 2 days, they jumped to 12,000! So happy for good news :)
TwoXChromosomes X i use cloth pads when i'm at home hanging out and/or sleeping and they are the best thing everrrr. so comfy it's like wearing nothing.
TwoXChromosomes X I was always pads over tampons. Sure, I would wear tampons if I went swimming, but I'm not crazy about the idea of jamming a wad of cotton up my yahoo.
TwoXChromosomes X My ex wife told me she tried to get her tubes tied in her early 20s, and was apparently refused.
TwoXChromosomes X Playtex gentle glides I found were the most comfortable to insert and wear, but I was a pad/tampon combo gal. I LOVED the Infinity pads! It's the magic of science between your legs.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not terribly grossed out by it. The only time I think it's gross is when I shed giant *chunks* of my uterine lining. Other than that its mostly just bloody and I don't have any sort of blood phobia. 
TwoXChromosomes X Herpes can still be contagious even though there are no visible lesions.  Near as I can tell, this kind of asymptomatic viral shedding is most common within the first few years of infection, and is at it's highest (asymptomatic) rate right before a lesion occurs.  Here's an older study from JAMA if you want to be a total virology nerd:  &gt;Brock BV, Selke S, Benedetti J, et al. Frequency of asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus in women with genital herpes. JAMA. 1990;263:418-420. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just recently had an IUD inserted, and they told me most places don't usually insert them for people who have not had children because there IS a higher chance of expulsion if you have not had kids.  Your uterus isn't used to having something there and is more likely to try and expel it.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not a doctor but I learned a little when a friend of mine just underwent exploratory laparoscopic surgery for something that sounds like similar symptoms. The surgeon found and removed a hemorrhagic cyst on or near her ovary. She's fine now and out of pain but it went for on a long time before it got to that point.  I would suggest you do your own research about your symptoms and perhaps you will learn a lot about endometriosis and different kinds of cysts. Being well informed will help you ask the right questions of your doctors and help you to be taken seriously. 
TwoXChromosomes X Get a second opinion from another doctor.  I went through something sort of similar, was having pain,(with heavy bleeding) and the doc was very dismissive about the pain.  The pain eventually got so bad I ended up in the emergency room where they did either an x-ray or ct scan (I don't really remember which).  They found a "blur" and ordered an ultrasound where they found a large fibroid the size of a grapefruit hanging out on my uterus.  
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, you can breastfeed in the middle of the display floor.  I would understand the owner saying if you (or your baby) stains it, you buy it, but I don't think that the owner is allowed to even ask you to move to a "more private area".
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; This means that even if we don't personally agree with a woman's reasons for abortion, if that's what she needs, we help her access those services. Even if we wouldn't have an abortion in her situation, we provide her with safe, affordable, medically sound treatment anyway. The job of the pro-choice movement, of abortion providers, is not to condemn or judge women for their reproductive health decisions. Our job is to support them, as best we can, and make sure that they can access the services they need.  This is said so perfectly. 
TwoXChromosomes X Once you get over your hangups and let go of the tension (which is often what causes the pain), it feels really good.  I also recommend lying on your back for less intense penetration and also so you can rub your clit to climax while he's going at it.  The orgasms tend to be really friggin' intense.
TwoXChromosomes X from your own link "Women who report having periods during an otherwise normal pregnancy are usually experiencing a phenomenon that is sometimes called decidual bleeding, in which a small part of the uterine lining might shed for the first few months of early pregnancy at the time that the woman would otherwise have had her period. Decidual bleeding is not a true menstrual period, but **it can look similar enough to cause women experiencing it to not realize that they are pregnant until fairly far along in the pregnancy.**"
TwoXChromosomes X Probiotic bacteria help to kill the yeast that grow in your vagina, so yes applying them vaginally would be optimum! Then they don't even have to go through your stomach and bloodstream as is the case with normal probiotic pills or yogurt. I wonder if we will get these in the US??
TwoXChromosomes X I have to disagree. That woman was clearly desperate, and willing to endanger her own life. I understand why people would disagree, but personally I still put more value on the life of a desperate adult woman than an unborn baby, however close to birth it is. 
TwoXChromosomes X Even if you do relapse, don't loose hope. Most smokers need several tries before successfully quitting. And in fact, the more you try, the easier it can be to quit.
TwoXChromosomes X hey there, Ive had the implant for 2 and a half years now and never had any issue with it for the first 2 years, I had no periods no weight gain and no pms, it was ace! Then suddenly my periods came back with a vengence :\ every other month I would have a pretty heavy period lasting around 3 weeks, so for the last 6 months Ive been having to cope with it as my regular doctor said that there was nothing that she could do...but I was so fed up with it! The doctor who put the implant in suggested I went on the pill to correct it, although it is too early to say seems to be working butnow there are so many hormones in me haha pms is rife and i feel like harming some people haha :)  The implant really is the only option for me, due to nothing working when Im on antibiotics!  Im not sure if this answered what you needed but feel free to ask me anything :)
TwoXChromosomes X Have you tried drinking the bejesus out of some cranberry juice when you feel one coming on? Helps a lot for me, and probably a bunch of women on here...
BabyBumps X I started feeling movement around 14-15 weeks (don't remember exactly). I remember thinking that it was a lot earlier than everyone said was possible, especially since it's my first baby. At first it felt like tiny little muscle twitches with an occasional popping feeling. The movements kept getting stronger and now I'm sure that I had been feeling the baby at that point.   I think the reasons I could feel movement so early were that I have a lot of down time during the days and since the movements are so little you really have to be almost completely still in order to feel them. I also found out after going through my medical records that I have a posterior placenta (which means the placenta is at the back of my uterus so the baby's kicks can be more easily felt). I'm pretty sure that I could externally see occasional movements by 16-18 weeks, but I don't remember exactly.  Now I'm about 31 weeks and I'm constantly getting jabbed in the side and it's really starting to hurt. I can still sleep on my stomach though, oddly enough.
TwoXChromosomes X Congrats!! I quit December 2008, and  I know how hard it is, the patch really helped a lot with the nicotine withdrawals. 
BabyBumps X I felt it at about 17-18 weeks. Usually they said anything that you feel before 14/15 weeks is gas air? But who knows. You'll be feeling your baby plenty soon enough! 
BabyBumps X I think this is pretty well known. Especially if you aren't effaced or dilated at all, you are extremely likely. Your baby just isn't ready to come out, so neither is your body. The pitocin is trying to force labor on you, but when baby isn't ready it can cause a drop in fetal heartbeat (and when that happens, they tend to give a c-section), or mom will just not dilate, because her body just isn't prepared yet for the big day, so a c-section is in order once again.
TwoXChromosomes X I did not mean that rape should be considered at the at the same level as Assault and Battery, I said that it should be constrained at the same level. Punishment would be different because they're different crimes, but the definition would be constrained to a specific event happening. 
TwoXChromosomes X My guess is they'll suggest birthcontrol (which is used to manage functional cysts). If the cysts are larger than 5cm they may recommend surgery. (I've had 2 such surgeries myself) Otherwise, they may just keep an eye on them.   My right ovary has been cystic since I was 12-13 (when I had my first surgery). The cysts continued for the 5-6 years (13-19ish) I was on birthcontrol, so I suppose the effectiveness of this treatment is different for everyone.  My pattern has gone like this for 14 years:    * Cyst ruptures (full or partial)  * Cyst regroups or a new one forms  * Cyst grows for 6 months  * Repeat from top  They are always symptomatic, so I know what each one is up to based on frequency and severity of symptoms [read: pain].  I'm really glad you followed up. Cysts are easily detectable in a physical exam so you have every reason to express your frustrations to your gyno before finding another. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me!
TwoXChromosomes X The four or five days after your period ends bleeding sounds like it could be ovulatory bleeding. Or your cycle could be changing and it's just some irregularity. That happened one time to me. I finished my period on the 14th, then on the 19th some spotting and then for 4 months after that my period started on the 19th, it was kind weird.
TwoXChromosomes X Contraceptive gels and foams are effective when combined with other forms of birth control.  While the rhythm and pull-out methods of birth control aren't exactly that reliable, they can be used to at least improve your chances against an unwanted pregnancy.  If you want to go with a more long-term solution, an IUD is another option.
TwoXChromosomes X I have problems ordering from US sites (I've drooled over some of those listed below), but allsaints.com (especially their vintage section) has become my online shopping love over the past year. 
TwoXChromosomes X Look into Mirena.  Also, have you tried a different kind of pill? I can't take any pills that have estrogen in them, they make me insane. But progesterone pills work relatively well.
TwoXChromosomes X I used those strips when I was trying to get pregnant. They worked. I had negative test one month and many many positives the next even though I had period type bleeding - I was pregnant! If I had known, I would have bought them when I was avoiding pregnancy too.  I heard that they cannot be falsely positive just false negative. See this : 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, IMO if an orgasm is something you can have anytime you want to, then it becomes less important to have one every time you have sex with a partner, and you can enjoy sex for its own sake. Orgasms shouldn't be a scarce resource!
TwoXChromosomes X A couple of things based on what you've said in your main post and comments: If you want to use natural bc try the Fertility Awareness Method. this is NOT standard days or the rhythm method!!!! That's very important!! Fertility Awareness (FAM) is based on waking (basal) body temperature and cervical fluid (not arousal fluid, there's a difference.)  the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility is a great resource on FAM. However, it's usually not recommended to use FAM if you have just gone off hormonal bc because your periods are not regular yet. But you can still start charting your cycles and use FAM for bc when your cycles become regular.  The ladycomp uses Basal Body temp, it's just a fancy thermometer. I honestly wouldn't use it. You can just use a regular walgreens thermometer.  Also, I would reconsider the paragard IUD. The risk of accidental sterilization is very VERY low. (I think someone else posted it's about .0074%) It's really a great option (I hope to get it soon)  I hope this helps, good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Birth control differs drastically from person to person. One person may love one form, or one pill, while the next person might have had terrible side effects. I personally feel that the IUD tends to have better reviews from people overall. It's 30 seconds of being uncomfortable for 5 or 10 years of protection. I got my Mirena inserted 3 months ago and am a huge fan. The pill you do have to remember everyday, which is why I prefer BCs such as the [Nuvaring]( ), Implanon that you mentioned, or the IUD. 
TwoXChromosomes X For what it's worth, I tried doing this and ended up with the complete opposite result. Instead of skipping a period, my period came and hasn't stopped for 4 months, even though I've switched to using it "regular." I don't think this is a normal reaction, but it may be something to keep in mind.
TwoXChromosomes X Both practices are genital mutilation. Regardless of purpose, or tradition - it's disgusting.
BabyBumps X 15 weeks. I wasn't sure that I was feeling the baby and not some weird form of gas bubbles until 18 weeks when the kicks became consistent and harder, but it was 15 week.
TwoXChromosomes X I understand. It's just that usually when people are referring to female circumcision they mean the genital mutilation part where they remove the clitoris and in my understanding thats the most common way it's done.     Male circumcision doesn't usually affect the ability to orgasm, considering that most women cannot orgasm without doing something to their clitoris, if it gets removed..    But I'm not for either male nor female circumcision. Both are just unnecessary if not for medical reasons, and harmful..
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;the intention has always been to inhibit sexual function.  Read the cited WHO document:  &gt;*There is substantial evidence that male circumci- sion protects against several diseases, including urinary tract infections, syphilis, chancroid and inva- sive penile cancer, as well as HIV. However, as with any surgical procedure, there are risks involved.*  I'm against genital mutilation, uncut and male FWIW.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Too snotlike or runny egglike.  i don't know why, but for some reason i find snot to be 1000x more repulsive than spit, piss, puke, semen, any bodily fluid.....i could never figure out why, wonder if i'm alone in that :/
TwoXChromosomes X You went into labor on your own though at full term, meaning your baby was letting you know "hey I'm ready to come out now!" No doctor was evacuating them. 
TwoXChromosomes X Not really: I would oppose, say, the removal of the earlobes if that were legal. However, the loss of sexual function makes it especially cruel, and so more important.
TwoXChromosomes X And... how does that have *anything* to do with this topic.. **at all**?  Because if you *think* you're referring to this:  &gt;Both practices are genital mutilation. Regardless of purpose, or tradition - it's disgusting.  Hate to break it to you.. you completely missed jonuggs' point.
TwoXChromosomes X Every 12 hours (part of the reason it is so awesome). When I bought the cup, it said you should buy a new one every year but several women have told me that is a conservative suggestion and it can last up to 10 years. A new one costs around $30 and is much cheaper in the long run than the traditional tampon or pad route (even if you do replace it every year).   Edit: noticed you are asking a different question. My bad. The cup holds quite a bit of fluid. That said, on heavy days, you could change it every 6 or 8 hours until you are more familiar with how quickly it fills up. This isn't a problem for most users and the 12 hour rule is fine.
TwoXChromosomes X No. It's *withdrawal* bleeding and sloughing. You aren't going through a menstrual cycle and menstruating as normal. Your body is kept in a constant state of hormones, with your body tricked into thinking it is pregnant, except for the week off. [It is not a "normal" period.]( _myths_misconceptions.htm) Read the article, it'll help clear you up a little.
TwoXChromosomes X If you start missing them entirely then you've a problem. If you're a bit late, don't freak out. And as always if you're worried, pee on a stick.
TwoXChromosomes X Oh, and I'm fine and happy with your mother's choice. Like I said, I'm always very glad to hear about stuff like that. I'm not advocating against ever keeping preemies alive, or anything crazy like that.   I just would not personally be able to make that choice, because of the strong possibility of lifelong complications. Kind of like not carrying a fetus to term if it might have a disease or something. I respect the people who can face that. I wouldn't try to stop them, not at all. *I* just couldn't. It's kind of like... people who are pro-choice but couldn't get an abortion because they think of their pregnancies as babies. I'm glad there is technology like that, but much as I wouldn't want to be kept on life support forever, it is not something I would do.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, the peeing is pretty constant, especially at night.  Being emotional and bitchy even not during my period. Then today I started bleeding randomly. I can't take naproxen because it makes me really sick to my stomach. Lately the only thing that is helping is percocet.   My ovaries hurt pretty often, but my lower back hurts ALL THE EFFING TIME. Lap is in 12 days. Ugh!   But thank you!
TwoXChromosomes X The hormone that causes a positive test, is the same hormone that causes pregnancy symptoms. So, if you experience symptoms, you should be able to get an accurate test.  I was able to test positive at 3 weeks with both of my pregnancies, but everyone is different.   Edited to add that I found the cheaper pregnancies (drug store brands) gave a positive earlier then the brand name tests.
TwoXChromosomes X You might be way off-balance down below, I had similar symptoms after a successfully treated yeast infection.  It took a round of estrogen cream (after 2 months of waiting - wow that was dumb) to get me good as new.  See a gynecologist. 
TwoXChromosomes X I use the diva cup and it has ridges around the bottom that make is easier to hold on to.  Also, if you must empty it in a public restroom I find that wiping it with a tissue before reinserting it is more than sufficient.  There is no need to hop around with your pants around your ankles.  One thing though.  I have found there is a definite learning curve in using it.  It may take a bit to find the best way to insert and position it, but do not lose hope.  It is totally worth it and is a liberating method that allows me to forget that I am even on my period half the time.
TwoXChromosomes X Getting put on the pill, constant exercise, heating pad on the cramp, Midol....I had a ton of remedies but these seemed to be the ones that worked for me!
TwoXChromosomes X More resistant strains of UTI are forming and if a UTI gets really bad it can spread up into your kidneys and into your blood stream, so see a doctor asap.  Cranberry juice only prevents UTI's, it does *not* cure them. I found it will sometimes alleviate the pain. If you don't wanna drink cranberry juice get a cranberry supplement. I take them everyday regardless of UTI or not.  Also, drinking a shit ton of water really helps but again, it does not cure the UTI. 
TwoXChromosomes X Pelvic exam isn't so bad. It's a couple minutes of uncomfortableness that make sure that you don't have cervical cancer. Not a bad deal. Ask them if they heat the speculums - that can make the experience slightly less uncomfortable :)  And your parents do WHAT? :\  Can you get in touch with the office that issues these cards and report yours lost or stolen?  Then you can have one of your own sent to you, maybe. 
TwoXChromosomes X While pantyliners do make great backup for tampons, I'm not going to wear them all month long in case my period decides to show up. I find them uncomfortable and restrictive, so I think I'll just deal with the blood stains and pass. 
TwoXChromosomes X Question... The pamphlet said that I should rotate the cup a full 360 once I get it inserted, but I couldn't get a good enough grip on it to do so.  It *seemed* like it'd created a seal, but that is just my guess, since I didn't really know what to feel for.  How can you tell when you have a good seal, and how the hell do you rotate that thing?  My gyno says that I have fairly small, uh, lady-insides, so maybe that's my problem.  The cup fit comfortably and I didn't have any issues with the stem being pokey, so that's not a big deal.
TwoXChromosomes X In school we learned that there used to be a kind of tampon that was super heavy flow and could be left in for days or even your whole period.  They were so absorbent that they actually dried out your vagina and led to irritation and small cuts inside. The combination of the days old menstrual blood growing bacteria and a way to enter the blood stream = high likelihood of TSS
TwoXChromosomes X The FDA decided in 2005 that one doesn't need to have given birth in order to have an IUD.  Since you're in Canada, and they are sort of, you know, better than us at health, you will probably not have trouble finding a nice, modern, women's clinic where you can get one.  Often, they will prescribe misoprostol (cytotek) to made the cervix a little easier to dilate, but it's by no means necessary.  These are the requirement and contraindications, as per the World Health Org: uterus must measure between 6 and 9 cm, have started your periods, and are not immediately post partum, and you don't have a bicorunate uterus.  For the copper IUDs, you shouldn't if you have Wilson's disease.  For the levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs, there are more contraindications due to the progestin analog.  Check out the LJ community [IUD_Divas]( _divas/).  There are a good number of Canadian's who frequent it, and by browsing the tags you might find a reference for a clinic near you.  Also an abundance of personal experiences from real women who've had/currently own an IUD, for better or worse.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, this is my second question.  For me I see a full bell-curve.  Miscarriage occurs to 1 in 3 during the first trimester (citation needed, but when we had 2 miscarriages; Doctors readily provided it); so I would see an abortion during the first trimester as a "Human induced miscarriage"  However, a D&amp;C is really a horrible operation and I could see it as tantamount to murder; but possibly murder in self-defense; but with a trial required and everything to determine guilt.  So I see abortions as a sliding scale as well.  Hard for me to view "Rape" as OK and "Abortions" as evil, or to view "Rape" as evil and "Abortions" as ok.  So much of it depends on the situation.
TwoXChromosomes X Not an American, so I can't help you, sorry, but I can't *believe* they refused to give you a pap smear. I had always heard that you should get one within three years of becoming sexually active. I've just googled "First pap smear" and came across [this article]( ) which says,  &gt;In 2009, guidelines were changed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Updated guidelines suggest that women should have their first Pap smear at age 21. The old guidelines recommended women have their first Pap three years after become sexually active or at age 21 -- whichever came first. If you are well over the age of 21 and have never been screened, know that it is never too late to have your first Pap smear.   which probably explains why they're being dicks to you.   I wish you luck in getting an IUD and the healthcare that you need. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I actually talked to my GYN about this a month or two ago: progesterone pills must be taken *literally* at the exact same time every day. Not like the few hour window you can use with estrogen/estradiol pills. Apparently this is because progesterone pills (Jolivette) only stop ovulation, they don't stop maturation of an ovum the way estrogen pills do. So, if you're even a little late (like more than 1-10 minutes) taking the pill, you could technically ovulate. Hope your doctor talked to you about all this. :l
TwoXChromosomes X the pelvic exam is more awkward than painful. just relax so that your muscles aren't tense.  as for the birth control, every woman reacts differently. do you know what kind of birth control you are going to get? (Progestogen-only pill, combined pill, low dose or high dose pill) I've been on Aviane and Lutera, two low-dose pills, and I've never gained weight or gotten crazy because of it. I may have broken out when I first got on the pill (body was adjusting to it) but then again, I also was breaking out so terribly before getting on the pill and afterward my skin mellowed out
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, it's definitely important to have a good relationship with your doctor. *Especially* your gyno. Sounds like time to shop around. Good luck! I really recommend you check out the NuvaRing. Since it stays in for 3 weeks, you don't have to remember to take a pill at the same time every day, so the hormone levels stay consistent. I've found this helps prevent breakthrough bleeding, etc.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had to have surgery for it twice. They switched my bcp about 9 times in 5 years and just kept saying my body was becoming complacent with the meds. After 5 years and a few doctors I finally had one who did a sonohysterogram and they found the polyps. They weren't visible via internal ultrasound because of the uterus position.   So I had surgery to remove them. It was so quick and easy.   Three years later same thing happened though- I had another sonohysterogram found that I had scar tissue that had caused my uterus to sorta grow together in spots so they went in to repair that and while in there found a polyp.   Apparently my body likes to make polyps.   I hope for you that it isn't that either- but just be persistent with doctors because it took me 5 years to get an answer to my weird bleeding.  I do BBT/FAM now so I know when I should have any extra spotting for ovulation or whatever.   Good Luck.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Either you think the fetus is a living human and are pro life, or you don't and are pro choice.    Nope, I believe a fetus becomes human fairly early on in a pregnancy, but I believe abortions should be legal right up until birth. Ultimately, I believe that a person's right to body autonomy supercedes any other person's right to their body.  If the person in question happens to be a fetus who will die if they are not given shelter in a uterus, that does not make their mother required to share her body with them.      Once the fetus is viable, one could argue that the baby should be delivered, not aborted.  At some level, I do agree.  However, the line for viable is very blurry.  Clearly, at 8.5 months, a healthy fetus is viable, and will suffer little or no long-term health issues from being delivered early.  However, babies delivered earlier in the pregnancy have increasingly large odds of being born with severe health issues.  While some babies have survived being born less than 5 months into their gestational period, all of them have severe ongoing health issues, and the vast majority do not survive.  While aborting a 5 month old fetus is certainly morally murky,  delivering a fetus who has a 98% chance of dying a slow, painful death may be even more unethical.  I support a woman's right to evacuate her uterus as she chooses, and I leave it up to her and her consulting physician to decide whether it is morally better under the circumstances to deliver a baby into suffering, or to perform a mercy killing (and yes, I do support legal euthanasia for adults and children as well).
TwoXChromosomes X Well when she does the exam, I believe she checks for them. When she's like, pushing on your ovary and pushing up from inside my vag, I think that's what she's doing. I've never liked my gyno, however. My Mom has been going to her for years (one of the things that makes me uncomfortable) and she said that she used to be a really good doctor when she had a partner but then her partner had to stop because of money or insurance reasons or something and now my doctor is constantly in a hurry. Worries me slightly.
TwoXChromosomes X We shouldn't judge women for having multiple abortions, and there should be no limits on that.   That said, I think if a woman is having abortions repeatedly, there are some other problems going on. No one should really need to do that, if only for the fact that it's not cost effective at all compared to other methods of contraception.  Abortion *is* a method of birth control, by the way.
TwoXChromosomes X Why do you still have antibiotics left over? You know that if you don't finish them, you might not be completely killing the infection, right? You leave a residual amount of the bacteria in your system, and the disease comes back stronger than before. That would lead to multiple UTIs fairly quickly.  Come on, girl. Go to the doctor before this spreads into your bladder. It'll be far worse than a catheter if it does. And finish your antibiotics, or don't take them at all. (Really, though, you need to get over the antibiotic thing). With your history, though, a trip to the Urologist wouldn't be such a bad idea. Sounds kidney related. 
TwoXChromosomes X For some reason no one has mentioned the fact that multiple abortions lead to infertility. One abortion can lead to infertility if it isn't done exactly right. One's goal in life should not be to have an abortion or 7. It should be to not get pregnant in the first place until they are ready. Sometimes, accidents happen and you have to have an abortion. But there are still consequences. 
TwoXChromosomes X Instead of cranberry pills, try [D-Mannose]( _mannose_wcranactin_1000mg.htm?fromsrch=d-mannose).  I used to get UTI's my whole life till I found this. Would take antibiotics, finish the course, and it'd be back in a few days. Now I haven't had one in 2 years. It's a freakin miracle. I take the pills when I feel a UTI coming on. Or take 2 capsules every few hours for a day or two, and it clears up. Amazing, amazing, wonderful stuff.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for 5 years.  IMO, it's much safer than Mirena because there's no hormones (I smoke).  Plus mine's still good for another 7 years.  I love it.  My periods haven't been any heavier from it.  I've always had **bad** cramps, so I don't know if it's worse in that department.
TwoXChromosomes X She seems fairly knowledgeable re contraceptives, and wants to go with the pill. I used to use condoms with my SO, now I have an implant since we didn't want to use condoms.
TwoXChromosomes X It's a 12 hour window. The most dangerous tablets to miss are the ones either side of the white tablets (if you take the white tablets), as this extends the time you are not covered by hormones.  EDIT: Also if you have diarrhea or vomiting at all, count that day as a missed pill. EDIT: spelling
TwoXChromosomes X I got one 2 months ago, so I'm still in the baby stages of getting used to it.  Before the IUD, I would have one or two really crampy periods a year, but for the most part, advil was fine.  Now, I cramp randomly, but not really painfully either, just more of an annoying twinge. My periods are lighter, not heavier, since now I spot for weeks. I'm all excited at the moment because I haven't spotted in 3 days. Really.  From what I understand, this gets better after 4-6 months or so.  I do have to say that if I COULD take hormones, I'd get the Mirena. But I'm very, very glad the paraguard exists, compared to being stuck with condoms forever, the side effects are well worth it.
BabyBumps X Ahh that's soo amazing! In a couple more weeks no one will even have to touch your belly to feel the baby move, your entire stomach will start moving in circles! 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for almost a year now. I never cramped very much and I definitely do now, but after about 4 months it lightened up and is totally manageable with an Aleve. I do have heavier periods, but it hasn't really been a problem so far. I lead off with the negative because every other part of it is amazing. No hormones, as effective as the pill, effortless, lasts 10 years, cheaper than birth control--AND I can have incredible, spontaneous sex any time I want. I LOVE it.   
TwoXChromosomes X I would argue that it's a potential life when meiosis has created an ostensibly viable blastocyst.  Which can be detected by pre-implantation diagnosis, if IVF is being used.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to determine whether it was a potential life or not until a CVS became possible several weeks later.  I personally don't regard a fully anencephalic pregnancy, even though it can be born full term, as a "life".    
TwoXChromosomes X Yeast Infection was my first thought. Be sure that they are not recurring. Soreness and being easily irritated are my main symptoms.   Hope you figure it all out. It sucks trying to deal with that kind of pain. Warm baths might provide some relief in the meantime.
TwoXChromosomes X Thats what this bill is trying to make it into, instead of as an essentially parasitic (by definition, not connotation) mass of cells that would not be living were it not for you living first.  Your existence is not necessarily prerequisite for another adult person to be alive, therefore there is no similarity at the most base level.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't want to hear any bullshit from anybody arguing that a sonogram is uninvasive.  There are types of sonograms.  The texas bill is modeled after one from Oklahoma in which they wanted to force women to have a _cervical_ sonogram.  That's a probe that's forced against or through the cervix in order to get a clearer view of the fetus (and thus exposes it and the woman to more radiation), and is very painful to the woman, and obviously very, very intrusive.
TwoXChromosomes X limiting access to abortion and limiting their controll over their bodies and reproductive rights
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Patrick said his bill is a "clarification" of a bill that passed the Senate last session. "My intent has never been to force a woman to view the sonogram or hear the heartbeat if she chose not to," he said. "In my view, it was very clear in the other bill, but to make sure it was clear, we simply took out the phrase 'avert the eyes' and replaced it with 'she can choose to view or not to view.'"  Plus, you have to have the sonogram anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think you had an orgasm.    I think you got "really close" each time. The hotness, back arching, etc. happens before an orgasm. The actual orgasm, is like...a release of the hotness.     You wouldn't "think" you had one, you'd know.  
TwoXChromosomes X Pro-tip: when you get on antibiotics go to the drug store and get a bottle of acidophilus. Its like $4 for the generic version and it'll last you more than one prescription's worth. Take it once a day when you take your meds and drink more cranberry juice. I get really bad sinus infections about once a year and have to go on killer doses of antibiotics to get rid of them and once I started doing this I never got a yeast infection from it again. Better to prevent the yeast infection from the get go :)
TwoXChromosomes X Then you are extremely lucky. The weight gain and inability to lose weight are two of the biggest symptoms of PCOS.     I have weight problems, had cysts bad enough that I had to have one ovary removed for a grapefruit-sized cyst that killed it when I was 20 and a complete hysterectomy at 26, and insulin resistance so high my body doesn't even make insulin anymore because it *wore out*. On the other hand, I don't have skin tags or horrible acne. That's why it's a 'syndrome'. It's a collection of symptoms. Not everyone has all of the symptoms.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah I guess that's the thing: the "fetus" issue. My opinion: When it's a bunch of cells, it's not a fetus yet. it's an embryo. it's a zygote. not a fetus. and, besides, fetus=/=baby. So that's why I think that cashew cluster of cells doesn't have a "right to life" until probably the third trimester. When that thing is viable outside the womb: you got yourself a baby. Up until then, it's a parasite. It's a cluster of cells. Not a human life. That's how I see it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Viability happens in the 2nd trimester, you know.  It's currently 24 weeks, and some babies have survived at 22 weeks.  Some babies are born alive and can stay alive for a little while (minutes and hours) even younger than that.  A fetus is easily recognized as human at 12 weeks (end of the 1st trimester), and the dividing line for miscarriage/stillbirth in the medical community is 20 weeks.    Also, "fetus" is the term used for a full-term baby, too, not just a "young" one.  And my point is just that it's complicated to try and decide when it becomes "human" if you don't think it starts that way.  
TwoXChromosomes X That's a whole other can of worms... I don't have a good answer.  I think regardless of the legality question, our focus ought to be on proper sex education, promoting birth control, and providing financial support to women who can't afford their pregnancies.  Those will all do a better job of reducing abortions - which is the real goal - than making it illegal, IMO.  But just so I don't wuss out of your question:  If I was voting on a bill right now, yes, I guess would vote to make it illegal.  Close call though.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;When that thing is viable outside the womb: you got yourself a baby. Up until then, it's a parasite.  Are you saying that the sole difference between a parasite or some "bunch of cells" and a human being that is deserving of rights is whether or not it is dependent on another human? That's... it? Nothing at all even to do with brain development? Whether it can think or feel?  Also, does someone's right to life disappear if sometime later in life they become dependent on others for life? If not, why is that? What's the difference in that scenario?
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I know what you mean. If they want to restrict abortion access, they should increase access to birth control, contraception, and sex education. Then that would make a little more sense (even though I still disagree with restricting access to abortion--I think that, by restricting it, they are opening doors to more dangerous illegal procedures), but unfortunately, that's not really what we've been seeing. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I didn't say anything about comfort or happiness.  By this I meant that in the cases where I don't support abortion, the mother's *life* is not on the line.  Only her comfort/happiness/general desire not to carry the baby.  To me, that's not enough to trump the fetus's right to life.  &gt; the fact remains that outlawing abortion doesn't stop it from happening. It only stops safe abortions from happening to women that can't afford to pay a good doctor to break the law. Making abortion illegal doesn't suddenly make all women have a change of heart about having one. It causes them to do dangerous and possibly stupid things out of desperation.  Absolutely true.  As I mentioned in a different post, the question of how to handle this legally is a whole separate can of worms.  The fact that some - not *all*, but some - women who wanted abortions will go the dangerous, back-alley route is certainly an argument against straight up illegalization.  I don't have a solution personally, but I don't think things are okay as-is either.  It's an ongoing discussion, for those of us who think abortion is wrong, about what the next step ought to be. 
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm, interesting. I think I'm pro-choice up to the point where the child could survive on its own outside the womb without ridiculous levels of medical intervention/likely long term damage. Probably up to about the start of the third trimester. After that I'm only really pro-choice if the child is severely disabled and is likely to die anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks! :)  And thanks for the link, it was interesting.  Also just to be clear:  &gt; do not believe that aborting an early term fetus is equivalent to taking the life of a person  I don't think it's *equivalent* - I do value the mother's life over the fetuses by a very large margin.
TwoXChromosomes X Consciousness is hard to define. The entirety of our thought processes, and thus our personality and our humanity, occurs in our brains. We have no reason to believe it is anything other than the physical neural connections being made in our brain. The completely vital part of humanity is a working brain.  When medical ethicist Bonnie Steinbock was interviewed by Newsweek and asked the question "So when does life begin?," she answered:  &gt;If were talking about life in the biological sense, eggs are alive, sperm are alive. Cancer tumors are alive. For me, what matters is this: When does it have the moral status of a human being? When does it have some kind of awareness of its surroundings? When it can feel pain, for example, because thats one of the most brute kinds of awareness there could be. And that happens, interestingly enough, just around the time of viability. It certainly doesnt happen with an embryo.  It's unique DNA shouldn't be the deciding factor in it's humanity. After all, twins share the exact same DNA and they are not considered one person.  Carcinogens in cigarettes and radiation can change someone's DNA into a unique cell. Surely this newly mutated piece of DNA isn't a human.  The only defining characteristic that is reasonably and unambiguous when concerning what makes a human being is consciousness. Which happens around 20 weeks or so and can be tested for. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yep, what toanoma said exactly, except that I would have phrased it as "at no point in the process did something that was not alive become alive".  I think it's important because we need to remember that just being a living human cell or group of cells does not confer any rights whatsoever. Now, some people believe that a zygote has rights for other reasons, but we need to keep the focus on what those reasons are rather than simply saying that the cells in the zygote are alive.
TwoXChromosomes X Pro-choice.  If my pregnancy is an accident (unlikely in the first place because I am on the pill), then my child shouldn't have to suffer through an unstable upbringing.  As an independent, mature 21-year old, I know that I would not be able to adequately support a child given my current circumstances as a student.  Bringing a child into the world at this point in my life would do more harm to the child than good.  If it is an unplanned/accidental/unwanted pregnancy, carrying and delivering the child is invasive.  Even if I were to give the child up for adoption, that would be 9+ months of my life disrupted for the sake of someone else's conscience.  I don't think so.
TwoXChromosomes X Pro-choice. Their body, their choice! I believe that zygote, embryo &amp; fetus is not a life until after birth or it is able to breathe on its own.
TwoXChromosomes X I thought I was being responsible by getting an exam and bc prescription before having sex, but the nurse taking my medical history actually laughed at me for being a 19 year old virgin in a 1-year-long hetero relationship. As if I wasn't already nervous about having a freezing cold speculum rammed into my vagina, she makes me feel like I made some very wrong choices.
TwoXChromosomes X A second recommendation for Taking Charge of your Fertility. You can also get some really cheap ovulation tests (usually combo'd) with pregnancy tests on amazon.  I bought 50 tests (40 ovulation and 10 pregnancy).  That'll help you with understanding your fertility - along with the book. For more on the cheap-o tests check out - ! I have two ovaries but I anticipated problems and had none... so I wish the same for you. 
TwoXChromosomes X The religious argument against abortion is all that the pro-life crowd has; by trying to legislate when they believe life begins (and I definitely do not think life begins at conception), they are inserting their religious convictions into the argument in an attempt to create law. You never hear pro-lifers chanting *legal* precedent for why abortion should be illegal, but you always hear them telling women getting abortions that they are baby murderers. That's their religious opinion, and I think it would be a dangerous path to allow those opinions into the legal system.  We both seem to be pro-choice...so I'm not sure why you seem irritated by my comment. To me, it's this simple: if you don't believe in abortion for any moral or religious reason, don't get one. But you shouldn't be able to legally force your morality and religious view on me and my decision.
TwoXChromosomes X I just don't buy this logic. If a fully adult human being were to wedge themselves in my body and start leeching off of it, I would be allowed to tell them to GTFO, and have them forcefully evicted. Let's say my body is filled with some precious serum they require and if they are forced to leave, they will die. Even so, same deal: They do not have the right to force me to provide my body to save them.  *Edit for better analogy*: Someone is dying of organ failure and you're the one person on the planet who has the match that can save them. It probably will not kill you to donate the organ, but the procedure will result in lasting changes to your body and take nine months. It will probably hurt like hell. It is a very real possibility that the transplant will not be successful and they will die anyways. Should you be LEGALLY MANDATED to donate this organ?
TwoXChromosomes X If the pregnant woman was keeping the fetus and considered it a baby (and especially if the murderer considered it a baby) then it's a double murder. If you think you're taking a human life when you kill something, then it's murder. Also, if the fetus is far enough along that it is fully formed and could survive without the mother, then it's also murder.  That's just my opinion though. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think it can only be double murder if the murderer A) was aware of the fetus and B) had specific desire to kill it as well. As in, some guy finds out that his pregnant wife cuckolded him and that it isn't his, so he wants to kill her *and* the spawn both.    If she's late term, at the stage where the fetus could survive outside the womb--the stage at which most abortions are no longer legal--then it should be murder and manslaughter, even if he only cared about killing the woman.    As for forcing an abortion, is should be assault and battery, until the stage where the fetus would be viable, in which case it gets fuzzy. Certainly murder if delivery is induced and the infant is born alive, and then killed or purposefully left to die. Actually, if it's late term enough, murder in all cases. But if the attacker accidentally causes a miscarriage, that is not murder. Perhaps negligent homicide as well as assault and battery, if the fetus is viable.
TwoXChromosomes X a) I agree you will still be charged with accidental homicide, but it does not equal sentencing for murder 1.  b)the reason most doctors do not perform abortions after 20 wks is that it too nears the date at which a baby can survive outside of mother's body (ie could be given up for adoption). Also, it causes quite a bit of trauma on the pregnant woman and is basically akin to giving premature birth. 
TwoXChromosomes X The solution to the dilemma of this law: make all abortions performed by pregnant women.  Can't kill that fetus now, can you?
TwoXChromosomes X Oh I understand why.  I knew it was going to happen to me too.  I think it is utter bullshit that we don't have better birth control options for men in pill form.  I think most women know someone who has sabotaged their birth control.  You can deny that fact if you like to.  I won't though, and I think it is crap that they do it.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;But the doctor is also a human being. Either killing is wrong, or it isn't.  I don't really buy that argument. I am, in the general case, against killing. However, it a terrorist took a child hostage and was about to execute him, I would be in favour of killing the terrorist to save the life of the hostage, on the basis that the innocent life is preserved, rather than the life of the would-be murderer. If I truly believed that life began at conception, I might feel the same way about abortion doctors. So no, I don't believe "either killing is wrong, or it isn't", and I don't think the vast majority of people think that either.
TwoXChromosomes X This is probably mentioned somewhere else, but cranberry pills are amazing. Definitely help reduce UTIs and you don't have to force yourself to drink liters of juice.
TwoXChromosomes X While I fully support women getting this vaccination, I feel I should point out that there are **dozens** of different strains of HPV and the vaccine only protects against 4 (the two definitively linked to cancer, and two that cause warts.) So getting the shot doesn't mean you're protected against the other strains, so it's still possible to get warts. 
BabyBumps X Wow, didn't know an ultrasound can be off. My last one put me forward a week which has had me freaking out as my husband has decided to tear up the house to remodel and do anything but the nursery. There is enough time he claims .... uh, there is 98 days left. :(   Take it easy guinnessmom, I know that's hard to do, but try. I stressed out a lot in the beginning and I sometimes wonder if that didn't make the morning sickness worse. Hoping you have a happy and healthy pregnancy! 
TwoXChromosomes X I've seen both and don't care either way if my partner is or is not circumcised. I would never circumcise a male child of mine unless a doctor could give me some legitimate medical necessity for it. I think it's barbaric to do that to a child... no matter what your religious beliefs.   If a grown man wants to be circumcised for cosmetic reasons, that's his choice and right.
TwoXChromosomes X The shopping in Montana's pretty sparse, but we have a Gap, JC Penney's, Macy's, and a few smaller stores at the mall. The Old Navy here just closed (sad panda), but we're supposed to be getting a Kohl's. Online, I love H&amp;M, Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, and Modcloth. I'm a bigger girl, so I feel like if I want clothes that fit really well (as opposed to clothes that just cover me), I need to shop online. How about you?
TwoXChromosomes X You should believe your doctor. [About 74% of adult Americans have been infected with genital HPV at one point in their lives.]( _learn_myths.cfm) You and your baby will be fine.  If you'd like, you can insist upon receiving an annual pap smear for the rest of your life, even if your doctor doesn't think it's necessary, because you consider yourself at high risk for cervical cancer.  You should tell your boyfriend to get his man bits checked, but if he got it too, it's OK. It's common and eminently treatable.  Congrats on the little one!  Edit: typo
TwoXChromosomes X Indeed. The PP clinic in my city doesn't even freaking provide abortion services, yet there are always anti-abortion protesters that harass the women going into there. The location just provides birth control and health care, but they're automatically equated with "abortion clinic" and vilified. It's sad.
TwoXChromosomes X Gardasil is not meant to clear pre-existing HPV; the vaccine blocks the infection of certain strains of HPV. Strains that are most likely to cause cervical cancer.  While the necessity of the vaccine is debatable as HPV often clears itself, and people are less commonly infected by the types of HPV that Gardasil protects against, it has indeed been shown to prevent precancerous cell changes that are associated with the aforementioned strains.  There has been 1 death per every 1,000,000 doses of Gardasil administered. For someone who has already had their immune system compromised by HPV, the benefits may outweigh the risks.   Edit: but that is something to discuss with a GP. 
TwoXChromosomes X it helps prevent HPV, but it doesn't clear up existing HPV. however there are many strands of HPV, and she might have on strand, but not all of the others. gardasil is not useless for the OP.
TwoXChromosomes X At this point, not even abortions: contraception, std screenings, family planning services... :(
TwoXChromosomes X Am I the only one bothered by the fact that she repeatedly referred to her aborted fetus as a "baby"?  I don't think a fetus becomes a baby until birth when it is an actual separate entity from the mother.  And it is for this reason that I am pro-choice.  To me, referring to the fetus as a baby supports the notion that abortion is an act of murder.  Aborting a "fetus" and aborting a "baby" mean two very different things.
TwoXChromosomes X I think it varies by pill.  I take ortho cyclen and it says it needs to be taken within a 3 hour window.  I know planned parenthood info says that progesterone-only pills need to be taken even closer to the same time than combination pills.  I don't like to take any chances though so I take it at exactly the same time everyday and I've never been more than 15 minutes off either way.   
TwoXChromosomes X That's interesting and makes a lot of sense to me. When I was taking a low-dose birth control pill, my period started the next day when I started the placebos. But now that I'm on a higher hormone dose, it starts like 3-4 days after I start the placebos.
TwoXChromosomes X It does vary per pill.   A combined pill normally has a 12 hour window. Low oestrogen pills have a 3-8 hour window. Some progesterone - only pills have less than 3 hour window. 
Parenting X My daughter did that too. She was 8 lbs 14oz at birth  In 24 hours &gt; 10% weight loss so we supplemented  By discharge she was 7lbs 3 oz. I tried nursing and pumping but not enough came out to satisfy my baby. At her first checkup she gained as much as the doctor expected and continued to do well. She was on all formula by 3 weeks.  Tell your wife she is doing ok. If she has to use both breast milk and formula there is nothing wrong with that. 
TwoXChromosomes X There's this: (Vagisil, sold in drugstores, pH test) -discharge-infections-screening-kit.shtml  The website says that the normal pH is around 4.5 or lower- which is already quite acidic. It says that most conditions occur when the 'bad bacteria' increases, giving a more alkaline environment.   He might be allergic to your fluids or the lube you're using?  Or, he could have a yeast infection. It's possible. 
TwoXChromosomes X Not enough people are saying this- THE PILL ISN'T EFFECTIVE FOR A WHOLE MONTH AFTER YOU START TAKING IT. If you plan to have sex next week, by all means go see your doctor and get some BC but don't rely on it for at least a month. Use condoms too. They work. 
TwoXChromosomes X Even if you're not sexually active you should still get a PAP smear as they're not just to check for STIs. They can detect infections and cancer too.
TwoXChromosomes X You're ahead of me.  My kids were 10 weeks early (triplets), and the first time I held my son, he stopped breathing.  First time I held daughter A, she stopped breathing.  Daughter B breathed for me, but she quit when I gave her to my best friend :-)  I still don't think that she's forgiven me for that (damn apnea and bradychardia).  I almost faint now when someone gives me a kid under 10 pounds to hold...I got used to it with mine, but infants are SMALL. 
BabyBumps X I  did not circumcise my son. It's a medically unnecessary procedure, and there's no reason to submit an infant to that kind of pain. I believe in the importance of my son's bodily autonomy. I also think it's genital mutilation.  This is a pretty charged subject people often feel strongly about. If you do pose this question to OneY as someone suggested, you'll even find some men trying to reconstruct their foreskin.  They get pretty passionate about it over there.  Weirdly, my opinion on it is much stronger than my husband's. Most cut guys don't really seem to care.
BabyBumps X Circumcision is a non-reversible procedure, so it's important to thoroughly research it before making the final decision. Here are some facts and links to get you started:  * no medical association in the world (including the AAP and AMA) recommends routine infant circumcision - [here is the most recent policy from a medical association]( ?uuid=579e836d-ea83-410f-9889-feb7eda87cd5&amp;owner=a8a9ce0e-f42b-47a5-960e-be08025b7b04&amp;contentid=77976&amp;elementid=771754)  * the foreskin, ridged band, and frenulum all serve a [purpose]( ), and should not be amputated unless there is a medical problem  * if you leave him intact, you preserve your son's right to choose what he wants his body to look like, but a man who was circumcised as a child cannot ever fully regain what is [lost]( )  * circumcision has many [risks]( -rr.htm), such as [bleeding]( _genital_mutilation_being_promoted_by_dr/c1bzkzq), skin tags or meatitis, and in very rare cases, [amputation of the glans]( -8987-to-snip-or-not-to-snip.html) or [death]( )  [Circumcision: Information for parents]( )  [Collection of circumcision links for parents]( ?t=4159)  [Cirp.org - Information for Parents]( )  [Mothering.com - Do you regret circumcising your son?]( -you-regret-circumcising-your-son-s-please-post-here)  [50 Reasons to Leave "it" alone]( )
TwoXChromosomes X I had one of these and it would keep coming back ( i was using yeast infection cream bullets) it took me 3 months until i was in horrible itchy pain and went to the doctor he gave me some more cream and i didn't see it again. I got it from skinny dipping in a lake, or the sex afterwards. Have you been diagnosed or just treating it diy?
TwoXChromosomes X While I was "the poster child for easy IUD insertion" my friend had a hell of a time getting hers in and after two failed insertions they sent her to another planned parenthood. Apparently one of the doctors there was an awesome older gentleman who was a total pro at it and once he was able to get it in she was totally thrilled with it and had no further problems. Don't give up :)
TwoXChromosomes X Rockmeah, the bleeding is pretty consistent. It usually lasts for like 4-5 days. Each "period" brings cramp, bloating and tender breasts. I usually spot the first day and then bam, full flow.   I'll look into the book. It sounds like it could help, so thanks =)
TwoXChromosomes X I assume you're talking about the Pill specifically, but there are other options such as IUDs, NuvaRings, Norplant, Depo-Provera, etc. you can ask about.  To answer your specific question regarding the Pill,  - talk to your Dr, get a prescription  - not high unless you are above 35, smoke, or have a history of blood clots (or, I assume, someone in your family does)  - some will tell you the pill makes you gain weight but most studies and Dr's will tell you it doesn't. every body is different and side effects may vary  - no it won't make you grow hair  - yes, make sure your Dr knows about your anti-depressant and any other meds, vitamins, etc. you might be taking. hormonal birth control may cause changes in your personality whether you're on an anti-depressant or not. some people have to try to several pills to get one that doesn't affect their feelings. talk to your Dr.  - you use a condom as backup protection and to prevent against STDs. You should absolutely definitely use a condom even if you take the Pill. 
TwoXChromosomes X I also had Paragard inserted a year ago (December 2009). My facts: &gt; * (was) 20 years old &gt; * Very painful cramping days 1 and 2 of period &gt; * Very heavy period &gt; * Not married, but in L-T relationship &gt; * Never been pregnant &gt; * Did it with university health insurance at Planned Parenthood for $20 &gt; * I believe in using non-hormonal birth control methods  I agree that the measurement part was the worst part as well as moving during the days after. I spent a lot of time curled up in a blanket next to my boyfriend. Also, I waited a couple weeks before starting intercourse again, but I would start cramping again soon afterward having sex. I also had a lot of spotting between periods.  For me, the seven months I had it in were pretty painful. My boyfriend complained a lot about his sore arm because I gripped it so hard all the time. I also had an ultrasound two months after insertion to make sure it was in the right place. The doctor assured me that it was. After seven months, the strings descended dramatically and I knew it was coming out. I went and had it removed.  I attribute my bad time with the IUD to having a history of bad cramps and heavy periods (though, I did have a lot of fun with the bif). One thing to consider is that it really varies from individual to individual. I may have had a rough time, but that is definitely not true for everyone.  But all was not for nothing!  In the end, I noticed that my periods are not as painful as they were before the IUD (a BIG plus). Before the IUD, my cramps were so bad that I would practically stay in bed all day. I even cut a lot of high school because I couldn't deal with going to gym. The cramps I experience now are a tenth to a fifth in strength than before and I can be active the whole day. For this reason alone, I definitely think it was worth it. (Again, I am against taking hormones, so no birth control solution for me :P).  I hope the cramps go away for you soon, but if they persist for more than a month or two, please consult a doctor or get checked. Also, make sure to keep your hands very clean when checking the strings.
TwoXChromosomes X I think I'm one of the lucky ones. While my periods have changed since getting my Paragard two months ago... my periods are actually less fierce now. The cramps have changed and I can finally tell which ovary is being the menace of the month.  Overall... very much worth it.
TwoXChromosomes X 'viable' being the key term. I agree with you that it is unethical to abort a viable baby (I presume that by viable you mean that it could live outside the womb at that point in time).  We decide for everyone that murder is wrong because people have rights, and 'the right to live' is one of them. But people don't have the right to say what other people can and cannot do with their own body. So I think that in fact we can ignore people who think that a woman does not have the right to expel an unviable fetus from her body (a fetus feeds from the mother...it may contain human DNA, but while it is unviable it is essentially a parasite).  I think that all pro-choicers could agree that a fetus has rights when it could be viable outside the womb, but until it is actually born, the mothers right to life supercedes that of the fetus (so that a woman whose life was at risk in the 3rd trimester would legally be able to abort) until it is born and becomes a citizen.  It would be far harder to find some sensible common ground between pro-lifers (who seem to see women as worthless) and pro-choicers, though. 
TwoXChromosomes X My IUD experience was unusually bad--I was told that most women experience pain akin to their worst period cramps, and mine was pretty far beyond that. But I have absolutely no regrets! Being baby-free for twelve years is totally worth fifteen minutes of pain, even extreme pain. So don't be scared! I survived, and so will you, and it will be worth it!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;   abortions kill fetuses   Abortions are usually performed before the embryo reaches the fetal stage.  So, no.
TwoXChromosomes X I track my cycle monthly; I had egg whitey discharge on the 8th, not as much as normal but enough to know that I was ovulating.     so to recap.   My LMP started on Jan 26th, pretty sure I Ovulated on the 8th/9th.   usually have 14 days from the start of my last period and the day I ovulate. 
TwoXChromosomes X No, I'm saying that if they believe that less abortion doctors will lead to less abortions, and that abortion is systematic murder, it would be their moral duty to take out the abortion doc. Since they don't actually do this, they must either believe that ease of access does not strongly relate to the number of abortions performed, or that terminating the pregnancy isn't actually murder.  Because we know the first statement is (for most of the anti-choice population) false, the latter must be true.
TwoXChromosomes X I have PCOS, even though I don't have all the cysts they talk about. Basically, I can never count on my period. I'd get it once to twice a year if I wasn't on birthcontrol to regulate my hormones. I've been on birth control for about 9 years now, missed pills, had countless condoms break, not had periods for months at a time even while on the pill, I was never pregnant, my body just messes with me.     If you're having the usual breast pains, head aches and other PMS symptomes, I wouldn't worry, you might get a late/heavy flow period any day now. 
TwoXChromosomes X I love how they mention the little girl at the end, and ask if her life matters; of course it does, she was born. I don't know the context of it all but it's unfair to bring up a 3 year old little girl and then put her life above her moms.   If my mother's life was in danger when I was in the womb I would say, to this day, abort me. I wasn't me yet, I was just a cluster of cells. She could potentially have another child and actually be around to raise that kid. I know everyone doesn't have a mom but most of us who do are thankful for them.
TwoXChromosomes X From the Implanon website  &gt; The most common side effect of IMPLANON is a change in your menstrual periods. In studies, about 1 in 10 women stopped using IMPLANON because of bleeding problems. Expect your menstrual periods to be irregular and unpredictable throughout the time you are using IMPLANON. You may have more bleeding, less bleeding, or no bleeding. -usa.com/consumer/isimplanonrightforme/copy_2_of_questionstoaskyourhcp/index.asp?C=42576405989681712963&amp;svarqvp2=0&amp;componentid=186740&amp;sourcepageid=68182#1  I don't have the link to the Depo Provera site offhand but you should be able to read the medical information about it there. My Dr told me it's normal to stop menstruating and just have some spotting once in awhile with Depo. I'd only had one period than another couple weeks of spotting since I started it about 8 months ago. I don't know anything about Nuva Ring but again, you can probably find the website. If you're still concerned, talk to your Dr. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, abortions kill fetuses, but how is that relevant to the responsibility issue? Of course, I see how the fetus's death is relevant to the overall abortion debate, but it has nothing to do with the issue of avoiding responsibility.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't know, that just doesn't make sense to me. There are 28 pills. 7 are placeholders.  If you took the non-placeholder pill during your period, then you would get your period again after 14 days when you got to the placeholder pills, instead of after 21 days. I would call your doctor to confirm.
TwoXChromosomes X Antibiotics can cause the birth control pill to fail.  If you're using a course of antibiotics, make sure to use condoms (if you don't already anyway).  
TwoXChromosomes X use them for the first month of taking the pill. Some can be safe after two weeks but I'm the paranoid type.
TwoXChromosomes X the doc didn't seem concerned about that as long as the flow was heavy enough to warrant needing 2, and they were changed out frequently. We are not talking about using 2 all day, every day. Only when i was going thru 1 super plus every hour or so, for only days i was working and couldn't get frequent breaks.
TwoXChromosomes X I wish I had known the pill can kill your sex drive. It took me many years to figure it out.  It seems that the pill can have a variety of side effects, and it's different for everyone, so just pay attention to any changes that may occur after you start...some side effects can take a while to manifest too.
Parenting X Most babies are born on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Because that's when OB-GYNs tend to have regularly scheduled hospital hours.  Sunday is the rarest day to be born.  Because, you know, golf.  Avoid induction.  It's rarely medically necessary and tends to turn into C-sections.  Just tell the doc to fuck off.  Believe it or not, eventually the baby will come out on its own.
Parenting X I don't know if this was the case at all, but your cousin may not have been as overdue as everyone thought. Unless a woman knows her menstrual cycle very well and keeps track of the days she has had sex, it can be very difficult to pin down the date of conception. If a woman has an irregular cycle and isn't keeping track of things like basal temperature, mucus, etc., it can be well-nigh impossible. Usually they go from when you last missed a period, but, like I said, if her cycle is irregular forget about it. Which leaves the doctors guessing the due date based on various qualitative parameters such as body size estimated from ultrasound. Since babies come in many sizes, this guesstimation, as you might guess, has a high uncertainty. 
TwoXChromosomes X They all pretty much all test the same. You could get them at the $1 store and they'll probably come out positive if you're prego. Relax! Getting pregnant is actually hard a lot of the time :p
TwoXChromosomes X never had fluid come out of it. i just squeezed it really hard (lol) and now my boob just hurts. its just a lump that hurts and makes my left nipple/boobie more sensitive than my right. but the lump tends to grow/shrink (i think) in accordance to my period?
Parenting X Just throwing in one more opinion. Being induced sucks unless you really need it. With my first daughter I was induced because of 'low amniotic fluid', but it was really because my doctor was on rounds that night. I ended up in the most pain I've ever had in my life within about 20 minutes of getting the pitocin. This led to an epidural (of course) that slowed the labor that they just started to a crawl. 8 hours later, I would've been in for a c-section but there wasn't time, so they used a vacuum (kind of like foreceps). Second daughter, I actually took hypnobirthing classes to help with my fear of an epidural. Did that one natural and it was quick and easy.  Basically, doctors want to get the baby out, but they don't really have  much incentive to make it easy on the mother. It's all about what's convenient and easy for them. C-sections are way up because of the inductions. It dramatically increases your chances of an emergency c-section. And, conveniently, c-sections mean more money for all involved.
TwoXChromosomes X The situation I described is similar to this woman's story.  That's why I didn't feel the need to respond.  A baby was killed near the end of the pregnancy in both situations.  In one case it was deemed second degree murder, in the other it's called a "partial birth abortion".  I don't see what the difference is.  You tell me why that abortion doctor wasn't charged with murder.
TwoXChromosomes X Some antibiotics can lower the pills effectiveness so during that time it would be good to use a condom.
TwoXChromosomes X You and your boyfriend can use your vibrator together. Some women don't have orgasms through sex.  Or only have orgasms from clitoral stimulation.  Or only from penetration.  Or only from penetration AND clitoral stimulation.    You have to find what works for you.
TwoXChromosomes X Actually I was talking about your hand. Many women can't have an orgasm through vaginal stimulation only, so the easiest way to me seems to just touch yourself while you're both at it (a vibrator might be kinda difficult at times, spacewise down there ;)). Or is your hand not something you'd like to use?
TwoXChromosomes X You're being downvoted, but you do have a point.   The ability to chose to continue a pregnancy is one that only women currently get to make. I personally value my right to chose greatly. A man can no more force a woman to keep his child as he can force her to abort his child. The act of being able to chose to continue the pregnancy and be a parent is taken away from the man. Since he cannot force a woman to get his abortion, should he be able to formally denounce the pregnancy/ state he will not be apart of the child's life at all (including financially) and make the woman fully aware so that she can be fully informed of what her decision to keep the child would entail (ie single parent, no child support). I would think this would have to happen very early in the pregnancy (first trimester or so), but I think that there should be a period where he can effectively terminate his attachment to the pregnancy, just like a woman could chose to terminate the pregnancy its self.   From what I understand though the state would not like a situation like this because they have to provide welfare ect to the child and getting the money from the biological father is much more enticing to them / cheaper for the citizenry as a whole.  None the less, the current situation in inequitable, a woman has the right to chose and a man does not, and that should be recognized. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have a really hard time with this as well.  I wouldn't say numb, for me, but it's definitely much, much harder to get myself off during penetration.  It's like the PIV intercourse is actually distracting to getting a clitoral orgasm for me.  I usually have to have him stop (and just hold inside) or just go much slower, to be able to get it to happen, which then I feel like i'm interrupting the whole thing  :(  
TwoXChromosomes X I've had a paraguard for two years and I've never had a child. Insertion wasn't bad at all (just like the worst period cramps you've ever had for a few minutes) and cramping for like a week or so after. Definitely not anything meriting more than a few advil and maybe a heating pad, but it was nice to have my boyfriend there to drive me home after.   For the first six months I got worse cramps around my period just like the doctor said might happen and after that everything went right back to normal. I didn't have an ultrasound beforehand, the doctor just checked me.    Overall, I'm over the moon happy with it :)
TwoXChromosomes X Why is taking turns annoying? Sure, finishing together is probably a nice idea, but it's wholly unnecessary. I've had a ton of sex with many people and I think the only time I ever managed to finish around the same time as my partner, it occurred entirely by accident. Taking turns is no big deal. In fact, it can be nice to focus on just one person at a time, since then you're both actively involved in making the other's orgasms happen, rather than just chugging along. So don't worry about it and just enjoy the ride.  Another thing: you may be more able to orgasm during more intense sex with practice. So... you should practice more. Lots more. I'm sure he won't mind. =D
TwoXChromosomes X I have not given birth and also chose ParaGard. I've never done well with hormonal BC (it kills my sex drive... I suppose not having sex is effective birth control, but that's not quite what I wanted! ;)  I got mine inserted at 24. No ultrasound, and I believe I was in the office for about an hour. I don't remember exactly, but the procedure itself including sounding took less than 15 mins I think. It hurt *bad* (real bad)... only for about 4 seconds. It went away right after that. I don't want to downplay how much it hurt for me, because it sure did; but it really did only last for a couple seconds. I was able to stand and get dressed again within a couple minutes (just a little shaky, probably from residual nervousness honestly).  The lortab is probably unnecessary. I took 800mg ibuprofen about 45 minutes before insertion on the NP's advice. I'd listen to your doctor on this one and not take the lortab.  I went alone and drove myself back no problem. That said, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have your boyfriend go with you. Some women are pretty weak right after; in fact the NP was surprised I got back up as quickly as I did. So your mileage may vary here.  After insertion, for about a month I had random cramps. Nothing worse than my normal menstrual cramps, but it did last off and on for about a month. Advil helped me through that.  I'm 26 now, so have had the ParaGard for 2 years. Side effects I've noticed include heavier menstrual cramps for one day a month, and slightly heavier bleeding. Oddly enough though, my periods seem to be shorter than they used to before the IUD. I guess the heavier flow means I run outta blood faster? ;)   I just plain absolutely love my IUD. It's fantastic and is definitely worth the one day of extra cramps! I don't think I could recommend it enough. 
TwoXChromosomes X Like triliana said, these people really do believe that a clump of cells with the potential to grow into a baby constitutes a baby. They honestly see it as murder. I don't agree with their position, and I think it's pretty crazy, but that is really truly what they believe and they do see women who get abortions as murderers. These women still have the opportunity to "repent and come back to Jesus," and you'll hardly ever find someone calling a woman in their church a murderer for having had an abortion, but abortion in general is actually considered murder.   And some of these people have come to this conclusion rationally. They see the fertilized egg as the start of human life and see any destruction of that egg, once inside the mother, as an ending of a life. A fertilized egg, if not genetically screwed up, will grow into a baby if given the right environment. It really comes down to the fact that you don't see a fertilized egg as being equal to a post-birth human, and they do. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think they are pro unborn life but anti born life. 
TwoXChromosomes X I believe it depends on where you live. In MA, the cut-off is 24 weeks, because after that the fetus is determined to be viable as a preemie. After the 24 week mark, a physician may only perform an abortion to save the life of the mother or preserve her mental health.   Also, the earlier an abortion is performed, the safer it is. 
TwoXChromosomes X I see nothing wrong with creating an incentive to have fewer kids but I do see targeting poor women as being wrong.  I would venture a guess that the reason we see more poor moms with multiple kids is because they have less access to birth control and sex education.  
TwoXChromosomes X Well.. staying hydrated is often really helps with my period pain, also I keep my computer or my charger on my stomach, and the warmth helps soothe the pain! 
TwoXChromosomes X I am a big fan of the Divacup, and I liked using Instead too... when it worked. Sometimes it worked perfectly, and sometimes it seemed to do nothing at all! I made sure to put it in correctly as best I could, and I feel like I was putting it in the same way every time. I have no idea why it only worked *sometimes*. When it didn't work, it wasn't minor leakage either... all the blood seemed to completely miss the cup.  The other thing about the Instead is that removal is messier. Seems like there's no way to avoid spillage on the way out, but I always deal with cups in the shower so that wasn't a huge deal.  Anyway, go ahead and give Instead a shot. I really liked the thing when it worked correctly.
TwoXChromosomes X I just had a colposcopy two Thursdays ago.   I had two paps come back abnormal with low risk cells so my doctor recommended I get a colpo.  The doctor that did it didn't actually take any samples.  He did note there is something going on on the side of my vaginal wall, but my body is pretty much taking care of it on it's own.  Woohoo.  My sister-in-law's little sister is about my age and she has a high risk strain of HPV.  She's basically just having yearly paps to make sure her cell samples don't come back worst.   If things do develop badly she will have to have a colpo and biopsy.  Treatment will go from there.  From what my doctor told me it's something to keep an eye on with paps every 6 months to year, and if it does develop into cancer and is caught early on it is very easy to take care of and live a normal life.  Before you go in to your appointment in two weeks ask the doctor or nurse how much ibuprofen you can take before hand.  I didn't even have a biopsy, but I was in pain the entire time. On a scale of 0-5 it was a 3.5, but my cervix is very sensitive.   Edit: I forgot to add something.  HPV can linger in your body for years before popping up and causing issues. Don't worry about your husband.  I spent some time wondering who I picked it up from, but there isn't any way to know.  Some doctors will tell you your body can take care of HPV on it's own and be gone in a few years, and others say it can sort of linger undetected for the rest of your life.  As long as you keep going for regular paps it's not a big deal as long as your colpo goes ok.
TwoXChromosomes X Make sure you check if you are taking triphastic or monophastic pills before you do this. This method works for monophastic pills, but for triphasic, it is a different procedure.   I would start earlier, because you dont know if there will be breakthrough bleeding. 
TwoXChromosomes X I could never get the hang of the diva either, but I looooved the Instead cup (got an IUD and don't get a period anymore). I never had a problem with leakage, and they are so much easier to insert than the diva cup.   A tip that other people will think is scary/gross, but 5 years of grad school in microbiology tells me is perfectly safe: you don't have to throw it out every 12 hours. Wash it thoroughly with soap and warm water, and you could really just use one for your entire period. I wouldn't save them between periods, because then you'd probably want to really sanitize them with something, and I don't think the plastic could hold up to that.
TwoXChromosomes X I completely agree with your ideas.  As I was debating someone on reddit recently about abortion they mentioned something about what my cutoff limit was.  I was surprised by the question because I hadn't fully considered my position on this, I was always just "pro-choice" and somehow it hadn't come up.  While the idea of an abortion at 35 weeks or something made me uncomfortable, there was no way I could justify deciding for someone else what was an appropriate cutoff time.  If someone says the limit should be 24 weeks, how is the day after that any different?  I think supporting late-term abortions is a controversial position, even within the pro-choice movement, when it really shouldn't be.  People may be uncomfortable with someone having an abortion with something that more resembles a "baby" but that shouldn't dictate what is acceptable and what is law.  For me, it really comes down to limiting women's rights.  I see no reason to arbitrarily take away a woman's rights at a certain day or week even when others argue it is at the expense of a fetus or baby's rights.  
TwoXChromosomes X I think at the end of the day, if the fetus can survive outside of the womb, then abortion should not be allowed. This puts the cutoff around 24 weeks.  Aborting a baby at 25 weeks, 30? At that point why don't you just deliver it and give it to someone who wants it?
TwoXChromosomes X ...What if she wants to have an abortion the week before the babies due, a few days before the babies due? You're okay with them delivering a live, viable infant (in that it can survive on it's own) and killing it? Uh...that'll give the conservatives way to call pro-choicers "murderers" ... no thanks.
TwoXChromosomes X I liked them because you can have sex with one in with no bloody mess (as long as it doesn't leak, I had some issues with that but I might have had it in wrong) but they're SUPER messy when you take them out.
TwoXChromosomes X I find them far more awkward to insert than reuseable cups, and taking them out is incredibly messy.  Also, I've found that it sometimes dislodges itself when full, so all the blood just comes pouring out in the middle of whatever you're doing.    I found the DivaCup to be uncomfortable at times, and now have a Meluna cup which I find much more comfortable. 
TwoXChromosomes X Are you using pills that have the same level of hormone in every pill? I tried to do this before too, but then I realized that with each week of my pill pack, the hormone doses were changing, and that made me have breakthrough bleeding/a period. I changed to the monophasic version of my pills, and voila!
BabyBumps X I plan on going natural, but if the pain becomes too much for me to deal with, I won't feel bad about getting an epidural. There are a lot of things you can do on your own to make childbirth easier: drinking lots of water in the weeks beforehand, perineum massage, different exercises, not to mention birthing classes, etc.    And pain is only temporary. If getting an epidural means more complications with you or your babies health, why risk it? I would suggest not planning on anything for now. Just decide when you are actually in labor, see what the pain is like for you, and go from there.
BabyBumps X My own doula had to get one herself for a very similar reason. I'm all for a natural birth myself but will take it if it's best for me.  Besides,  I'd rather have an epidural than an emergency c-section which could happen if you don't get the rest and can't push (I hear).
TwoXChromosomes X I think you are a bit late, trying to postpone now. By the way, this long period of time between periods could mean that you are currently not ovulating and could mean you are less fertile. If that worries you (you probably don't want kids now, but later) go see a doctor and have it checked out (or remember to do that by the time that you want kids (and perhaps have more money)).
TwoXChromosomes X I'm so sorry for you. Have you contacted the organisation of endometriosis patients for some help/tips/a good doctor?  One thing to do might be to avoid having periods by using BC methods that postpone / stop your periods?  It is of course not a solution and doesn't tell you what's causing the pain, but having this pain, say, four times a year instead of twelve times is perhaps more bearable?  Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't really believe that in absence of any other stimulus, no.  I've been pregnant twice - one I terminated, one was intentional.  The first time I had no idea; I was 2 weeks late which was unusual, but then I started getting bouts of strong nausea.  Pregnancy confirmed.  The second pregnancy, I again got the nausea really early; I hadn't even missed my period yet, but I recognized the symptom and tested - and voila.
TwoXChromosomes X What does...what mean? The two lines? That looks like a positive pregnancy test. I always heard that even if the line is faint, it counts as a positive (as long as you look at it in the correct timeframe)  I would wait until tomorrow and take another test using first-morning urine. 
TwoXChromosomes X Out of my 4 kids - my last was the only one that I had that intuition with. With my first three, I only thought about being pregnant after I realized my period was late. When I got pregnant the fourth time, I kid you not, I knew right away. It was still too early to test and my period wasn't due for a few weeks, but I just knew. 
TwoXChromosomes X It seems like a pretty simple question. I'm no doctor, but I have changed between types of birth controll pill before and not used a backup method after the very first month. So yeah, based on my experience, I think you're pretty safe to use just the pill. 
BabyBumps X That's from FertilityFriend, right?  Have you done their free charting course?  It's pretty helpful.  Basically assuming the red crosshairs are correct, and you ovulated CD22/21st Feb, you're still probably a week away from being able to test positive.  There's no convincing rise or temperature pattern around CD14.  It's the first part of a cycle that usually varies in length, the second half (luteal phase) is pretty fixed for each woman.  Illness, stress, many factors can make the first half longer.  Also some months, even in healthy fertile women, are anovulatory (no ovulation).  If you're concerned, you could consider trying OPKs/ovulation prediction kits in future cycles.  Some women also record the cervix position.  The more signs you have, and the more they sync up, the more sure you can be of what's happening in your cycle.  But really, temperature and CM are the main ones.  
TwoXChromosomes X I could never. I discharge way too much, soaking into pants at times. I have used paper towels to clean myself up at times. Doesn't matter what I do, it's just how my body works. I've given in and wear liners most of the time now, because it's the only way to stay clean. Otherwise I'd have to change every time I went to the bathroom, most days.
TwoXChromosomes X I've ranged from 2 days to 8 days. I just continue my BC once it's due, and get a late period. I'm usually 4-6 days though. This month, 4 days. 
TwoXChromosomes X As far as I know, the Mirena is actually MORE effective than the Paraguard against pregnancy. Also, I think it's smaller than the Paraguard so perhaps is less likely to be expelled?
TwoXChromosomes X Um, the Mirena is 99.9% effective.  That means out of every hundred people having sex for a whole year, it's staggeringly unlikely that any one of them will get pregnant.  At any rate, that's several percent higher than oral birth control.  You're being pretty crazy. If you are that worried, make sure the bf wears condoms every time
TwoXChromosomes X What you shouldn't do is what I did, and have sex with a tampon, causing the tampon to get very stuck up inside of yourself. It was fine, just... uncomfortable as I had to extract it (he pushed the string waaaay up there)
TwoXChromosomes X But it's not? There are other options aside from abortion however it is the one that comes under attack the most though. Or the one that people believe is the only viable option. Women get to choose, that's the point, whether to carry to term to keep, carry to term to put up for adoption, or abort. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's possible you're pregnant, it's also possible these are symptoms of stress (Maybe even stressing that you're pregnant). Honestly, it's best not to stress out too much until you can test, because stress can delay your period, freaking you out more.  Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X OK let me lay it out in a different way:  I believe that life begins when brain activity begins, this makes sense to me. Before that it's impossible for a fetus to experience pain or any negative emotion, because it doesn't have the faculties to do so. If you want to argue against abortion after that point I'm fine with that. I do not know what exact point a child will start to feel emotion or pain, I do know it's impossible without a working brain, because it's your brain the processes everything. People can be put under hypnosis for surgery and not feel pain, it's still done today for those who can not be put under anesthesia. If you can control the brain you can render even your most basic animalistic functions moot.  You believe that life begins at conception. Why should I believe that? You keep saying "I'm being on the safe side". First, I see no legitimate reason I should believe that life beings at conception aside from "because you say so." Second, you are still ignoring; the inherent risk childbirth has on the mother (this includes rape victims who you want to force to carry their rapists babies,) the risk to both the mother and the potential offspring's quality of life and the risk to society when babies are born in to poverty or abusive households.  There is no reason to believe that life begins at conception. It's a few cells dividing at that point, if it doesn't begin right at conception then you have to be able to explain at which exact point it begins. Because banning and stigmatizing abortion and throwing mothers in prison at such a vulnerable point in their lives, has huge repercussions for both those involved directly and society as a whole, so you have to be able to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that your position is correct in order for you to change anything.  Reducing term limits is one discussion I can understand and has some valid points, discussion on banning abortion outright is absurd. If you still don't get it then there is nothing more than I can say, I have a life to get to.
TwoXChromosomes X My sister took Depo for a long time, and she had wild mood swings. Sometimes she'd get the shot and be fine, other times it was crazypants sister time until she had to get the next one.  Anyway, I heard that depo can cause serious bone density loss causing osteoporosis. Please check with your doctor on this.
TwoXChromosomes X What gets me is having shove dry cotton up. A plastic applicator is at least smooth.
TwoXChromosomes X Alright. I need to know, in graphic detail, how exactly you use this thing, so I'm turning this into an AMA. Give me the step-by-step please ladies! I hate buying / disposing of tampons &amp; pads. But something about carrying around and emptying out a cup full of my menstrual blood grosses me out. So I need to ask some questions that might score high on someone's ick factor.  - How do you insert it? - How do you empty it? - How often do you have to empty it? - Do your fingers get gross &amp; bloody when you empty it / put it back in? - Does it stain your sink washing out the blood? - How long does it last? - Does it smell like your vagina after you use it? (Want to know this because I imagine you have to carry it around in your purse when you're not menstruating in case you start unexpectedly.)  That's all I can think of for now. 
TwoXChromosomes X I once had a tampon turn inside of me when my boyfriend and I were messing around. I guess it was the change in the vaginal size plus the lubrication. neither of us could reach the string and had to have it removed by a doctor. 
Parenting X Yes, i knew it was going to be an outrageous drain on us financially, physically and emotionally, but i stand by our decision to become parents.  
TwoXChromosomes X Well, kinda yeah. there are other ways to keep yourself from having a baby besides abortions, and tbh, abstinence isn't the end of the world, lol.  It isn't fair of anyone to think its okay to destroy the potential of an unborn child because they simply don't want to deal with the consequences of a certain lifestyle. Change your lifestyle, or use better protection, or have the child anyway, but don't just write off the life of a fetus like it is worth nothing, because it isn't.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you been tested for Celiac? Anemia that doesn't respond to iron supplements is a typical adult symptom. I was just going to suggest OP look into [gluten ataxia]( ). I was recently diagnosed gluten intolerant/celiac even though I didn't have the blood antibodies or "classic" symptoms. Endoscopy and small intestine biopsy showed that my villi were all messed up. Things are getting better now that I've modified my diet.
TwoXChromosomes X I had midwives that were part of an OB/GYN practice. I ended up with a few(very minor complications) so it really was the best of both worlds. The midwives were really fantastic and actually attended my weekly monitoring I required but it was nice to really know the doctor that would intervene if anything happened (although I didn't see him after my 7th month because I just didn't need to) Midwives in the hospital is really the best of both world in my opinion. I would do it the same way again given the chance. 
TwoXChromosomes X The rights of the fetus and the rights of the mother can be at odds with each other. While the rights of the fetus can't be all we think about, they have to be accounted for. Directly endangering the fetus's life (which wasn't what was happening in the article, but could happen) is serious and I think needs to be dealt with by the state, to a certain extent.
TwoXChromosomes X I have hypothroidism - and this was my only symptom. Getting your thyroid levels checked is super-easy and if they're off, the medication is super-cheap :D
TwoXChromosomes X I have had a "traditional" birth in a hospital and a waterbirth also in the hospital but with midwives and not OBs.  If I were to end up in the baby way again, I would choose midwife at the hospital for another waterbirth.  I am very pro-homebirth but as always it isn't for everyone and I think it probably isn't for me.  I feel "safer" in that vulnerable position in the hospital even though I know that midwives come with pitocin for PP bleeding and oxygen and are trained in CPR etc.  They ALSO clean up after the birth and get the mom tea etc before leaving.  It isn't as though you have to have a baby then clean up the mess yourself.  It is all a matter of where you feel most comfortable because if you are tense the labor will be more difficult but if you feel safe and can relax things will go much smoother.  
TwoXChromosomes X I love shopping their online store. We don't have Forever 21 in Australia and most of our clothes stores are really over-priced, so it's great to get so much cheap and decent stuff there (although the 50ish dollars shipping hurts).
TwoXChromosomes X I keep going in to find plain t-shirts, tights, basic things like that.  I have yet to buy anything because they always feel like they're going to fall apart the first time I wear them.  I can go to Goodwill and spend the same for better quality clothes.
TwoXChromosomes X I would rather have my baby at home.  I'm training to be a midwife, and I attend a lot of birth center births, which are great. I've attended only a few home births, but that's how I'd do it for myself.  I think I'd prefer to be in a relaxed and cozy environment where I can labor and birth my baby, and then just crawl in to bed and snuggle- not having to worry about driving my brand new baby home in a car.  If I had to have my baby in the hospital- I would choose one that is certified ["Baby Friendly."]( )  Hospitals are great for women and babies who need them.  For low risk women (which the majority of pregnant women are), birth center and home births are perfectly safe and a great option. Licensed Midwives and Certified Professional Midwives are trained to recognize women, prenatally, who aren't candidates for out-of-hospital births.   They also monitor Mom and Baby very closely in labor. They are trained in neonatal resuscitation and carry oxygen and emergency meds in case they need them. And if things step outside the norm, midwives will transport to the hospital where Mom and/or Baby can get the interventions they need that aren't available outside the hospital.  In the US there are also hospital-based birth centers that have nurse-midwives to attend the birth- which I think is great for women who aren't wanting a home birth and want to be close to the hospital.   Things I think every mom-to-be should consider in deciding if they want an out-of-hospital birth are:  Is it an option for you and your babe?  Are there skilled and licensed practitioners in your area that do out-of-hospital birth?  Do you want pain medication? (just because you decide to have an out-of-hospital birth doesn't mean you can't choose to go into the hospital for an epidural if you change your mind)  What type of provider and care are you looking for?  How close is your home or the birth center to a hospital?  etc.  The most important thing is that Mom is confident in herself and her providers and that she is comfortable with where she is. For some women, that will be the hospital- for others, it may be at home or in a birthing center.  :)
TwoXChromosomes X Very cool! My daughter was born May 21 (2008) but I was due May 22nd.  The book really helped me understand how labor actually worked and why staying relaxed helped (as well as how to stay relaxed).  If you have a midwife unit that works with your local hospital give them a ring too, they may be more "natural minded" than a regular OB.  That was the case here anyway with my daughters birth.  They were completely hands off and just let me do my thing unless I asked for something.
TwoXChromosomes X Just a precaution: If you are using latex condoms and considering this, be sure to use the silicone based kind as opposed to oil-based.  Oil based can destroy latex and ruin its effectiveness.
TwoXChromosomes X thank you for the info on the Femmecup!  Have been looking for diva alternative for same reason's as both you and OP.
TwoXChromosomes X TSS is [incredibly, incredibly rare]( _shock_syndrome), and in fact one of the benefits of the Diva Cup is that it collects menstrual fluid as opposed to absorbing it (TSS most often results from bacteria entering the bloodstream after tearing of vaginal tissue results from the drying caused by tampons or other absorption products).  The more you know...
TwoXChromosomes X Babies usually stop eating when their full. So there can be extra milk or not. That is generally when you have to express the milk. You're producing more than baby is drinking.   And if you have big boobs before you were pregnant it can be really uncomfortable. So that is why some moms pump...to have extra for later.
TwoXChromosomes X I used DivaCup twice and gave up. It was too long and the stem/tip too stiff, it was uncomfortable and wouldn't stay in place.  It was always slipping down no matter what I tried.  Then I tried the [MiaCup]( ), which is slightly shorter, much softer/more flexible (and purple!), and I had a much better experience.  I also like my short [MeLuna cup]( -m-36.html)-- it comes in different sizes/lengths, colors, and stem styles.
TwoXChromosomes X Really? They're the same pill? I didn't know that! Yea, mine comes with 21 actives, and i take all the actives and then go to the next pack. My doctor (well... student health center) knows all this, and she told me about not taking the active pill. I don't take the active pills at all, and go straight from one pack to the other. What do you think of that?
BabyBumps X I agree with you. The doctors here only prescribe folic acid and iron. I am taking a prenatal vitamin I brought from the US during my last visit. I want to start taking DHA, but I haven't found it here yet.  
TwoXChromosomes X IUDs are definitely not supposed to be embedded into the uterine wall... They are placed in the uterus. If they become embedded (rare), they are surgically removed. They have strings that hang out of the cervix. It's normal for the strings to be poky for the first few weeks, then they soften and curl around the cervix. The IUD itself wouldn't stab anyone, but before softening, the strings can be a little stabby.
TwoXChromosomes X Personally I looked into all the different brands (looked at the differences, read reviews, etc) and decided against a Diva Cup almost straight away. They're popular but that does not make them the best. I got a [Lady Cup]( ) and it's amazing. If you do decide to try a different cup I can't recommend Lady Cup enough.  If it's leaking it's most likely one of two things. The first is the shape of the cup, if it's not the correct shape for you then it won't work. What's far more likely though, is your placement.  I always check my cup about an hour before I've put it in because especially at the start of my period when my cervix is very low I have a habit of putting the cup too low. Yes, the rim of the cup must be below your cervix *but* it also has to be high enough that your muscles 'grip' the cup to give it a snug fit. If it's not snug or there's no seal then yeah, it'll leak.  To get a proper fit first figure out where your cervix is. It's lower and more open during your period so you should be able to find it with your index or middle finger without too much trouble. If you're not familiar with what it is it'll be like a little pudge with a slit/hole in it on the top wall. Once you've figured out how deep it needs to go you can insert the cup. I fold mind in half lengthways then hold it flat against my middle finger and push it in that way. Push it in quickly and as far as you can reach before it starts to pop out into a cup again. If you think you didn't get far enough push it up further (you can kind of push one side of it in and up and it'll move) you're better off putting it to far and pulling it back then not putting it in far enough, as a general rule. Prod it until it's fully unfolded and give it a gentle tug on the stem to make sure its formed a seal. So now put your figure up the front side of the cup and see if you can feel your cervix. If your cup is soft enough (which it will be unless it's shit) you'll be able to do this without moving it. If you can't feel your cervix then grats, you've done well. If you *can* then simple pull the cup down a bit until it's covered. I've never actually had to do this though, I'm not sure I could get it that high even if I tried, and despite being tall I'm working with a fairly short space down there.  I hope you can get yours working, because they're so brilliant once you get the hang of them. As a side note, why do you have a throwaway account to talk about your menstrual cup? There's something to be ashamed of, this is my normal account :)
TwoXChromosomes X My son was c-section at 36 weeks - my bp was suddenly and ridiculously high, and he was transverse (not comfortable, I can tell you!)  Recovery from c-section was horrifying - I was bruised from belly-button to thighs and kept in hospital for 10 days as I could barely walk.  I got pregnant again 9 months later (d'oh!).  Admitted to hospital at 36 weeks with high bp and I flat out refused c-section because I was soo scared - my dr was supportive of VBAC but only if I went into labour naturally - he wouldn't induce - but he didn't put me under any particular pressure to go the surgical route.  After five days in hospital, pre-eclampsia kicked in and I had to concede to the c-section.  At the time I was terribly disappointed - I never got the chance to go into labour with either of them and I really felt ripped off - there's so much pressure surrounding natural birth.  Now (12 years later), I can't believe I was so wrapped up in how they arrived - they were safe, healthy and now it makes no difference whatsoever how they got here..
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I find it very hard to believe that according to doctors 1/3 of the woman in this country don't have satisfactory pelvises for birth!  The pelvis isn't the only reason for having a c-section.  My aunt had one, for example, (after two vaginal deliveries) because my cousin was breech.  There's a [stack more reasons here]( _indepth.html).
TwoXChromosomes X Read the instructions that come with your BC. Mine says missing a pill in the first week requires starting an entirely new packet and using alternate methods of contraception, but missing one later than that will likely not affect the chance of getting pregnant. Better safe than sorry, though, so if you think you missed one, use condoms or some such.
TwoXChromosomes X It takes about a year for the depo to clear out of your system.  My cycle had never been regular, so the fact that it didn't normalize until years later is probably unrelated.  So, about the building up.  I used to be so irregular that it wouldn't be uncommon to go for six months without a cycle.  I have no idea if I was ovulating or not.  When the wait was longer than 4 months, I would have a heavier than normal period.  There was just more bleeding than usual, and sometimes it would last a couple of extra days.  I don't know that the cramping was worse than normal, I think I just wasn't used to it any more.  If it did seem worse, it wasn't worse by a lot.  It was never bad enough that I took a day off of work or anything.  HOWEVER: You aren't necessarily ovulating.  Look at the documentation that you got when you first started on depo, fertility isn't expected to return for a year.
TwoXChromosomes X I can attest to "foreplay" being fun as a main course. You can do lots of fun positions. It's a great way for my partner and I to be intimate without worrying about impossible intercourse.
TwoXChromosomes X Although to me, the most important part of breastfeeding is the connection your child has with you during feeds, I would buy commercially available breast milk if it meant that the donors were screened and the milk was "clean".   I wasn't able to breast feed (a combination of a stay in the NICU, low supply, and birth trauma affecting his latch dried me up very quickly) and there is no offical donor program here. Even if I had a way to hook up with a stranger's milk, I wouldn't be comfortable with that without knowing for sure what they are ingesting. My friends with babies aren't close enough that I would be able to ask for some of their milk.   I have no problem with formula - it's food, with a consistant amount of nutrients for him and he's not failing to thrive. But if I could mix feed with some breastmilk, I'd be very happy.
TwoXChromosomes X Many women go through a miscarriage and then go on to have normal pregnancies. It is very unfortunate and sad, but most often it doesn't mean that the woman cannot carry a pregnancy until full term. Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X Goodwill, or even better if there's one around, Goodwill Outlet. You pay for clothing by the pound so it's really cheap. You have to dig through tons of inapplicable/sketchy clothes, but that just adds to the thrill of the hunt!
TwoXChromosomes X I think you might be getting HPV and Herpes confused.  While it is possible to carry HPV forever, it in extremely unlikely; herpes on the other hand is the one that sticks around forever.  For something like 90%-95% of people the body clears the HPV infection within two years; by clears it means gone from your body.  That is why statistics on HPV say "infected with genital HPV at one point in their lives" instead of "are infected".  I even remember reading somewhere that doctors say that if you haven't shown any signs in two years that you probably don't need to tell new partners.  While I am not sure I necessarily support this it seems to me that doctors wouldn't recommend it without it being true for a large proportion of the population.  
TwoXChromosomes X actually no it does not. 60% of all pregnancies are naturally terminated by the body for a variety of reasons. so only 4 of 10 pregnancies actually become viable fetuses. so at conception it's a potential life. it's not until a few months later that it's actually a life.
TwoXChromosomes X tampons don't mean anything to doctors. pads do.  Get the heavy ultra overnight pads and if you fill up one in 2 hrs, go to the hospital.  that's too much bleeding.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; If you're getting a free pregnancy test (available at the drugstore for $5...      To be fair, those are not the same as pregnancy tests administered in a medical clininc.  Home pregnancy tests are urine based and typically suffer from flase negatives more often than blood based tests, mainly due to sensitivity of testing equipment.  Hence, a home pregnancy test can give you a definitive positive, but if it's a question, it is best to see a doctor for a formal blood test.    
BabyBumps X with both of my pregnancies i had horrible hyperemesis gravidarum. from 6 weeks until the day they were born. my first time it was before there was a generic for Zofran and I was uninsured, so they cost $250 for 20 pills, which got me through a week and a half. so.... i rarely had the pills. for the first two trimesters I threw up 10-15 times a day. i could hardly keep anything down. the third trimester it went to about 5-8 times a day. i ended up with IVs for dehydration a few times.   i still managed to gain 25 lbs for that time. the second time i had Zofran the entire time. the few times i went without it i spent the day cooped up in the bathroom puking. Zofran made me feel just a little under the weather instead of death warmed over. it made it possible to function, but i certainly didn't feel great. i only gained 7 lbs the second pregnancy. (so technically **i** lost weight) but i've been having weight loss issues since giving birth too, so theres more to it than just the pregnancy and sickness.    good luck with it all. and try not to worry, that little baby will get everything that they need, whether you can keep it down or not. keep yourself as healthy as you can. take the Zofran and just keep up with your Docs and let them run tests and do extra ultrasounds if it keeps them happy. its always nice to see that little baby growing. 
TwoXChromosomes X My most recent pap was the first one to come back clear since my diagnosis, so I'm still going to be at the six month stage for quite a while.    I think it might go back to once a year after a while, but the way my new doc explained it, once you have HPV, whether it stays in your system or clears out, your chances of cancer are raised for the rest of your life. Period. But that's just how insurance companies see it and since cervical cancer is so slow-growing and so easy to nip in the bud early, it's nothing to worry about, but better safe than sorry.    I can tell you the "getting it to clear up on its own" took years for me, and it felt like I would be "abnormal" forever - but now apparently I'm fine. So some if it depends on how long you've had it, if they're pushing more serious treatment on you, maybe just give it another year, then reconsider. Have you tried [Googling "types of HPV"']( ?q=types+of+hpv&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=&amp;oe=) to see if the "warty" kinds are cancerous? I was generally under the impression that the cancer causing ones don't cause warts (see page 2 of [this link]( -of-hpv.html).)
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks, I appreciate that.  It just seems odd that the one time I've had an abnormal smear is the time that the doctor had a LOT of trouble getting one.  I didn't have any abnormal cells or lesions, just some inflammation--which is why it seemed opssible to me that it was caused from the doctor scraping and prodding a lot.  Every doctor I've seen since told me that the colposcopy was overkill and unnecessary for my situation, but who knows.  the doctor told me she wanted to do it to be safe because of the HPV.  Either way everything has apparently cleared up and I'm good to go now!
TwoXChromosomes X Apparently, there's a male birth control in the process of being approved.   You said you were too young for a vasectomy, but if you don't plan on having children, it's a relatively simple procedure, and many doctors are comfortable doing it on a younger patient. 
BabyBumps X It's already been said a ton, but I totally agree with the advice not to stock up on any one brand. We bought 2 medela and 2 tommy tippy closer to nature bottles. He hated all 4. Bought 2 Avent bottles - love at first suck.   I resisted the paci for the first three weeks, then gave in to the one that came with his steriliser during a three hour crying jag. Instant bliss!!  We experimented with paci brands, and it turns out he prefers the Avent ones (which have awesome glow in the dark handles so you can find them in his crib at night when he loses them).  When my boy has a paci but wants a bottle, he spits out the paci and knits his eyebrows together and wrings his hands in a worried look while making a little "o" with his mouth, like he's picturing what a bottle would feel like in there. We call it his "food face". You'll get to know what your kid's food face looks like very quickly.   Congrats!! 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Are you being an idiot about birth control by not using two types of reliable birth control?   While I agree with your general sentiment of "take a test/ask the doctor" I wouldn't really say that you're an idiot if you aren't using two types of reliable birth control.  I've used just birth control pills when I was in a monogamous and STD-free relationship and I was very careful, never taking the pill more than 10 minutes from the same time, using backup if I took antibiotics, etc. and I felt confident and secure with this.  Birth control pills, IUDs, etc. are meant to be sole birth control methods as long as they're used correctly (not that two would be a bad thing).  I also know a lot of people use condoms and as long as they're very careful to use them correctly, I wouldn't call them an idiot.   
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, discuss with your doctor, but I wouldn't worry too much about it.  BUT tell your partner and make sure that she is getting regular paps.  Not just regular paps but also going to the dentist frequently, since HPV is now linked to oral/throat cancer.  Just in case....
BabyBumps X I am intending to breast feed for at least the first month or two; as it is healthy for me and the baby. After that I have to go back to work so we will be using a combo of breast and bottle. I have heard many different numbers as far as time without pacifiers is concerned. It appears they range anywhere from after the first feeding to as little as possible. 
TwoXChromosomes X Lots of women get headaches or migraines coinciding with their periods, so that could be a factor. This can change as you get older. Getting older does mean your hair may change a bit too as your hormones and body does change over time, but you're still pretty young for that.  Talk to your doctor or specifically go to a clinic that specializes in birth control options. There are lots of different types of hormonal birth control with varying levels and combinations of hormones. I worked at a clinic for a bit and we used to have a chart comparing the hormone levels of all the available brands.  You'll find a chart on this page with info on different symptoms the potential pill issues that might cause them: _choosingapill.htm
TwoXChromosomes X Had a replacement 2 years ago. Went fine. Don't worry.  It took only 2 minutes. The little scar (half of a cm) healed fine. Only a little bruise.  What can happen is that your periods change.I didn't had any in the first period I had my implanon. Now I have them once every 5 months.  Don't worry, be happy.
TwoXChromosomes X the directions on mine say to rotate it 360 when it is 3/4 of the way in, this is to ensure it unfolded and is inserted right. it is weird to do. i hope someone with more experience with them posts their thoughts on this. 
TwoXChromosomes X Good point, and I can see its application in animal ethics and potentially even ai development.  But the problem is we are dealing with something we are considering as human.  If we apply non-human characteristics the whole argument becomes somewhat convoluted.    You do pose a interesting point however given that for organ harvest surgeries on brain dead patients, painkillers aren't used, only muscle relaxants and hemodynamic stabilizers.  Can this treatment be considered inhuman?   
TwoXChromosomes X I just want to say I am SOOOO jealous of you oral sex orgasm havers.  I have only come with oral like 3-4 times and it always involved toys.  I can jump on a dick and get off no problem, but I just can't get there on oral alone.  There I said it.  I am not a freak...just wired different.*sigh*
TwoXChromosomes X I'm the same way. I masturbate if I need to-- like, if I really can't bear not to.   I much prefer partner-induced orgasms. Hell, even the sexual encounters that don't result in an orgasm are more interesting to me than masturbation. /shrug
BabyBumps X I  used to work in a high risk pregnancy clinic and we only did NT tests for people at high risk for the things it catches.  When I went in for my first appointment I was surprised when the doctor tried pushing me to get tested even though I don't have the risk factors and was surprised I declined.  it doesn't really surprise me that your insurance wouldn't cover it.  I also worry sometimes that something could be wrong but try to move past  those thoughts since evening has been going well so far.
BabyBumps X I've never had labor contractions (no babies yet!) but during one period I had cramps that were pretty consistently 5 minutes apart and would start with gradual pain and then swell into what felt like my abdomen (uterus) tensing up like a softball and then it would release. It was like a wave sort of.
TwoXChromosomes X Ahum. Ask your doctor?   You could try it; I think when on the first cycle there's more chance of breakthrough bleeding if you continue taking (active) pills for more than three weeks, but there is also a chance that it works for you.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been waking up cumming for the last couple of nights, i think it's not as intense as actual physical stimulation because, well, there is no actual physical stimulation. I just wake up and i'm cumming. It's always from a sexy dream and then bang my pussy's pulsing and i'm cumming.   I think the awake ones are using the power of brain-fu and physical stimulation-fu, hence the awesomeness. I do wish i could brain cum in waking hours though. 
TwoXChromosomes X I am so sorry for your loss. :(    I once had a miscarriage, although very early. I missed my period, waited a bit, took a test which came up positive, then two weeks later started bleeding. I didn't have as much time to get used to being a mother before I miscarried as you have. 
TwoXChromosomes X Congratulations! Definitely thank your doctor - it will help to keep him encouraged and passionate about his work. They love thank yous and success stories :)  I'm currently waiting for a referral to a good gynaecologist to find out the cause of my dyspareunia. I suspect I have vaginismus or high tone pelvic floor disorder, but I want to get checked out for any other conditions. I may have some nerve discomfort just inside my introitus which doesn't help matters.  I am confident my issues can be sorted out. I've made a lot of vaginal dilation progress just on my own. I can currently dilate 1.2 inches (3cm) :)
TwoXChromosomes X Flushing the tampon is a bad idea. Bad for the plumbing, bad for the maintenance guys who have to pull used tampons out of pipes.  It doesn't take a ton of toilet paper, and it isn't that disgusting. Not as disgusting as fishing them out of a pipe blocked with lady-products.
TwoXChromosomes X When I'm on my period and using pads, I just wrap them up in toilet paper and little plastic grocery store bags (separate from the main toilet trash can) and go throw them out that way. That way they don't hang around in the bathroom *to* smell.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you tried Naproxen? Also, I use the NuvaRing and get very little cramps with it. All birth controls react differently with different women but you could give another type a try if you're willing.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Just because the mark of circumcision is physical does not mean it is more abusive than teaching American boys that only "pansies" cry.  I'm really getting the vibe that you don't understand what female genital mutilation is. It ranges anywhere from removing the clitoral hood to removing the entire clitoris and sewing up the vagina partially so that sex is painful.  And yeah, teaching American boys sexist values is still harmful, though how on EARTH you could claim it is no more abusive than forced surgery without anesthesia or painkillers is beyond me.  If you want to take a 100% subjective take on the world that's your perogative, but I'm curious, does this mean we cannot judge murderers, rapists, and any other crimes?
TwoXChromosomes X What! I've never heard of that happening. Not only is it *not* normal, but also incredibly unethical.   Why not suggest she get her checkup from her GP? You don't need to go to a Gyn for routine pap smear stuff.  (If her GP's a man and she's still uncomfortable, she can request a female doctor or a nurse do it/be in the room.)
TwoXChromosomes X This month I had spotting for about two weeks before my period started, and cramps started about 4 days before my period started. My period also came two days early. I don't know what the fuck happened, but I'm definitely switching pills because that shit shouldn't happen on the pill. I did miss a pill one day, and took two the next, but I've done that before and NEVER had such drastic symptoms from it, and the spotting was a week after I missed my pill. Right now my period is also much heavier than usual and a lot more crampy.  I'm going to my student health center this week to get a new prescription, and I suggest you hit up your health provider, too. Your situation doesn't sound like a good thing, and even if it's medically fine, you don't want to suffer like that before (or even during!) so you should look into switching pills/going on the pill if that would be able to help you.
TwoXChromosomes X I feel your pain-- my ladybits are dying now too (just finished the 4th night of a 7 day monistat treatment) -- and what you're experiencing might be a yeast infection. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just had one last week, and it just feels like a really long (15 minutes) pap smear. I am really small and have had issues with vaginismus in the past, so speculums are incredibly painful for me, so it was a really terrible experience for me. However, it was ONLY the speculum that was painful... I didn't feel the biopsy at all and had no cramps afterward. 
TwoXChromosomes X It took about 6 months from the time I stopped using Depo to my first period, so give it a bit more time. If you're really concerned though, might be worth seeing your doctor. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's normal to have discharge and depending on where you are in your cycle, your discharge changes -ranging from an almost egg white consistency to one a bit thicker and more opaque.   
TwoXChromosomes X The depression was coming on from the nuva ring. Birth control pills can worsen hormone imbalances. My anxiety.isn't related to my pcos, but my pms is, so I've been told. I'm being put on the.birth control to regulate my periods, or to not have them in a safe way so.that I won't be so anxious or moody all the time. I have been taking another cause under consideration, but I dont know what else it could be. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's not that hard to clean an uncut penis. My boyfriend has no problem keeping his member clean. You just pull back the foreskin and clean it. It's the same thing you do when diapering a male infant. Cleanliness is no reason to mutilate a little boy.   I've been with both and I prefer the look of uncut. From my unscientific polling of my male friends it seems like (at least 25ish years ago), circumcision was at a decline.  Right now the only reason that I can see to circumcise would be for decreased risk of HIV infection. In two different randomized studies ([here is one done in South Africa]( )), circumcision provided such a significant protective factor that they stopped the trial at the halfway point because it was unethical to make the other (willing) men wait for their circumcision. At 61% protection, it's as effective as a vaccine would be likely to be.  That said, unless I'm in a location with a high prevalence of HIV, I will not be circumcising any sons of mine.  
TwoXChromosomes X Ovulating?   If you are not on the pill, and are roughly 14  days since the start of your last period, then that's what it could be.  Your discharge becomes viscous and there's more of it.
TwoXChromosomes X I miscarried in mid-November (many years ago) and got pregnant at the end of January. My midwife wanted us to wait longer than a few months but I/we were ready before then. So I would say that it is *possible* to be pregnant already but it is also possible that your body is still getting back to normal. Do you have any other symptoms?
TwoXChromosomes X My IUD experience wasn't painful at all, so you might consider it again. Your gyno can give you an ultrasound to see if your uterus is big enough - i think that's one of the main reasons it's painful. Otherwise, what's an hour of being uncomfortable compared to a week or two of crazy emotional rollercoasters after pregnancy scares?  I have Mirena, btw.
TwoXChromosomes X My IUD really wasn't bad, like a bad period cramp that lasts less then 10 seconds. I would say under a minute of pain for 10 years of no worry is definitely worth it.
Parenting X I kept the formula the hospital gave me for my oldest two boys but declined the free formula when I had my third because I didn't want to break down and give him formula like I did with my first two. One thing I would tell any new mom wanting to breastfeed is to NOT have any formula or bottles in their home. There are times when even the most dedicated new mommies feel like they'll crack and give in to giving their babies formula, and the formula companies know this, which is why they give it away! 
TwoXChromosomes X It looks like everyone has already answered your question. Just for reference, you actually CAN'T get pregnant from precum unless your boyfriend has already cum that day and did not pee before insertion. The pull out method is actually almost as effective as condoms WHEN DONE CORRECTLY- that being said, I'd recommend using another method as your primary version of birth control. Have you considered the pill or an IUD?
TwoXChromosomes X does she hold her pee in when she really needs to go? ...it's terrible for you, and can cause urinary tract infections.
TwoXChromosomes X The best way to prevent UTIs would be to just pee after having sex. It's because bacteria gets into her urethra (cuz ours are shorter) and if you don't pee to get rid of the bacteria, it stays and might even give you a bladder/kidney infection if not treated right. 
TwoXChromosomes X Like the others said, it might not be a bad idea to go to the doctor, but if you've been actively worrying about it like this, that might play a role in it's delay... If you're stressed, it can not only delay your period, but keep it from coming altogether. Take a test to be sure, but otherwise, just relax :)
TwoXChromosomes X Good luck!  It has seriously changed my life.  I was on the pill for about 5 years straight.  I have very few side effects with my Mirena.  I have some slight cramping here and there.  But the best part is that my sex drive came back!
TwoXChromosomes X They... don't remove their uteri.  They tie the fallopian tubes, an entirely reversible procedure.  You're thinking of a hysterectomy, not a tubal ligation.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;They tie the fallopian tubes, an **possibly** reversible procedure  This is a more accurate statement.  Pregnancy rates for women who've had tubal ligation are between about 60% and 75%.  Reversal doesn't always work.
TwoXChromosomes X I had one a couple of years ago.  I miscarried at around 9 weeks, not finding out I had miscarried until there was no heartbeat at the second appointment (first appointment was to confirm pregnancy).  I was having all the usual pregnancy symptoms until AFTER my D&amp;C, so like you I was unaware that there was anything wrong until the ultrasound.  I was worried that I'd never be able to have kids after that, but this past October I gave birth to a wonderful son.  
TwoXChromosomes X You may need to take another course of the fluconazole or similar then continue on acidophilous for a couple months- and always cut sugar out of your diet, including alcohol! And no, the sex thing is not weird at all :)
TwoXChromosomes X My partner's step-sister had one just last year, and had the operation to remove it at around 14 weeks or so.  Her mother and her both said they were surprised at how many people they knew who talked to her afterwards to tell her that it had happened once, twice, even three times to them when they were trying to conceive. She's just recently found out she's pregnant again (yay) so we're all hoping her pregnancy goes smoothly, and she's also feeling cautious and excited about it as it's still early weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X Kind of off topic, but have you ever tried the thing with non-Seasonique/Seasonale pills where you skip the sugar pills and start a new pack right away to make your period only come every few months?
TwoXChromosomes X In general, IUD's are recommended to women who have had children because the os (opening from the cervix into the uterus) is slightly larger and more pliable.  Inserting an IUD into a woman who has not had children is more difficult, as well as more painful.  If you are interested in getting an IUD, and your personal OB/GYN won't do it because you have not had a child, shop around.    I have the Mirena and I love it.  No periods, woo!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;That is just way too intimate for teenagers.  I don't think you're giving teenagers enough credit.  Some kids are ready younger than others.  I had sexual relationships with two girls in high school (one from age 14-16 and another after that) and I don't think anyone has any regrets about when we did what.    Not to mention, oral is a much safer alternative to intercourse.
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, the first step in the process of waste water treatment facilities is getting out stuff like tampons and condoms and undissolved toilet paper.  Although I do agree it's best not to flush them in the first place, but it's not necessarily going to clog up whatever treatment plant your waste water goes to.
TwoXChromosomes X Sperm only last 48 hours so if it was an actual period it's basically impossible (an egg can't develop enough to be released and fertilized that quickly). So basically no chance of being pregnant but you could do one anyway. Probably it's just gastro?
TwoXChromosomes X I prefer pads.  I find tampons uncomfortable because I have an insanely small vagina.  Only the light days ones fit and I can only find them in variety packs.  Even going up to a regular sized tampon is excruciatingly painful for me.
TwoXChromosomes X I personally am very comfortable with tampons but could never get used to the diva cup.  I'd say stick with the tampons for a while.
TwoXChromosomes X congratulations! I completely feel you as tampon insertion/removal was incredibly painful for me the first few years of my period so I never used them. Then I had sex for the first time and it became a breeze. 
TwoXChromosomes X Also, pelvic floor specialists (physiotherapists) can help you stretch and relax your muscles if they are too tight.  I'm going to a women's gynecology clinic next week who specialise in painful sex and have on-site physiotherapists. I asked for a referral through my GP.
TwoXChromosomes X I thought herpes should be really burning and painful instead of itching and mild irritation. 
TwoXChromosomes X You can usually flush tampons, but it isn't usually recommended for older plumbing systems. You cannot flush plastic applicators at all.
TwoXChromosomes X Alarm on your cell phone. Since you aren't on it to prevent pregnancy, it doesn't matter if you're a few hours off. My pill, for example, says take within three hours of the same time every day. Set an alarm and then the next free minute you have, take your pill.
TwoXChromosomes X I've gone through stages of just using condoms, which was when I was with a new partner and we hadn't done STI tests. Condoms are fine if you use them correctly.  You could team a diaphragm or a copper IUD with condoms.
TwoXChromosomes X Condoms are perfectly fine, but it can get expensive. They aren't cheap! Doubling up with that you can use some type of spermicide foam. However, condoms can break-- of course you can get pregnant on the pill too, but if you know you're taking the pill with perfect use it's pretty safe to say you wont get pregnant. If you're planning on being sexually active with the same guy for a while I personally would suggest looking into some other type of BC other the condoms. I also just don't like how condoms feel though. Something like the nuvaring that's places inside of you, hormones are generally centralized because of the location. There is always the Paragurd IUD that has no hormones, but depending on your age/cervix some doctors may not give it to you, but it's worth a shot! 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Fingers during oral are often good, but some women find they actually stop them orgasming by distracting them from other sensations.   This, this, a thousand times this!  I finally figured out a way to explain it to my husband in a way he completely understand.  The strong, immediate pleasure of vaginal stimulation overwhelms the more subtle, building pleasure of clitoral stimulation.    Only when I'm ready to orgasm are fingers a good thing, usually indicated by a loudly screamed "Now, now, oh dear god now!"
TwoXChromosomes X What? If your partner doesn't want to get an abortion, and you don't want to end up with an accidental child, how is it in any way harmful to the pro-choice movement to avoid unwanted conception?  It's almost as if you don't understand that women can make their own decisions about what they want going on in their reproductive systems...
TwoXChromosomes X Although true, the Mirena hormones are only released locally (inutero) so they won't have the same effect as an oral contraceptive or the shot etc.
TwoXChromosomes X Am I completely convinced by this study?  No.  Am I going to avoid HFCS anyway?  Yes.  Look, HFCS may or may not hurt me.  Avoiding HFCS definitely won't hurt me.  The early studies showing smoking was harmful were similarly skimpy.  Just sayin.
TwoXChromosomes X This is exactly how I feel about sex/pregnancy issue.  Maybe this woman is simply someone who if you are going to have sex with puts her beliefs on if she were ever to become pregnant right on the table since in reality abstinence is the only foolproof method of preventing pregnancy.
TwoXChromosomes X I've tried skipping my placebo week, too, and this happens every time. It generally does if its the first time in a row skipping, I find, since your body is used to a certain cycle and you're just confusing it.
TwoXChromosomes X I know a woman who had her first baby at home by HERSELF without waking her husband.  That is way too hardcore for me, and I'm planning a completely natural birth in a birth center with a midwife if I can at all manage it.
Parenting X If you want him to take the bottle, try having mom leave for the day (or at least a few hours) so he's not BFing or even near the source of it.  He will eat from a bottle if he's hungry enough.  You should be the one to give him the bottle since he associates mom with BFing. 
TwoXChromosomes X If your ovulation was on time, then you should get reliable results by a week past your expected period start. A lot of tests brag about having like 75% accuracy on the first "late" day, but that's often before the body has gotten into full swing with the pregnancy hormones that tests detect.  Late ovulation, though, I can't say for sure. Not a doctor or anything, but I would guess within two weeks of actual ovulation, you could trust a negative result. I'm basing this on the time between "typical" ovulation and the "week past due" point when tests claim their highest possible accuracy kicks in.  Sorry to hear you're so worried! :( It must be stressful waiting this out! I've been at that horrible "waiting but not sure a test will work yet" point a couple times, and it sucks pretty hard. Try not to focus on it too much--though I do know that's easier said than done! Big hugs!
TwoXChromosomes X It's sort of the shape and size of 2/3 of a large eggshell and made of silicone or natural rubber.  Mine is "The Keeper" brand, but they also go by "Moon Cup" AND "Diva Cup".  Get one. It will change your life.
TwoXChromosomes X The second period isn't really a period, it's what's known as spotting. It can be quite normal. I had it for years, and I finally got rid of it by going on the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, I guess it hurts me to think about so much because I can't use tampons either. It hurts for me to put in a tampon. As much as I hate the nastiness of pads, I am doomed to use them forever =( I wish I could just wear tampons. But still, a cup?
TwoXChromosomes X I started mid cycle, didn't have any problems except a little spotting, and it took a while to regulate my period again (about 2 1/2 months). but all has been well since then. But like missrebecca said, the bc will NOT be effective against pregnancy unless you've been on it a full month.
TwoXChromosomes X starting mid-cycle is unusual but not unheard of.  as someone with hormonal gut issues too, consider getting your doc's permission to skip the placebos, or go on a pill like Seasonale that is taken continuously.  i find that the gut issues come back even with the fakey pill-periods, so minimizing those by taking the pill continuously is great.  i have 4 periods a year; it's fantastic.
Parenting X I have a midwife who is both a certified nurse midwife and a certified professional midwife :)
TwoXChromosomes X Hi there. I have PCOS, and my diagnosis came from a blood test that confirmed an elevated LH:FSH ratio. I'm not a doctor, but from my research the symptoms you've described can be caused by lots of other things, and I believe generally doctors try to rule those things out before they go to PCOS, and at that they would confirm with a blood test or ultrasound. Personally, I would get a second opinion. Also, regarding the birth control pills, they may help with some symptoms (irregular periods, acne) but they have their own side effects, and if you're not comfortable taking them, you can find other ways to deal with the symptoms.
TwoXChromosomes X Good. Good luck. If 100 couples have sex regularly for one year and always use condoms, 2 couples will get pregnant during that year. 98 couples won't. So condoms are pretty reliable, but you could be the unlucky one...  But probably you are ok.   Getting some good information and perhaps the BC pill will be a good development.
Parenting X Early on, he or she will sleep loads - this will gradually lessen, although you might not notice it, until about four months, at which point you'll realise that they don't seem to sleep ever.  Both our sons (now 27mos and 5mos) started sleeping through at about three months (by which I mean 8pm - 4am) because the wife spent an hour feeding them from 7pm. Both boobs, so they went to bed sated.  With our second son, breast feeding was much harder to establish and even now she doesn't have as much milk available as she did with our first. So we swapped the middle two breastfeeds of the day for bottles of formula - it's worked a charm, and he's still mainly breastfed.  Just some thoughts...
TwoXChromosomes X The cranberry juice-as-cure thing [is a myth]( ).  It may prevent UTIs, but it's not going to cure it.  That said, it wouldn't hurt.  If you want to tough it out, which I really don't recommend from experience because it can spread to your kidneys and that's a much more serious (and painful) problem, get yourself some Azo (or equivalent) at the drugstore.  There are times when antibiotics are warranted.  They are few, but this is one of them.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes but go to a doctor and get treated with antibiotics.   If you don't treat it properly you can get a bladder or kidney infection.  In the meantime take cranberry capsules, Goldenseal and Echenica and Aleve until you get to a doc.
TwoXChromosomes X As some of the others have said, it's honestly best for you to see a doctor if you're able. Having had several UTIs (and attempting, each time, to self-treat), I've finally learned that you can only alleviate the symptoms, not cure the infection. What you need is an antibiotic and perhaps some pain medication. I've let a UTI go and go before...right up to the pissing blood point. Hie thee to a doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X Go to a doctor and take the Cipro. Last time I tried to treat a UTI with juice, I ended up with a horrible kidney infection.  Without treatment, a UTI can spread to your bladder and kidneys, which can eventually [develop into septicemia]( -01-24/world/brazil.amputee.model_1_da-costa-miss-world-pageant-amputations?_s=PM:WORLD). 
TwoXChromosomes X Been on Loestrin 24 for a few years now.  I haven't had much trouble other than if you miss your pill by even a few hours there can be break through bleeding.  It never made me gain weight or get emotional, but it does lower my sex drive a little bit.  I think all pills do that to some extent, though.  My periods are usually two days or less, which is also convenient.  
TwoXChromosomes X Pain is a very poor diagnostic for my wife.  When she was 19 or 20, she had a little pain in the kidneys, but no fever.  Eventually, we went to the hospital and they rules out a kidney infection because people with kidney infection are in so much pain that they cannot walk and she could.  After a urine test and a blood test, they discovered she not only had a kidney infection, she had a very acute one.  They believe she was less than 24 hours away from being fully septic.  And yet, almost no pain.
TwoXChromosomes X They also prefer to do cesarian sections for women who are having twins.  Even if you are attempting a natural birth you will do it in an operating room prepped for a c-section if "necessary".  C-sections are faster for doctors and they also get more money for doctors (since it's surgery) and hospitals (since they collect 3 days worth of exorbitant fees for a three-day stay).  I had twins and though they were healthy and stayed in the room with me the whole time since four hours after birth  I did have a c-section since my doctor preferred it and it was late at night when my water broke and they had suspended my labor for a week.  If I had waited for a natural birth I'd have had a doctor who wasn't my OB-GYN. 
TwoXChromosomes X It depends largely on the type of pill. Progestin-only pills, as Bright_Green said, are much more time-sensitive. The mini-pill is especially time-pressured. Combo-type pills, on the other hand, have a much bigger window. However, you should try to take them within the same time period (within 2 hours for max effectiveness). You should look to see what kind of birth control you're taking before we can be sure, though. 
BabyBumps X Congrats!  Also, as someone else mentioned.  Don't panic if there isn't a heartbeat since they usually can't hear them that early.  My baby is uncooperative and always moving during doctor appointments so I just finally heard it for the first time at 21 weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X Yep, I recently started to take some vitamin supplements and It should have whole day's amount of D in there.
TwoXChromosomes X If you have no pre-existing health conditions that would affect the safety and effectiveness of birth control, and you don't smoke, you're probably fine - talk to your doctor about your concerns.  In particular, ask your doctor about low-dosage pills. Lower doses of hormones = less risk of blood clots, but just as effective. Different dosages work best for different people, so communicating with your doctor is key to getting the best prescription. 
TwoXChromosomes X When I was on the POP I had terrible issues with my period. I had insane amounts of bleeding the first month. It was like a constant 3 week period. I had fewer days of not bleeding than actual bleeding... Once the first month was over with, I had days of light spotting to bleeding and then normal days. Eventually I went into a cycle of bleeding every other week for five to six days at a time. It was very, very annoying! And whenever it was brought up to the doctor they said it was "normal breakthrough bleeding." I found that to be very annoying and hard to believe considering it was so erratic and lasted so long, but I went with it, as I was breastfeeding and had no interest in other birth control (IUDs scare me a little). So for about EIGHT months I bled heavy periods every other week. I can't even begin to tell you how much of an inconvenience that was to me... And by the 9th month I started bleeding every two weeks. Yay, another week free of bleeding! It was at that point that I said "fuck it" with the POP and opted for the regular hormone pill since I was done breastfeeding and hated everything everything the POP was doing to me.    I know it works for some women, but I'm convinced that it's never going to be for me again... When I went to the regular pill I suffered no issues and feel so much better. I felt like the POP was making me moody too. Be on the look out for that. 
TwoXChromosomes X Invest in a diva cup. Say good bye to stained underwear, buying products every month and the worry that you will bleed through. It is also the 'green' way to go. :)   I usually bleed forward like that some too when I can't use a cup or tampon.  It's annoying. 
TwoXChromosomes X I use a Diva Cup and I *still* end up wearing pads half the time because they're more comfortable on lighter days. I need to find something a little less rigid than the Diva Cup, unless I'm having a really heavy flow, it's downright uncomfortable to insert. 
TwoXChromosomes X Well, with the Diva Cup you don't have to change it as often as with tampons.  You can leave it in for up to 12 hours, so theoretically the whole public restroom thing should't be an issue.
TwoXChromosomes X You do not and should not remove it before sex.  My SO is WELLL endowed (hits my cervix too) and sure, he can feel it, but it doesn't cause any problems.
TwoXChromosomes X Has your doctor ruled out endometriosis? I don't know much about it, but I think pelvic pain is the primary symptom...when my doc was asking me about my symptoms she told me sometimes the two can present similar symptoms, but she said it was unlikely I had endo since I don't have pain. Maybe something to look into if you haven't already.
TwoXChromosomes X This happens to me too. ALL THE TIME. I hate wearing pads. I'm a heavy bleeder, too, which just makes everything that much more complicated...pads always seem to leak, no matter what I do. Same with tampons. I buy the super ones because I bleed so heavily, but I still leak. This might sound gross, but I can feel it leaking, so I'll go to change it...even though the tampon isn't "full" if you will, I'm still leaking. Because of this, I absolutely HATE my period. It's seriously 7-8 days of hell.
TwoXChromosomes X get back to a doctor, get prescribed a stronger antifungal. it's possible for yeast to become resistant to the drugs (weaker yeast killed off but small amts are left) so make sure to take all of it.
TwoXChromosomes X I do all the time. Im currently on a new birth control that causes me to have my period for 3 weeks and only one week with out it, therefore I have had quiet a but of period sex lately. Luckily I start a new birth control next week and wont be on my period so much.
TwoXChromosomes X My period was a couple of days late last month, due to stress.  Blood tests can also show whether you're pregnant. It might set your mind at ease if you got one.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah it seems it's different for everyone.  I don't notice any particular emotional change before/after/during my period.  I am on hormonal birth control pills now but even for the 3-4 years I didn't take them, I didn't notice any emotional effects or mood changes. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's a lot easier than giving you oral. If he has a problem with the toy  then he's the problem.   I bet if you use it during coitus, he'd like it.  That has been a recipe for simultaneous orgasms in my experience. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a mild mix of everything and sometimes nothing, I guess.  I occasionally get cramps, I sometimes get a zit or two, I never really get cravings, and I suppose there were a few times I was a little more irritable than usual, although I'm fairly certain they were due to external causes. A consistent change in behavior or mood isn't really noticeable to me, at least.
TwoXChromosomes X I went and looked up the side effects for Alli, just as an example diet drug.  [Are these what you're talking about?]( #Side_effects)  If so, you don't need to panic, but it's a good idea to see a doctor to find out what's going on.  *not a doctor - just a medical nerd*
TwoXChromosomes X When I told my mom I was pregnant (after a horrible miscarriage six months earlier), she said "Oh, I figured."  It takes all kinds. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm only a couple years older (and also virgin) and I just started with mine. Again, make sure you get the smaller size (even though it says it's for light flow) and make sure you have *plenty* of time to figure it out and *relax* the first few times you put it in.  It took me about a half hour on my first try and I was getting sore enough that I was just about to give up. If you get too sore and frustrated just try again later; you'll get it eventually. Also, I highly recommend the "7" fold, the normal "C" fold is too big and cumbersome for me to get in.  When you go to take it out it helps to reach your finger up to break the seal at the top and fold it into a C before taking it out. (Also difficult to do as a virgin, but relax and just put one finger in up the front) Otherwise the suction can be very uncomfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X I see the morning after pill as a 'cure' as it does not actually prevent conception (after all, it's taken after unprotected sex, which may have resulted in pregnancy) but it will stop a pregnancy from progressing.
BabyBumps X We did it every other day basically for the whole month and got lucky on our first month of trying. It's normal for it to take some time though. If you aren't using fertility friend and taking your temps, you should start. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've read that too, although I keep reading about "evaporation lines" and that blue tests are less reliable than pink tests.  Of course, I don't know how legit "PeeOnAStick.com" is. Here's hopin'! 
TwoXChromosomes X You know, depending upon your body and how heavy your flow is, you may not be able to be completely free of pads anyway. On my heaviest days I've always had to wear a pad *with* my tampons. I finally got a Diva Cup, hoping that things would be different...and they aren't as different as I was hoping. On my heaviest days I still have to wear a pad with the Diva Cup. That said, I *do* have a bigger window of time before the overflow starts when I wear the Diva Cup as opposed to tampons. So, it just depends on your body. (Not to mention your comfort level. The Diva Cup takes some getting used to, and if you're not going to feel comfortable with sticking a finger or two in your vagina, the Diva Cup probably isn't going to be a comfortable fit for you.)
TwoXChromosomes X They can't cure them, you're right. Once you've got the UTI, the cranberry juice will only help lessen the pain. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;This is better than banning abortions, correct?  I guess if I had to make the choice, this is better than banning abortions, but who said this is the choice?  Just because it's preferable to making abortions illegal doesn't mean it's right.   Also and I'm just curious here, since you say you "are not for a woman getting multiple abortions" are you saying you personally find them morally wrong or you think they should be restricted/illegal? 
TwoXChromosomes X My first in 1991 was about 12K (c-section). Numbers 2 and 3 were vbac and were 5kish. Four was a forced c-section ("oh, we don't do vbac" even though I'd had 2 successful vbacs) and was up at 15K. My fifth, also a forced c-section, this one early even though I said I don't think the baby is ready, required an 8 day stay in NICU for breathing problems and was up at 40K.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;if my crotch were throbbing, cramping, bleeding, etc.  Just a quick clarification- most of the time one's crotch is not cramping or throbbing. In fact, I have never had my crotch cramp or throb in any way related to my menstrual cycle. The throbbing and cramping is usually concentrated in the abdomen, and sometimes in places like the lower back and thighs. 
TwoXChromosomes X IUDs work on a egg- and sperm-killing level (at least the copper ones) and can be used as an emergency contraception method. It's not recommended to have one if you are pregnant. Then again, there's a &lt;1% chance of getting pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X IUD's are the best form of birth control in my opinion. You don't need to remember to take a pill every day (which can lead you slip ups); if you use the hormonal IUD, your period effects decrease but you get less hormones than in pill/shot/patch form; and it lasts 5-10 years (5 years for hormonal, 10 for copper).
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;where there is conception, there is hope for a full-term birth  Exactly this.  Couples that manage to conceive are already well ahead of the game.  Sadly miscarriage is so common that they won't even run tests until a woman has had three in a row.
TwoXChromosomes X For a lot of people, there's no such thing as letting morals 'get in the way'. He sees abortion as murder. What *wouldn't* you do to try and prevent a murder if you could? 
TwoXChromosomes X I had this happen to me two weeks ago. My period is usually regular, and when it didn't happen, I got worried. (I had cramps and pms for a day, then nothing)  A week later, on time, my period was there. Certainly weird to me. When I told my mom that I did end up getting my period, she responded with "Oh too bad, no grandchild for me" &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  I track my period on my android ovulation calander thing, so I know exactly when to expect it, since I'm not on the pill anymore.  
TwoXChromosomes X Yes!! My mirena expires next year and I was planning on getting the Paragard since it lasts longer and doesn't have hormones. That said, I've had the jawline acne since I had the mirena put in. I only get one zit a month, but they are big and painful. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you are concerned go to the ER or doctor. I had abdominal pain, went to my doctor who didn't think it was an emergency and told me it was probably cysts. Told me I should get a pelvic ultrasound to confirm the next day. It got worse and I went to the ER. Turned out I had appendicitis. I also had some cysts, but they were not the main problem. Basically abdominal pain can be a lot of things ranging in degrees of seriousness.
TwoXChromosomes X In addition, most of the pictures they show are not actually from legal abortions. Most of them are pictures of botched abortions, extremely dangerous third-trimester abortions (not performed in US), etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X As long as you have a female doctor, its really not bad. she will prolly ask questions about you during your exam. Talk back, answer, expand. I talked with my gyno through the whole process about the barn her daughter was taking riding lessons at. I barely even noticed she was done. It is a weird feeling with the equipment, but not painful. you are going to be fine, and comfortable the next time you go. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had my first gyno-type exam with my primary care doctor. I was seeing her for a sexual pain problem, and was very nervous. I wasn't shy though because I was so fed up with my condition. I told her about my problem before the exam and she was very lovely during it. I felt so relaxed and at-ease with her. When we got to the painful part of the internal exam (it's not meant to hurt in normal people) she offered to stop.  Then I got a referral to a urogynecologist and she was also very nice, explaining what she was doing. I did my part by explaining my pain to her. She is going to do a more thorough examination and biopsies under general anesthesia because the way she was touching me isn't meant to hurt normal people at all.  Good luck! My doctor and gyno were both very caring people. If you relax and take deep breaths from your diaphragm it will make any internal exams easier.
TwoXChromosomes X Just breath. They know you're going to be awkward, that's ok. Tell them if you're nervous, it'll help. Every gynaecologist I've seen has been very understanding and pleasant.  At the end of the day all doctors see us in ways other people don't. Doctors have seen my insides, my vomit, my tears. They're there to make you healthy, what's in between your legs isn't anything they think twice about. It's just a part of the body that, like the other parts of the body, sometimes need a little medical care. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Honestly I would ask those who've never faced an unwanted pregnancy at a very bad time to withhold claiming they are anti-abortion until they've had to make that decision.  To be honest I'm not sure anyone with a penis *can* be anti-abortion. What does that mean for a man? That you personally would never get one? That you'd convince anyone you got pregnant not to have one?
TwoXChromosomes X You definitely don't want tit to be "deflated"/flat.  That'll end up making a mess, for sure.  Even the smaller Diva Cup is on the large side compared to other brands on the market though.  As some other posters have suggested, perhaps finding a brand with a different shape/size might be more comfortable for your vagina.  I found this [live journal community]( _cups) awhile back and they have a some comparisons between different brands.   I've personally never had that particular issue.  I've been using mine for about 2.5 years now, and throughout the day, it tends to just get right up by my cervix, and I barely feel that it's in there at all.  A definite improvement over the discomfort from pads and tampons.
TwoXChromosomes X I feel that I am pro-choice and somewhat anti-abortion mostly because of situations like yours.   I don't like the idea of having an abortion myself and most people who've had one struggle and find it a terribly difficult choice. I'd much prefer that we simply avoid people being in that situation. I've had a couple of close calls and consider myself very lucky that I never had to make that choice. I don't think anyone sane *likes* abortion.  However, for those who do have a pregnancy I believe they have every right to end it, and I don't really think they need to justify it beyond 'I don't want a baby'. When it comes down to it, if a woman does not want the child, whatever her reasons, she does not want it.   Someone else judging those reasons won't change the fact that *she does not want it*. To me, forcing her to carry the pregnancy when we have the means to end it with no suffering to the fetus is an act of barbarism.  I think mostly I want to see abortions avoided because of concern for the women themselves than the fetus (and their partners). Problems with poor or no access to proper sex education, contraception and STD screening wreak havoc on people's wellbeing.
TwoXChromosomes X I always thought pro-choice but also against abortions meant to be against abortions being used as a form of birth control and to instead promote contraceptives and education in order to plan a healthy pregnancy and use abortion as a last resort should methods fail or not be available at the time. 
TwoXChromosomes X Do you remember what kind of things you were doing around the time when this started? A new medication for allergies, heart, or depression?  it sounds like urinary retention to me, which would be contributing to your frequent UTIs, with an underlying cause behind the retention (like a stone or neurogenic bladder). There are medications that can treat it, but I wouldn't take anything that's not prescribed.   If you are emptying out around a cup of urine more than 8 times a day, you need to go to see a doctor ASAP.
TwoXChromosomes X there's nothing wrong with my logic at all. the human reproductive system is not very good or efficient. when the egg splits it's only a potential life. i'm more worried &amp; concerned about the here &amp; now and the people who are actually alive than a clump of cells that only has a 40% chance of actually becoming a viable life.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm very careful.  I've always taken the pill within 10-15 minutes of the same time and have never missed a pill.  At least hypothetically if I did, I'd use backup for 7 days, even if my pill says there's a 3 hour window (ortho cyclen).  I wouldn't want to chance something that important.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;whether it's all in my head or if it's something physical  When talking about orgasms, it's almost always a mental thing.  As an example, a good hypnotist can make someone orgasm without touching them.  Purely mental.  edit: On that thought, you might try self hypnosis.  Googling: Self Hypnosis Orgasm turned up some instant hits.
TwoXChromosomes X The reactions to hormonal BC vary by the person taking it. Some women have effects and some don't; it depends on their body. You can read up on the various side effects reported by hormonal BC but the only real way for you to know how it will effect you is to try it. If you're afraid of the effects then you can opt for a non-hormonal route which would be the copper IUD, or a very low dosage of hormonal BC which can be found in pills. Another option my doctor mentioned was that the ring or the Mirena IUD, which do contain hormones but is set in the uterus so it may reduce the chances of side effects (it may, there's no guarantee).  In short: My friend took the pill and it cleared up acne, no other side effects reported. Another friend took the pill and she gained weight and became irritable.   The [Bedsider]( ) can also provide a lot of information about options I haven't touched upon in addition to the ones mentioned.
TwoXChromosomes X TSS is a generalized infection caused, most commonly, by Staphylococcus Aureus, a bacterium that is part of the natural flora of the mouth, the higher respiratory tract and the GI tract of many people. Some people don't carry this bacterium at all.  TSS starts out with feelings of weakness, fatigue, headache, usually red rashes appear that look like sunburns (especially on the arms and legs), high fever and at times these can be accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and disorientation. If you do not get IV broad spectrum antibiotics ASAP you might as well die in no time.  TSS is not a dissolved issue. Usually, even if you have a Staphylococcus Aureus vaginal infection, you will not get TSS because rarely do bacteria go through the gaping uterine lining vessels in the central blood circulation.  However, if your immune system is compromised, or you allow the microbes multiply (blood and secretions are the food, body temperature and moisture adds for the environment, all they need is time) then you are at risk.  I have read about women who forgot their tampons in and I was aghast, but this happens apparently.
TwoXChromosomes X No, there are midwives as a separate, very poorly "regulated" state by state position. They don't have nursing training but are still legally midwives by title. Certified nurse midwives are the ones with a nursing degree and then additional maternal care training, and doulas are non-medical professionals who are more birth coaches. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's the time. It takes a lot more time to have an orgasm through oral sex/clitoral stimulation by hand. You have to relax and enjoy yourself. Getting impatient is the number one way to block yourself from an orgasm. When I rub myself on things, or use things like a back massager it takes way less time. It's almost like I'm physically forcing myself into an orgasm. It's nice, but it's way better when you have one after spending some time just enjoying it, and it makes it so much more gratifying. It's like working on a project and finally finishing it and knowing you did good job. It can take over half an hour, especially if you're new to it. If you're trying to rush and getting frustrated it won't happen. Hopefully your boyfriend will be patient as well. Good luck!
BabyBumps X I lost about 30 lbs in my first trimester.  From that low I only gained about 15 of it back during the pregnancy.  He was a healthy baby.
TwoXChromosomes X Then what _would_ be an example of wasting your time while giving birth? What would be an example of something that is just not feasible? Most women giving birth want less interventions, not more. They only want more time to do it naturally, and less judgement for just waiting.   No offense, but when women are giving birth, the emotional health of the hospital staff is not their highest priority, nor should it be. I'm not saying that they shouldn't be treated with compassion, but I shouldn't be expected to start pitocin that is exceedingly painful and can lead to an emergency C-section just because my doctor is tired or there are a lot of other families at the hospital that night, or even that I'm not proceeding at the clockwork 1 cm an hour. I'm not saying that I don't appreciate the need for interventions, but saying that I should just suck it up and do it for the family down the hall isn't going to do it for me.  
TwoXChromosomes X There are studies that may suggest antibiotics interfer with the absorption of oestrogen/progesterone (the pill), but this isn't fully understood nor very well documented. Due to the fact that the morning-after pill is just a really concentrated oestrogen/progesterone pill, it stands to reason that the antibiotics may interfer with it. Definitely emphasise this to your pharmacist, and see what they advise.   Best wishes; the most comforting thing I can say is that the true chance of pregnancy is actually very low - compounded by the fact that you're bombing your body with hormonal contraceptives, the chance should be very low indeed, antibiotics or not. 
Parenting X &gt; Just breastfeed instead - cheaper, always the right temperature, much more nutritionally balanced for the baby.  Glib shit.  This is not an option for everyone (my wife is physically incapable of producing enough milk to feed our baby) and has nothing to say about the relative benefits of warming, say, pumped breast milk in a warmer vs. in water warmed on the stove.
TwoXChromosomes X Only when he's trying to wipe his sweaty hair on me. :)    I mean, I was under the impression that the boyfriend isn't sitting around being like "Man, your vagina is so leaky, GROSS!" when they're having dinner or something.    Also, when someone says "discharge" I think of something other than the slick clear stuff that occurs when women are turned on.  It usually makes me think of something thicker and/or smellier.    I would be grossed out if my vagina had excessive discharge, too.  But my definition of discharge would imply something isn't right.
TwoXChromosomes X The morning after pill really screwed with my body.  I was absolutely miserable from it for a few days.  Luckily for you, that isn't normal.  You'll probably just feel tired and a little nauseated.
TwoXChromosomes X You might be having an early miscarriage (because of the pain and bleeding). Don't worry too much; there is absolutely nothing you did to cause it and there's also nothing you can do to stop it, if that's what is happening. Also, it doesn't mean that you can't get pregnant again and have a successful pregnancy. Miscarriages happen often and often the women involved go on to have babies.  Have the blood test tomorrow and, I would say, go see a doctor and have an ultrasound to find out what's happening. Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X She isn't being prosecuted for trying to kill herself. She's being prosecuted for trying to murder her fetus. This would effectively set the precedent for treating fetuses as human beings. It is exactly the slipperly slope pro-choicers are saying it is.
Parenting X We had to supplement with formula in the beginning. Our baby was unable to latch and was losing too much weight, and also burning up too many calories trying to feed and getting frustrated. I started pumping to make sure my milk would come in and it was difficult. Then we started giving her pumped breast milk in a bottle.  The hardest was when my MIL came to visit. Normally she is very supportive and great to be around, but she did not understand how hard I was trying and just kept pushing the breast feeding idea, even going so far as to tell me the formula was making my baby sick. Halfway through the visit I was in tears and could not understand why she would rather judge me than help/support me. I found out later she thought she WAS being supportive, and we just had different ideas of what that meant.  People just act so weird about breastfeeding, like if you can't do it you're damaging your child or something. New parents have enough to worry about as it is, so I wish people would either be supportive or keep their thoughts to themselves.  TL;DR - I too have felt judged for not being able to breastfeed, and wish people would be more supportive.
Parenting X Supplementing from the beginning could have caused some of the problems, not only with nipple confusion but with your supply. Pumping can also decrease milk supply, since it is not as efficient as the baby's latch and it sends signals to the breasts to lessen production. Babies are supposed to loose some weight at first, the way you tell if they are getting enough in the beginning is by how much they are peeing and pooping. You shouldn't feel bad about not being able to breast feed, you should feel bad that no one was able to help you be successful. 
TwoXChromosomes X As she should be.  From the article, it appears that the child was viable, and being inside the womb was not imperative to her survival, especially since she was only 1 week from giving birth.  As such, she should be treated as a separate person in the case (from any standpoint).  The mother knew full well by killing herself she would be killing the child, which, in my mind, make her guilty of murder.
TwoXChromosomes X As I said elsewhere, I gave birth to twins at 33 weeks. Those "fetuses" were fully formed babies who flourished and are now healthy vibrant toddlers with no health or cognitive deficiencies.  Killing a "fetus" at 33 weeks is killing a baby.  I'm pro choice but this case was murder.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;The fetus does not necessarily need the body of the woman in order to breathe, a function absolutely critical to mammalian life as we know it. At this point in a pregnancy would that particular debate apply. , the baby was delivered and could survive by itself for 4 days.
TwoXChromosomes X It might be poking your cervix(opening of the uterus). You can probably feel it with your finger, it feels like a tip of  a nose. Cervix can be really sensitive. Remember that your vagina doesn't go straight up so you need to stick the dildo a bit more towards your backside.
TwoXChromosomes X I just had a pelvic exam on Wednesday at my primary doc as part of my annual "women's wellness exam", as they put it.  Go to your PCP. It is almost always the best starting point.
TwoXChromosomes X The reason the pull-out method is considered ineffective is because it can be very difficult for some men to control themselves and get out in time. But if you trust them, and they pull out before the begin ejaculation, the odds of getting pregnant are very low. Not impossible, but like other forms of birth control, they are quite low. (Keep in mind, I'm not a doctor, please do some additional research).  Personally, I know at least 4 women who got pregnant on the pill. I know of 3 women who use pull-out, 2 who use Natural Family Planning, and none of them has gotten pregnant unintentionally.  I had bad experiences with birth control, and used "vaginal contraceptive film" for a while, then eventually switched to pull-out. There are a lot of other options out there if you don't want to take the pill - do plenty of research and talk to your doctor until you settle on what's right for you.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine works very well (I've been on it for 6 years), but I am a bit worried about what the hormones might be doing to my body. Have you considered the copper IUD? I am going to bring it up to my gynecologist the next time I see her. Maybe if you are interested, you can ask yours, too?
TwoXChromosomes X Precisely.  His body, his choice.  My body, my choice.  Isn't it lovely how it all works out?  To me, reciprocation means that if he doesn't go down on me, I don't go down on him.  Sex is a mutually giving act.  Oral is a skewed act, in which one person gives pleasure while the other receives.  Yes, givers receive some pleasure but it's vastly skewed.  I'm not okay always being the one who receives, nor am I okay being the one who always gives.  Oral, to me, should be reciprocal.
TwoXChromosomes X If it is herpes, it might be the oral type, which is just a different strain, but can also show up on the genitals. Something like 80% of Americans carry that virus. Many never have a cold sore, but can still spread it. So that's one thing that can explain how you got it if that's what it is. Also, remember what it is in reality, outside of the stigma. It's a skin rash that is uncomfortable for a few days and then goes away. You would need to practice safe sex, but hopefully you're doing that anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X Ask *specifically* for an IgG Antibody test. That is the best test on the market that is most likely covered. The IgM tests are incredibly unreliable.   They can also do a PCR test, which is a direct DNA text for the virus, but it is very expensive and it generally has to be sent out to a different lab.   Again good luck. Keep us updated if you feel comfortable. Herpes is not a relationship death knell. One of my ex's wife has herpes and they are careful and she's on antivirals. He still is HSV negative.   
TwoXChromosomes X Get a HSV Western Blot test. Those test are 100 percent accurate, and it would be able to tell you for sure, you need to take that test after being exposed for four months after being exposed. The quest diagnostic# is 35435. Good luck!
Parenting X Oh, no doubt. My sister is a perfect example. She scheduled her delivery for a specific date (there was some dumb reason she wanted the date, but I can't remember for the life of me why. It doesn't matter, though; she's a horrible mother.)  My point is more, if there is a risk of something going wrong during the delivery, wouldn't you want to be in a hospital just in case? My daughter was delivered in a hospital and it didn't feel like a "procedure" at all. For about 90% of the time, my wife and I were the only people in the room. It was actually a very peaceful environment.
Parenting X Our first born is only with us courtesy of an emergency c-section. He needed it because his heart rate was falling to pretty much zero with every contraction because his head was stuck (all round failure to progress) and the contractions were clamping down on an artery or similar. We only found out that he was in distress because of the epidural that my wife wanted for pain relief (which I had to kick up a shitfit over because I was told "there's no anaesthetist available" for five hours)... so you could say that I'm pretty biased towards intervention and control when it comes to labour.  Consequently our second boy was born by elective c-section on medical advice. Both lads were born healthy and are thriving.
Parenting X &gt; We only found out that he was in distress because of the epidural that my wife wanted for pain relief  This is known as the "cascade of interventions". When you intervene at all, they need to fix the problems that the first intervention created by doing something else. The c-section would have been much less likely without an epidural. I'm guessing the pain was bad enough to need an epidural because she already had Pitocin or other drugs prior to that.
TwoXChromosomes X Maybe he reacted that way because of the shock. Everyone responds differently. Give it a couple of days, and I'm sure he'll be by your side again supporting you. The thought of raising and supporting a baby is scary at first, afterall. But I'm sure you'll overcome that and see that really, you're blessed. Obviously, we can't really tell you to keep it or not. That's totally your decision. Just take a step back and analyse the situation. You sound like you're in a great, sturdy relationship and mature enough to handle it. And you both want kids so that's a plus! But like I said, your decision.  Congratulations, anyway! Let us know how everything goes! 
Parenting X First off, I'm pretty sure he's saying that they only knew the baby was in distress because of the epidural - because the baby is more closely monitored when you have an epidural than when you don't.   Secondly, as someone who endured 24 hours of back labor before finally deciding to get an epidural, I'm offended at your suggestion that the only reason someone would choose pain relief is because they had a prior intervention. And for the record, the epidural was the only intervention for us, there was no cascade effect.  Also, if a similar comment appears I apologize. I was posting from my mobile and it was acting screwy. 
TwoXChromosomes X That's possible, but you only asked what asexuality may be a symptom of, not which ones in that list would apply to OP. The most obvious one that could apply to her would be a hormonal imbalance and those can be very serious, especially if there's another factor causing it. Either way, she should see a doctor to make sure that it's just who she is, not a disease or a disorder that may be having a serious impact on her health.
BabyBumps X how long did it take for the line to show up on the EPT? if it was past the 10 minutes I would take a first response / Early response test...the blue dye tests sometimes have evap lines that look like a faint positive. If it showed up before the 10 minute mark I would say there is a good chance you have a positive=) good luck!!!
Parenting X HELLP syndrome is a very rare complication of pregnancy. It involves liver failure, kidney failure, and a serious reduction in platlt count that can lead to hemorrhage. The 'cure' for HELLP is delivering the baby.   I had HELLP, I didn't know it until I went in for a routine appointment and was told (at 34 weeks pregnant) that I'd be staying in the hospital for an induction, which turned into a c-section because I'd had zero contractions after 24 hours on various medications.  Before I had my baby, I was a big "natural birth" advocate, though I don't think I would have given birth at home. Now I'm a firm believer that everyone should be within 5-10 minutes of an OR. Things can go south too quickly for birth at home to be worth the risk -- for mom and for baby.
BabyBumps X I caught my pregnancy really early. The urine tests were either all negative or just a very, very faint line. I still thought I was pregnant so I went to the doctor. They had me take another urine test but they said they couldn't determine if it was positive or negative so they took blood. Turned out I was pregnant!  Everyone is different and everyone's body produces different levels of hormones. Sometimes, the urine test just isn't enough.
Parenting X The idea that bringing home a healthy baby negates the trauma of the intervention, and that it is necessary and/or inevitable are the issues that I find most problematic.  The idea that a hospital birth with cascade of intervention and emergency c-section 'saves' the mother and baby is backwards; mother and baby suffer through cascade of intervention, and fathers should be knowledgeable about the process and, most importantly, *be prepared to advocate for their partners and intervene with hospital staff on her behalf*.  Just being in the room and holding hands isn't being a birth partner.
TwoXChromosomes X I got it last month. My boobs are already "grande" so I don't notice a difference there. I am having constant cramps tho and lots of bleeding (some women do for the first few cycles).  
TwoXChromosomes X Not even close to being true!! [Condoms have a 15% typical-use failure rate, while hormonal birth control is about 8%]( _of_birth_control_methods), which means that the pill is almost twice as effective. With perfect usage, condoms have a 2% failure rate and the pill has 0.2%, so in perfect-use scenarios the pill is *ten times as effective*.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never had a condom break in my life.  I think different people's anatomy may play into the likelihood of breaking.  Be sure to use lube, even if you buy lubed condoms.
TwoXChromosomes X pro tip: bring a box of tampons and keep them under the sink for yourself and others who ger their period by suprise or forgot to pack tampons for the day
TwoXChromosomes X The "typical use" failure rate of condoms includes people who didn't use them at all. If you use them properly and *every time,* the failure rate is 2%. [Source]( #In_preventing_pregnancy)  EDIT: Also, we check them after each time, and I have spermicide on hand should we notice anything amiss.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm hormone sensitive too and had Mirena 2 years before I had to have it removed due to hormone complications (sudden breast tumor growths, breast pain, insane cramps, horrid acne, slight weight gain that could not be lost). I actually bled for nearly 2 weeks with each period, and cramped like a motherfucker.  With Paraguard I bleed heavy (normally heavy anyway, so meh) but don't cramp a whole lot, if at all. Cycle lasts normal length.
BabyBumps X I got incredibly sick when I was first pregnant so I didn't notice all the pregnancy signs until about day 4 of being so sick I could barely get out of bed.  Trust me, rest if your body is telling you to do so.  I'm not a person who naps ever and I found myself napping frequently during the first trimester.  The second trimester has been pretty good but I can feel the tiredness kicking in again as I approach the third.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah - the only reason I get yearly exams is because they won't keep renewing my BC if I don't, I find them extremely anxiety provoking and all together horrible. I am sure many women have had cancer detected earlier by being in a similar situation. 
TwoXChromosomes X It took me awhile and I was a master masturbator too. I guess it took about a year or so to figure it out. It  took awhile to relax enough and to figure out what I needed to do with my body while with another body to make it do what I needed to have an orgasm. I already knew how to have an orgasm alone so I knew what physical sensations and queues to pay attention to but adding in the novelty of actually having sex and not knowing how to use another persons body yet, it took some time. And even after I learned how to orgasm with *a* man, I'd go through an adjustment period with each new partner. I'm almost 30 now and experienced and comfortable enough to have an orgasm the first time that I have sex with someone, so don't feel like you're failing for not being able to at 19 with a new partner. 
TwoXChromosomes X You're going to measure bigger earlier with your second pregnancy.  As for the test being super dark and testing early and early symptoms and stuff: it's possible you just ovulated earlier than you think.  It's very unlikely they missed twins at an 8 week ultrasound.
TwoXChromosomes X Despite all the herp and derp going on about abortion rights being degraded the majority of the article is talking about third trimester pregnancies where the fetus or in one case child were killed.  These are the same conditions where if someone murdered the pregnant woman they would be charged with two counts of homicide.  There are no existing rights being eroded.  It was already not allowed to get third trimester abortions.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah that happens, it takes your body a long time to get used to it. I'd say switch to a pill with more hormones in it if you want to stick with that method. It'll still take a couple months for you to get fully adjusted to constant hormones no matter what you use. I had the same issue with the depo shot with three months of a period. But surprisingly when I got on the mirena IUD, I still spotted, but not nearly as much as I did when I was on the pill or the shot.  
TwoXChromosomes X I just wish I could use any birth control that includes estrogen too and not just progestin to stop this annoying bleeding. It's not just mere spotting either. I didn't have any bad side effects from the three other bc methods I've used(Yasmin, Nuvaring, Evra-patch), okay maybe some mood changes, but I just happen to have migraines with aura so non of these are possible.
TwoXChromosomes X I think implanon would probably cause you bleed more since its only progestin. Some doctors suggest that you try first minipill to see how implanon would suit you. I haven't had any spotting with all three methods that included estrogen but almost continuous bleeding with minipill
TwoXChromosomes X I am on my second iud - don't know what it's called but it's the copper kind without any hormones. The first one was pre-baby, the second after giving birth and the first time it was horribly painful during the insertion and a couple hours of cramping afterwards but after that I really never had any issues. The second time wasn't nearly as bad. I was warned by a family member of increased leg cramping during periods but she has far worse cramping than I ever did so it's pretty minor. Would never go back on the pill. Good luck :)
TwoXChromosomes X Hehe. I've been on the Depo shot for over three years and I love it. No periods, no cramps, no side-effects.  But I think the Mirena is a better option due to the very low dose of hormones. I'm going to switch to that when I can.
TwoXChromosomes X If you skip the blank cycle, you can't start at week 1 of the next one - you're supposed to start the next pack's week 3 and then work your way back to week 1.   The reason is pretty simple: most hormonal birth control pills have a different amount of hormone each week (that's one of the reasons some companies color each week's pills differently.  So week 1 would have the lowest dose, week 2 a little more, and week 3 the highest dose; that way your body gets a clear "I'M NOT PREGNANT" signal when you drop down to the sugar pills for the off-week. Now, if you go from the high-dose week 3 to the low-dose week 1, your body still thinks that there is a rapid drop in hormones so it will initiate the menstrual cycle; however, there is still enough hormone from week 1 to confuse the issue, hence the protracted bleeding.  [Edit] Forgot to mention - if you do this, you'll (ideally) need to skip the second month's sugar pills as well. So you'll be taking weeks 1-3, then 3-1, then 1-3 again, and at that point you will resume your usual routine. Again, that's so you have a clear-cut high-hormone / no hormone division to avoid confusing your body.
TwoXChromosomes X It probably depends on the type you're using - I was always on Ortho Tri-Cyclen, so the name itself is pretty descriptive.... Don't know what to tell you then - could just be that your body doesn't like hormonal birth control =( 
BabyBumps X I was hardly sick at all in my first trimester.  I was nauseous a few times but rarely threw up.  Just count your blessings haha, I did!
TwoXChromosomes X My SO has endometriosis, and apparently missing whole cycles is a common symptom. Despite being on BC hormone pills (to help control the symptoms), the first time she missed a whole cycle was still an exercise of willpower to not freak out for me ;)
TwoXChromosomes X I had a "surprise" pregnancy with my son, because I'd been told I wouldn't be able to have children. To make matters worse, when things started to get...less than right in that direction, I went to the GYN who *told me I wasn't pregnant*. **TWICE**. I was at the beginning of my second trimester before anyone could tell me that I was pregnant. surprise!
TwoXChromosomes X Not me personally, but a friend of mine got pregnant at 15/16 (can't remember which) while on the pill (taking it correctly, too!) and they used a condom.  Freaked me out enough to not have sex for a few more years, that's for damn sure.
TwoXChromosomes X Just a little info, patches and injections have a significantly higher risk of stroke than other forms of birth control (even hormonal) because they deliver a high dose of meds directly to your blood stream.. not that its a "high" risk, but IUD? condoms? 
TwoXChromosomes X I've tried to compare it to their balls being squeezed over and over, but then, I have no idea what that feels like so....  maybe insanely bad digestion?  And the only remedy that ever works for me is the green - I like that I can still feel what's happening inside my body(can't with painkillers), but it doesn't hurt (usually) and if I need to, it's easier to fall asleep.  Being doubled over or in the fetal position, kneading and pushing on my stomach also helps.
TwoXChromosomes X XY here.  You always describe them as cramps.  Are they comparable to being out of shape, running for a long time and then cramping up?  Like that sharp pain that runs along near the bottom of your lungs, just lower?
TwoXChromosomes X I think they're different for everyone but for me it's never a sharp pain, more like a dull ache (almost headache-y) feeling which I sometimes confuse with a stomachache.  I always feel like "cramps" doesn't describe my experience, but maybe for some the term works. 
TwoXChromosomes X Better yet lay on your back and spoon in (or use a syringe if you have one) plain natural yogurt, as much as you can fit, about 3x a day and it'll cure a persistent yeast infection in 1-2 days. 
TwoXChromosomes X Can someone explain why you would want a midwife instead of an OB/GYN delivering your baby?  Wouldn't you rather be in a hospital?  Do midwives give epidurals?  I would think that given the chances of something going wrong, you would want to be in a hospital when it happens.
TwoXChromosomes X LAY midwifery is illegal. Lay midwifery/direct-entry midwifery is essentially midwifery learned through apprenticeship rather than formalized schooling.  Nurse midwifery isn't illegal anywhere.
TwoXChromosomes X Progestorone didn't work for me. I have BPES and haven't had a normal period since I was 16. They became sporadic for a about 5-6 years until I just quit having them at all. Now it is a landmark occasion when I have a period.  
TwoXChromosomes X Why isn't the Depo right for you? Weight gain? Depression?  I really wish you the best of luck with your IUD :) Get well soon!
TwoXChromosomes X If you want a 'mean time' alternative to the pill, what about a non-hormonal iud? I got one recently and am loving it. Mine is good for 10 years, but some are for 5, and they can be easily removed by your doc when and if you wanted to try for number 3.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes! I was going to suggest this. It's no use trying to orgasm if you're not even sure how to get turned on or to the point where you want to orgasm or even masturbate.  I would suggest watching porn and trying a vibrator and liberal amounts of lube.
Parenting X Chap stick and hair ties. FOR SURE.  I also loved having my laptop, like everyone else, and the camera. We brought some DVDs too, which helped pass the time for hubs. It was nice to have my own PJs too- makes you feel like a human. But honestly, the hospital should give you everything you need. I was there for an entire week- they had ample amounts of pads, breast pads, disposable underwear, soap and shampoo (for me and hubs), slipper socks, paper and pencils... pretty much everything I needed. I understand wanting to have your own things and the hospital's things are on the lower quality end... But if you're anything like we were, we saved some money by using theirs. Also, I didn't really want too much of my own stuff in the hospital- I wanted to keep it home and clean :-)
TwoXChromosomes X What the above poster said is not entirely true. Some people have issues with break through bleeding but others do not. I personally do not get break through bleeding every month at all. I do get breakthrough bleeding after about 3 months though, so that's when I plan it to have my period. I have 4 periods a year :) Try it to see if it works for you, you will find birth control even more amazing.   Edit: I think the above poster might have meant instead of taking the placebo pills, she takes nothing for those 7 days. I was referring to skipping the placebo pills and continuing straight onto the regular hormone pills.
TwoXChromosomes X Guns and frying pans can also both be used as weapons.  Things that seem different on the surface can sometimes serve a similar purpose, you just have to be willing to examine them from different perspectives.  What about the removal of the clitoral hood, one of the most common types of FGM.  That is so comparable to male circumcision as to almost be the same thing.  And boy babies don't have any anaesthetic when they're snipped, either.  I want to make sure we're clear here...I'm totally opposed to the mutilation of anyone's genitals (and that's why my boy is not circumcised).  However, I'm not going to go around saying that we're so much better here in the West.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Guns and frying pans can also both be used as weapons. Things that seem different on the surface can sometimes serve a similar purpose, you just have to be willing to examine them from different perspectives.  xD, this is the philosophy of modern feminism.  &gt;What about the removal of the clitoral hood, one of the most common types of FGM. That is so comparable to male circumcision as to almost be the same thing. And boy babies don't have any anaesthetic when they're snipped, either.  What about it?   You are arguing that plastic surgery in the West is comparable to female circumcision in Africa or other regions and therefore the West is no better than other places. I have shown that they are fundamentally different.
TwoXChromosomes X You should wait to have sex AT LEAST a month to two months after starting the pill.   That aside, sometimes it takes a couple months (or several) for your body to get used to the fact that you're putting more hormones into your system. Stress is another factor that can really screw up periods: my sister was on the pill and her stress levels made it irregular anyway.  If you're worried about pregnancy, then get two tests, take them both. If even one of them is positive go see a doctor for blood tests.
TwoXChromosomes X Hooray for breastfeeding! I felt awful and fat after I gave birth, and thought I would never look like myself again. Then, at 6 months pp, the weight really suddenly fell off. It's been over a year now (and still breastfeeding) and I weigh 15 lbs less than before I got pregnant!  Edit: You could try seeing if there is a Baby Boot Camp in your city as well. Really fun workouts you do with your kid, and you get to meet other moms too.
TwoXChromosomes X Fiance here.  We ruled out the vasectomy after even the wikipedia page made it clear that only 50-70 percent of men who have them reversed are successful in impregnation attempts.  Not only that, the reversal surgery isn't covered by insurance and would cost around $10,000.  I'd be happy to have kids, but don't have any sense of "need" in regards to having kids.  The thing is we really don't want any for at least another 5 years.  TL;DR - Reversible vasectomies are sometimes an oxymoron.  If there was effective male birth control, I'd be all over it. 
TwoXChromosomes X For some people, the pill can lower your sex drive, increase risk of depression, but it also lessens the effects of PMS.  The pill is great cause it helped give women control over their own destiny, but, it's really not for everyone. 
TwoXChromosomes X It varies because there are lots of ladies on 2X who say they've never had trouble with cramping on their IUD.     I used to get terribly bad cramps before I went on BC, and I would say the cramps I get on my IUD are not as bad, but they're... different. I'm not sure how to describe it.     They definitely are on a schedule, they always happen right at 1pm for 2 or 3 days and I can hardly stand up until I've taken 800 mg of ibuprofen and let it sink in. Once the painkillers get going, I'm perfectly fine for the rest of the day.    The good news is that they're very manageable for me. The bad news is that they happen in the first place.
TwoXChromosomes X Look at the amount of unintentional pregnancies!  &gt;Forty percent of pregnancies among white women, 69% among blacks and 54% among Hispanics are unintended.  Why is that? Is birth control hard to get? Is it that horrible to take any form? I know condoms break and contraceptives fail some times, but that seems a bit high even for that. I know people have a free choice and some don't feel comfortable with contraceptives, but there's so many options to help prevent unintended pregnancies. Why do women do this to themselves (outside of cases where they have no choice)? 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm nowhere close to considering kids yet, but my sister-in-law is currently on her 2nd pregnancy and I keep considering all the things she's done, and is doing, for my pregnancy one day.  I know I don't want an epidural, and I'm almost certain I would like a water birth. She goes straight to the hospital, induces birth, and drugs up.  For me, this just doesn't seem right. I want something a little slower and more natural.  It seems like the tradition is to go to the hospital, spit the kid out and get it over with. I just want something a little more....I dunno....Considerate? Loving?   If you have any more info/advice, dish it out. I am so glad that I'm a woman and I get to experience child birth. I think it's so fascinating and I haven't really had the chance to experience it. I'm an only child and so are both of my parents, so I've never seen siblings/cousins born.
TwoXChromosomes X We are talking about condoms and sex here not needles or blood transfusion.   Condoms. STD's. You get sexually transmitted diseases from having sexual activity.  Open up another fucking window. Look this shit up: _transmitted_disease
TwoXChromosomes X Do standard STD tests detect herpes?
TwoXChromosomes X You'll be ok! I promise. I've been through this, and I know a lot of other women have too. In my case, I had spotting with no true period while on the pill. After freaking out because I'm normally regular, I took a few tests (too many, really) and I wasn't pregnant. Chances are that you're not pregnant and even if you are, you have choices.  As crayones said, keep everything in small, digestible steps. Step 1 - wait to get the test, Step 2 -take the test, Step 3... etc.   You asked about condom failure rates and this is the info I have. If condoms are your only form of contraception, the failure rate for perfect use is 2%. The failure rate for typical use is 15%. You and your partner seem knowledgeable about condom use, so your failure rate may lie between 2% and 15%.  I don't know where you live, but you could always call Planned Parenthood's counseling hotline to speak with someone. [This]( -health-hotline-11510.htm) is the page with info about calling. It's located in MA, but often takes out of state calls. Anyone you speak with can help you understand your risk or make a plan for yourself if you are in fact pregnant. They're good people, I promise!
BabyBumps X A glass of wine is perfectly acceptable during pregnancy.  It's best if you avoid it as much as possible during the first trimester, but one glass even as often as once a week will not give your baby fetal alcohol syndrome.  As other posters have commented, it is common for people in Europe to have some form of alcohol with every meal.  The thought of giving it up for the entire pregnancy is just ridiculous to them.   I've enjoyed a beer or a glass of wine here and there during my pregnancy, and everything looks good so far.  My OB knows about it and she has no issues with this.  Enjoy it!
TwoXChromosomes X I think this highlights the fundamental problem with arguments regarding abortion--pro-lifers are totally justified in their argument *because they think that fetuses are people*. If you thought a fetus was a person, you'd be pretty ticked off too. There's no way to justify an abortion to a person who equates the ball of cells with a person. 
TwoXChromosomes X Wear what you want: they'll have you undress and put on a super fashionable paper gown.  My exams are in the winter so I always have socks on when I go and they're the only article of clothing I keep on - none of my gynecologist have complained yet.  The most important thing you should know is that the exam will be over before you know it. Even for my first visit, I couldn't believe how quick it was. They'll do a breast exam first, then they'll do the pelvic exam. They'll use the speculum to do this - for my first visit, my doctor used the smallest one she had available, since I was new to it. It doesn't really hurt, it's just kind of cold, gooey (from the lubricant) and a bit uncomfortable. It pinches but it's not a burny, stingy pain.  And don't freak out about a stranger checking your breasts and examining your lady parts. I was nervous when I first went in but I told myself that my doctor had seen it all and that I was just another patient. The worst part is not knowing exactly what it'll be like. Once it's over, you'll probably think it wasn't that bad. It certainly is easier the next visit.
TwoXChromosomes X No, it won't be, but a good doctor will realise that your first exam will be nerve-racking and will put you at ease.
TwoXChromosomes X Good on you! I just had my first pap test this week and got my normal result back today :) But I got it done under general, so I can't give you first-hand advice on what it should feel like.  In my country, you can keep a loose skirt on during your exam, and the doctor talks to you first while you are fully dressed. We don't use stirrups and instead allow the legs to flop open in a frog-legged pose. I think the customs in the US are different, involving the paper gown and stirrups. If they use stirrups, scooch your butt all the way down until it is at the end of the table, or hangs off a little bit.  Wear long socks to keep your legs and feet warm, and make you feel less exposed.  Tell the doctor it is your first exam and that you are nervous.  The exam is not meant to hurt, so tell your doctor what you are feeling and how bad it is if it does. You can ask them to stop at any time. You are in charge.  Breathe deeply from your diaphragm as the doctor inserts the speculum. This helps relax your pelvic muscles.  Bring a panty liner to wear after your pap/smear test, as it causes light spotting for a lot of women. The spotting should clear up in 24 hours.
TwoXChromosomes X Depending on your doctor, all of mine do this (I go to a practice of several doctors), they may also insert a finger into your anus and vagina and feel the wall between your rectum and vagina to make sure everything is okay there as well.
BabyBumps X funny thing, I just looked up symptoms of GD and they are basically symptoms of pregnancy, lol. Top 3 are: Excessive thirst, increased urination, and fatigue.   I guess the test is the only way to tell.
TwoXChromosomes X I had Implanon inserted a little less than 2 years ago and I would highly recommend it :)  The only issue I ever experienced was that it took a long time for my body to 'adjust'. By that, I mean ... [**and this may be TMI**] the first four months *sucked* because I had 3 weeks of period and 1 week off. Not to mention that every time I had sex I bled like crazy :\ After four months it did settle down, however, and now I have a period once every month or two and it's so light it's almost unnoticeable - I could probably go about 36 hours before a regular tampon would need replacing (not that you should leave one in that long O_O).   Aside from the issue above, I've never had any problems with Implanon, BUT... As a disclaimer, my body is usually pretty good with birth control (the pill doesn't have any side effects at all for me), so I may just be lucky...
TwoXChromosomes X Assuming I'm going to have unprotected sex with someone I'm not in an exclusive relationship with, then yes, they can be bad. However, if you know that both parties are STD free I don't see why a spermicide shouldn't be added as pregnancy prevention (unless you have a bad reaction to it).
TwoXChromosomes X If you find that the overnights are too gross, try the Always Infinity overnight pads. I used to have the flow from hell and always use these because they're such a mess saver and absorb EVERYTHING. Plus they don't take up too much space, so instead of 3-4 regular overnight pads, you can fit in like 10. Not even joking.
TwoXChromosomes X I had Mirena for 2.5 years (removed for hormone complications) and I'm about a year and a half in with my Paraguard.  MY EXPERIENCE.  &gt;Cramping  **Paraguard** - one day of heavy cramping. **Mirena** - Three days of heavy cramping, one of which was debilitating.  &gt;Bleeding  **Paraguard** - Floodgates opened. Normally heavy bleeder anyway, so this just meant more tampons. **Mirena** - Bleeding was slightly lighter, but not much.  &gt;Period Length  **Paraguard** - No change, about 6 days bleeding. **Mirena** - LONGER PERIOD. Seriously, my periods lasted 10-12 days, and the last 6 of them were aggravatingly light. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've always slept with just pads. I've never had a real issue, sometimes I'd get a little bit on my underwear but nothing to want to change my ways. Always Infinity pads are so awesome, they absorb everything and since switching I could probably wear one overnight Infinity for 24 hours and it still absorb everything (not that I would!).
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, I would say to use backup. I had a little snafu where my ring was out for about 27 hours (forgot to put it back in after sex) and then was taking antibiotics. Just to be safe we've used condoms for an entire month so my body can re-acclimate for sure to the hormones. Think of how you'll feel when it's time to wait for your period and ask yourself if it's worth the stress of wondering if you're pregnant. No! :) Backup for sure.
TwoXChromosomes X I also suggest using Playtex sport tampons. The applicators are plastic and much easier to insert than cardboard which I don't like so well. It will cost a tiny bit more, but to me my own comfort is important and it's always worth it in the end.
TwoXChromosomes X I do take a multi daily as well as some others. The one she takes is pretty complete, Vit A,C,D,E,K,B-1 and 6. It has most everything that my multi does, just more Folic Acid, Iron and Calcium than my multi. It also contains Iodine which mine does not.  
TwoXChromosomes X Garlic doesn't burn the tongue/throat unless it is cut or has a small nick in it when a clove is swallowed whole, so I assume it would be the same when jammed up the vag.
TwoXChromosomes X From what I understand, the same doctor responsible for the insertion is supposed to measure your uterus before inserting the IUD to make sure that your uterus isn't too small for it. This is what my doctor did right before inserting my IUD, and it HURT! Probably more than the actual insertion, actually. (I've never had kids.)  I was still able to get the IUD, though. I had some really terrible cramps for the first week and up to a month afterward, but it's been about six months since then, and now I'm perfectly happy with my IUD. But yeah, tl;dr they're supposed to measure your uterus first before placing the IUD.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, I did have long periods before I started messing with them with birth control, and I had heard that you can bleed for a while after getting the IUD (particularly the Mirena due to the progesterone) put in. And I called the CNMs to make sure. It's like, your uterus knows there's a foreign object in there and it's trying to get rid of it, which is actually kind of comforting to me: my body is working properly. I just wish I could have sex.
BabyBumps X I am totally ready. I keep thinking little things are the start of labor, but nothing yet. My doctor told me today that I might not make it to my next week's appointment with her but I'm not getting my hopes up. Well see. Good luck to you!
TwoXChromosomes X Most of the problems are associated with older (read: 1980s and before!!) models. It's too bad that the stigma persists, because the newer versions have been safe for more than 20 years and they are much, much more effective than condoms and have far fewer side effects than hormonal birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X I've slept with tampons in since i was 12. My flow has gotten so light that I have been able to take out my diva cup and just wear a liner until i get up now.   Pads suck. Lol 
TwoXChromosomes X Your doctor will ask you questions to determine the best pill for you.  Everybody is different but unfortunately you are more than likely to get spotting if you're only a month or so in. Just ensure you take the pill at the same time *every day* and when you get to the 7 gummy pills, skip and start on the next packet.   Also bring some tampons with you for backup :)
TwoXChromosomes X For the first few months you're supposed to get your body used to completely changing your hormones with the pill. That being said, ideally you wouldn't use the two packs just yet since you'd just be starting. Additionally, your body doesn't fully "adjust" to the pill for about three months which means you could be prescribed a pill that your body may not "like" thus potentially causing spotting etc. which could make your trip even more miserable. I went through 3 or so different pills within a short period of time because my body was going apeshit on different prescriptions. I'm also 19 and have been on the pill since freshman year of high school (14)- as a result, I really recommend talking to your doctor and considering waiting starting the pill till after your trip and just using tampons if possible. It's probably your safest and most effective bet.
TwoXChromosomes X I have Paraguard and I bleed heavier but I don't cramp nearly as bad as I used to. Cycle length remains the same.  When I was on Mirena it lasted 12 days and cramps were unbearable :(
TwoXChromosomes X I also imagine this technique would be incompatible with IUDs.  That aaaaand sticking something through the cervix isn't pleasant, and doing that every month just doesn't seem reasonable. The "straw" sized tube they used is basically the same used to insert an IUD (or so I'd imagine) and getting that in was not so fun.

TwoXChromosomes X Dollar Store!  They are actually more accurate than the early ones...If you get a positive there and want confirmation, get a digital read-out one.  That way, there no "Is it a line?"  doubt.
BabyBumps X I'm at that point now where I'll see the kick out of the corner of my eye (about 22 weeks).  For me the first actual movements where I differentiated baby from gas etc, it felt like a twitch.  You know when your eye twitches involuntarily? Like that, but your belly.  It's so exciting!
TwoXChromosomes X Factor V Leiden? I tested negative, but my sister is positive. I do have hyperhomocysteinemia so my doc doesn't want to put me on BC for that either. Seriously- blood clotting disorders are scary- if your family has ANY history, talk to your doc.
TwoXChromosomes X Forever21, Charlotte Russe, Tilly's (a bit more expensive but I browse the clearance a lot.), Wet Seal is ok, but their shirts seem to be made really thin so I quit buying shirts there. I just ordered a nice load from Charlotte Russe. Everything is REALLY nice there, but the size 9 shoes I got were REALLY off. They look like a size 4. I need to return those.  OH and Agaci! I bought a bit from there recently, waiting for it to come in. I freaking love that store so far.
TwoXChromosomes X It's medical grade silicone.  You can boil it between cycles to sanitize it. Tampons and pads are not sterile.  A menstrual cup can be.  I know I had to get over the "ick" factor myself in order to try it.  But after 3 different friends of mine raved about it, I had to see what the big deal was all about.
TwoXChromosomes X Then adoption would be a great choice. As someone said above, its pretty easy to find a family that will pay for everything. But talk it out, decide what you two could live with. Will it be easier on you to just never have the baby or give it up? Only you two can answer that.
TwoXChromosomes X That's very frustrating - I used to have that problem a lot in the beginning.  Part of the problem is that the holes on mine were either not punched through all the way or they were quickly clogged when I first used it.  Have you tried using a toothpick to make sure the holes are clear?  The other part was just technique, and my technique got better with more practice.  The punch down fold worked MUCH better for me than the C fold that were in the instructions for my Diva cup.
TwoXChromosomes X I've used both.  I had the Diva Cup first.  All menstrual cups are similar.  From the discussions at the menstrual cup group on Livejournal, it appeared that Diva Cup, while most widely available in the US and most common, was actually the least favorite.  It has the smallest holes of all the cups, and it's the longest.  So some women it doesn't fit (although it fit me fine) due to the length.  It's not as easy to clean due to the tiny holes, and that also affects the suction - my Diva cup was harder to get to pop open.  I think my learning curve would have been shorter had I started with Lunette right away rather than using Diva for 3 years before getting curious to try another kind.  My sister started with Diva also but then switched to Mooncup.  She prefers Mooncup to Diva.  As much as I loved my Diva cup, I love my Lunette a lot more. I keep the Lunette in my purse and my Diva is my backup that's in the drawer of my bathroom at home.  Whenever I'm stuck using the Diva I'm reminded what a pain it is to insert, get to pop open, and to clean those stupid little holes and how it looks dirtier because of the raised text/lines on the inside.  Oh, and the Lunette is easier to remove, as the ridges give great grip!  At that time I bought it, Lunette had the highest capacity of all the cups on the market (not sure if that's still the case as now there are more than 8 brands on the market) and that's part of why I chose it.
TwoXChromosomes X The price varies but is usually around $400.  **I got my first IUD when I was 17 and I do not have kids**. I'm hormone sensitive and my doctor took this into account when I asked her about birth control options. Most gynos won't consider putting an IUD in someone so young, especially if they haven't had a kid yet, but it's all because of medical stigmas that no longer apply.   I would talk with your general physician first in detail to get a good recommendation from him/her.
BabyBumps X I'm 8 weeks and have had cramps off and on since about week 4. I had my first ultrasound today and everything looks great! I was told that it is normal to have period-like cramping in the first trimester as the uterus expands to make room for the little one. Also, I was told to expect more intense pulling/pinching pain on the sides of my lower abdomen in the second trimester as the uterus starts pulling on the ligaments that support it. GOOD LUCK!
TwoXChromosomes X Based on the law classes I've taken, this definition is the one we use in the US:  "Assault is the act of intentional and voluntary causing of reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact.  Actual physical contact is not necessary in assualt, rather assault needs only intent."  "Assault and battery are sometimes used interchangeably, but battery is an unjustified harmful or offensive touching of another." , he didn't touch her.  He may have attempted to do something and failed, or he may have only said something threatening, but he if he merely assaulted her, he never made contact.
TwoXChromosomes X Since this is something that has come up in the discussion this is what I found on what counts as assault in Texas:  Under the criminal laws of Texas, assault can be charged if you:  1. Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause bodily injury to someone else, including your spouse.  2. Intentionally or knowingly threaten someone else, including your spouse, with imminent bodily injury.  **3. Intentionally or knowingly cause physical contact with another when the person knows or should reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative.** 
TwoXChromosomes X Arrghh, I've done the research, I know the side effects and risks, it's my body why do doctors have to be so difficult about giving women what is such a great BC option?! Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait/call and see. Thanks.
TwoXChromosomes X You're probably tired of hearing this if you've spent much time around here,  but consider trying a menstrual cup.   They're way more comfy than tampons/pads/liners and you can wear them even when you don't have your period.  They're fantastic for spotting or days when you suspect you'll be getting your period, but haven't started yet.
BabyBumps X Next week you should be getting the first doppler. If there's a heartbeat, the chance of miscarriage is less than 5%.   Source: Midwife told us today when we saw the first heartbeat.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes. The term for this is a chemical pregnancy or a missed miscarriage and they occur in very early pregnancy before the 6th week. Sadly there is no way to really know what happened. In the future you may want to inform your Dr's that you may have had a chemical pregnancy but don't be offended if they just brush it off. Most Dr's tend to do this with miscarriages unless you had a D&amp;C.
TwoXChromosomes X The new U by Kotex liners are super nice. I used some Always liners previously and I HATED them, they were itchy and felt coarse and were just no fun. The kotex ones are amazing. They're mostly adhesive so they move with you, but the small amount of actual liner is so absorbent and soft. I love them. You can request a free sample of U products on the kotex website, and I believe you get 2 pantiliners in the box you get. 
TwoXChromosomes X Sometimes pregnancy hormones do not show up in urine. get a requisition for a blood test. that is the most accurate... I had a friend who had to do the same thing
TwoXChromosomes X I have a Mirena IUD and I have not had a period at all since I had it inserted almost 2 years ago. My doctor said it's more common to have a couple periods before it goes away completely, my body just adapted super quick. My periods were always very heavy and I would get horrible cramps. The hormones in Mirena are delivered directly into your Uterus so I have not had any of the side effects of a hormonal bc. I highly recommend the Mirena, it's the best bc I've ever had!  
TwoXChromosomes X Pricking the clitoris is illegal but removal of the clitoris, removal of the clitoral sheath, and sewing the woman up completely is still widely practiced, even in the US there are cases of it. It's not just the make it illegal but to convince mother's not to do this to their daughters.
TwoXChromosomes X :(  I know *exactly* how you feel regarding the hormones...I had issues with hormonal birth control as well, and eventually got the ParaGard IUD. It was awesome. When it was time to re-up they talked me into the Mirena... it was **so** awful for me. I eventually asked to have it removed and went back to the ParaGard, and it took over a year to get back to normal. I'm *so*, *so* sorry that they won't make it easy for you to get what you need. :(
TwoXChromosomes X The "potential" aspect is a qualification of the "human life" position.  I believe the fetus is human life, and I believe human life has value.  However, I'm not comfortable saying "It's never okay to take human life" as a blanket statement - I support euthanasia, for example.  So the next step is, what gives human life value?  To which I answer, it creates conciousness/personhood.  It is the future of that life - whether that future ("potential") is in the next instant or in 9 months or in 10 years - that gives the life its value.  Let me ask you a question:  Say you have, in the hospital, two hermits with no friend/family who are in comas.  The doctors say there is a near 100% chance that hermit #1 will come out of the coma and fully recover, and a 0% chance that hermit #2 ever will.  Do you think it's okay to pull the plug on either of them?  If (as I'm hoping) you say no to hermit #1 and yes to hermit #2, I've illustrated my point about potential.  Both are alive, but neither has consciousness.  The difference is, hermit #1 is going to regain his, while hermit #2 isn't.  The *potential* for personhood makes hermit #1's life valuable.  Make sense?  **tl;dr: Human life has inherent value, but only insofar as it is capable of creating a person.** 
BabyBumps X I started to feel myself show around 16-17 weeks, but it became more obvious to others (like people who had no idea I was pregnant) at around 20-22 weeks. I also had the same thing as you and I thought I was going to start showing early and it was all baby, but it was really just me eating way too much. By the end I had gained 70 pounds. I really wish I would have watched what I ate more because it looks like it's all belly while you're pregnant, but then after the baby your belly flattens out and then I realized how big my arms and thighs had gotten too :/
TwoXChromosomes X I've since decided to make the switch, and I've had the Mirena out (and the ParaGard in) for about two weeks now.  I have yet to tell a difference with my skin, but my dermatologist said it might take up to 6 weeks to tell if having the Mirena out will make my skin calm down.    I *can* tell you that I had significantly less problems with cramping after I had the ParaGard put in than I had after my previous Mirena insertion--maybe this was because I had already had an IUD in place and my uterus was accustomed to it?  I had mild cramping for about 24 hours... and then nothing.  I also haven't had any problems with mid-cycle spotting, though I have had more discharge than usual.  I've yet to have a period, but I'm hoping the duration/heaviness won't be too bad.  Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I *love* having an IUD.  I have the Paraguard, the copper/non-hormonal one.  I took the pill, but had some issues, and it was thought it might have been making sex painful for me.  Then I switched to the Nuva-Ring, and eventually an IUD.  The pill was nice because I knew exactly when to expect my period, and that it was going to be light.  I found it a bit of a nuisance to have an alarm set on my phone to remind me to take it every day.  The Nuva-Ring was obviously even more convenient time-wise, but I lived with the vague paranoia that it was going to fall out.  And then I got my IUD.  It was covered by my insurance so I payed a $20 copay (for a 500+ IUD and the insertion, score!).  Before any birth control, my period was pretty regular and average (not too heavy).  The first few months after I got the IUD, I had some bad cramps and a heavier flow.  That lasted about 3-4 months, but everything settled down.  It's been maybe a year now, or a little less, and I couldn't be happier.  Everything sorted itself out pretty quickly, my period is very regular, almost exactly as it was before the IUD, and the cramps are much more mild.    I love it.  I love not having to take any kind of hormone, I love not having to *remember* to take anything, I love that I'm covered for 10 years and all I have to do is check the strings once a month.  I highly recommend trying it.  The only thing I'd stress is to give it a few months, even if you don't like it.  Remember your body's getting used to a foreign object, and everyone's different.
TwoXChromosomes X I first started birth control with the patch. However, I was too paranoid to use it (kept thinking it was going to fall off). Then, I was on the pill for about a year. It sucked having to remember every morn to take the pill and the time before your period was always hell on earth because you fear you're pregnant.   Then, I actually got pregnant on the pill and I decided enough was enough. I switched to the Mirena IUD (very low, localized hormones, not the copper one) over 3 years ago and it's been fucking awesome.   Positives: not having to remember to take a pill every morning, increased effectiveness, and significantly lighter periods (note: the copper IUD does the opposite and makes periods worse).  It hurt more than anything else in the world when they inserted it, but the pain was short lasting. There's also a 1-2 month adjustment period where you will probably spot/ bleed as well. Everyone reacts differently, but I will never go back to the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X I love my paraguard IUD so much.  It took about a month to adjust to the point of having no cramps, and sometimes my periods are heavier than normal, but other then that it is so great to be hormone free.  Mine was a relief because I had the worst reactions to even the smallest amount of hormones. before I got the IUD I got pregnant at 18 (stupid me) after I had my son I tried the depo shot because I hate to take pills (i gained 20 pounds). So I went no hormones and I love it. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's ok, that's an orgasm. :) Some women sometimes ejaculate, others don't. For some women, different kinds of stimulation mean different kinds of orgasm and g-spot orgasms are more likely to be ejaculatory orgasms. For other women, g-spot orgasms are different but not ejaculatory, and for others, g-spot stimulation might not be a thing that works for them.  (some of this is also covered over on [Silicone Valley]( -are-now-competing-products)!)
TwoXChromosomes X Is it possible to get a different level of hormones in a NuvaRing? I've tried the lowest dose offered in a birth control pill and I still couldn't handle it, my body just does not like HBC. 
TwoXChromosomes X I only had to take Plan B one time. I'm not sure if I was ovulating or not, but I did not get pregnant.  Also I know a dumbass who takes Plan B like regular birth control and she has yet to have a single baby.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Why is a person valuable?  This is a big question, obviously.  But it's not one I am more entitled to answer than you are.  Like the rest of society, we both place value on "conscious persons" - the argument at hand is whether I am right to extend that value to "not yet conscious persons."    I think I'm safe assuming, for this argument, that a person is valuable.  &gt; the death of a fetus kills only potential. The killing of a grown human kills both a consciousness and a potential consciousness.  This is why I'm using as my example the comatose hermits.  Hermit #1 is **not** a consciousness at time of killing.  Or, if you think he is, then so is Hermit #2, and you should oppose killing him as well.  You didn't answer the question, so I'm not sure which you think.  &gt;  Also, Hermit 1 is already a person. he has already existed as a consciousness. A fetus has never been conscious so killing a fetus is not the killing of a person.  Alright, here you've started an argument and not followed through with it.  Hermit #1's past is important to you - a past the fetus doesn't have.  Okay, but why?  And this previous personhood obviously isn't your only criteria, especially if you are okay with killing Hermit #2, so you need to flesh out your argument quite a bit.  (And by "need," I mean "should, if you are interested enough to continue this conversation.")
TwoXChromosomes X Yes of course. I just prefer using smaller tampons and occasionally if I don't get a chance to go to the bathroom I don't want it leaking all over the place. I've been using tampons for 12 years; I think I know what I'm doing.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had the Mirena IUD for 5 years now and I'm LOVING it.  I had cripplingly painful cramps, super heavy flows, etc. since I was 14.   Immediately after getting the IUD my periods gradually became lighter and lighter until about a year in - boom! - no more periods.  I don't miss them at all.
TwoXChromosomes X I think people who rave about the cup tend to have heavier periods. For me, I had to change my tampon every hour.  I also always wore a pad because sometimes my tampon would leak. This meant many bathroom breaks during my menses, and lots of purchasing, using, and disposing of tampons/pads.  My cupboards and purse and trash were full of them. The tampons made me feel dried out and icky inside, and that feeling would last for a few days after my menses was over. Every bathroom trip, I'd see blood that leaked on my pad, or spilled off the pad onto my underwear... and if I was lucky enough not to see that, I'd see it on the toilet paper when I wiped. The pads were lumpy, sometimes the adhesive sticks to your skin or even worse, to your pubic hair.  The plastic ones would cause my skin to sweat while wearing them and I'd break out in a rash, which would feel really uncomfortable.  Enter the cup... now I can go 4 hours between emptying it during the day instead of hourly.  And on my non-heavy days, I can go a full 12 hours - which means I empty it once when I wake up, once before bed, and that's it.  No more leaking, no more blood to deal with all day long - not even when I wipe.  It's almost like not having a period at all.  Seriously life changing.
TwoXChromosomes X Abnormal pap could be the symptoms of HPV, but lack of it doesn't tell you for sure whether it's gone or not.  And HPV isn't permanent, so it's not true that if you had warts in the past you necessarily still have HPV now.  You might.  But then, so might anyone else - most people in the US have HPV at some point, and most of them will never know they had it.
TwoXChromosomes X As far as I know, you don't "test positive" for HPV. An abnormal pap is often assumed to mean HPV, but it can also mean other things (most commonly, simply a badly performed test, or in some cases the start of your period within a few hours), *and* a clear pap doesn't mean you *don't* have HPV. I've never heard of anyone getting a blood test.
TwoXChromosomes X Pro-choice doesn't mean "agreeing with everything you say". It means believing that women should have the legal and medical means to have an abortion if they should choose. Someone can be pro-choice and still think having an abortion or having a baby is a bad decision.  You asked 2XC for advice, and they gave it to you. 
TwoXChromosomes X My friend miscarried due to an (undiagnosed) bicornuate uterus.  She had an operation and now has two healthy daughters.  
TwoXChromosomes X No, sexual assault DOES NOT "range from comments...".     associating the non-crime of unwelcome words with the very real crime of physical assault is offensive and demeaning to all the victims of an actual crime. I'm surprised that 2xc tolerates that kind of belittlement of victims of assault
TwoXChromosomes X Not just that. The copper puts the lining of the uterus in a "chronically inflamed" state, so that if an egg cell gets fertilized, it can't attach itself and grow, and dies or is discarded.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes it absolutely does - the exertion of power over another via comments and/or physical force - both forms of assault.  And also, the OP asked about emotional assault as well - so ya, i was writing to that end.
TwoXChromosomes X But that's not really what the abortion debate is about. It's about whether women get treated as fully human or not. The whole notion that embryos are human is a red herring -- even the most rabid pro-forced-pregnancy activist doesn't think that a woman who gets an abortion should be prosecuted like a person who commits murder in the first degree.
TwoXChromosomes X no.  assault requires physical contact.  battery requires physical injury.
TwoXChromosomes X That's simply false. Like I said, "even the most rabid pro-forced-pregnancy activist doesn't think that a woman who gets an abortion should be prosecuted like a person who commits murder in the first degree". If they truly believed it was a "genocide", they'd be trying to send women to jail.
TwoXChromosomes X Agreed with the previous two posts.  My first time lasted long enough for the hymen to break.  It hurt so bad.  I also bled quite a bit (more than my period I think... I have light periods).  Needless to say, the second time around was way better.  Good to plan for no one to be around though, because if you're like me, you might yelp a little from the pain.
TwoXChromosomes X Any chance you're taking a progestin-only birth control pill (Micronor or Jolivette?). This happens to me on occasion w/ the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X My stepmom has something called a "butterfly uterus" I think. They didn't find out until she was very pregnant and my little brother couldn't rotate to have his head facing down. The uterus is heart shaped so the baby only will fit sideways. After pushing on her to try to get the baby to turn and attempting to induce labor, they had to C-section. My other brother was a C-section, too. Seems like lots of women have abnormal uteri.
TwoXChromosomes X If I'm understanding you correctly, you just had sex last week you wouldn't be getting any symptoms at about 1 week pregnant? So you're probably just freaking yourself out/stress/or BC causing these things. I wouldn't go off BC, just keep taking it regularly. If you've missed a period all together though, and you would be more like 5-6 weeks pregnant at this point then you should take a test asap and find out. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for two years now. I got it because I was terrible at remembering to take the pill every day, and I didn't want to have to worry. It was slightly uncomfortable to have inserted, but I haven't experienced any pain since then. I used to get my period for about 8 or 9 days with heavy cramps and heavy bleeding for about 3 or 4 of those days. I have none of that anymore, no moodiness, and no other negative side effects. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm using one now!  I have the ParaGard IUD and so I have extra heavy periods... I have to empty my [Lunette]( ) cup every 8-10 hours, but I have it in 24/7 during my periods and only use a pantyliner for backup.  It takes practice to insert, but if you get it in properly it forms a light suction -- so no leaks.  Also, unlike tampons, you can use it to catch discharge mid-cycle since they won't cause dryness.
TwoXChromosomes X I have one and I hate it.  It was extremely painful to put in and it took three tries because my cervix was being difficult.  They told me my period would go away in a few months, but it didn't.  In fact, I get spotting for like 2 weeks out of the month.   (I've had it almost two years.) I want to get it taken out soon, i'm just a procrastinator.  Most people have good experiences with it though.  My cramps are definitely lighter and even my heavy days are pretty light compared to before (it would only take minutesto soak a super tampon before.)
TwoXChromosomes X According to the little booklet that comes with each ring, there's actually enough hormone to last 10 days past the 3 weeks, so my doctor told me I could just wear the same ring for 4 weeks rather than 3. Maybe check with your doctor about that?
TwoXChromosomes X yeah. apparently i was just "destroying him"...whatever that means. he would push me against a wall and try to stick his dick up my shorts :-(
TwoXChromosomes X Public restrooms can be a worry when you first start using one and haven't got the hang of it, but after a while you will be comfortable with how often you have to change it (for me that is only morning and last thing at night), so you won't often need to empty it in a public toilet. Also after a while you won't be worried about dropping it.  It wouldn't pop out when you sleep. It is much more comfortable to sleep in than a tampon because it has no string poking out. You don't need to wear underwear.
TwoXChromosomes X First try a different brand of pill.   Your hormones change throughout your life, and what suited you perfectly one year may give horrible side effects the next.  Try at least one more brand, maybe two.  Secondly try a different form of birth control, as others have suggested.  You could even try something like condoms combined with fertility charting and withdrawal - done very carefully that would be nearly as protective as the pill. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just started using the Diva Cup about 3 months ago (that's about 2 periods, for me).  I'm a very small girl but I have very heavy flows that leave me changing even super tampons every 1-2 hours. Talk about expensive! The Diva Cup has been a godsend for me.  Once you learn how to use it, there's very little mess.  For me, tampons were worse and I find pads downright disgusting.  The Diva Cup took a few days to get used to physically, mainly because I don't have time for dating and don't have sex on a regular basis, but when I used it for the second period everything was peachy.  I've been lucky in that it seems to fit my body perfectly.  I've never had a leak, I've never been able to feel it once it's in, and I've never had trouble getting it in or out.  I recommended it to my mum (she also has heavy flows), but I don't think I would recommend it to my little sis (virgin, doesn't even like the idea of tampons).  I'm also very pleased with having reduced my carbon footprint, by however small an amount.  Never buying pads or tampons again eliminates a lot of waste.
TwoXChromosomes X I have had mine for 5 years and am about to get my second one.  I LOVE it!!!  For me it's absolutely perfect.  It didn't hurt that badly to get it put in, but I have had 2 kids so that may account for that.  A little bit of cramping that evening, but I was fine the next day.  I only get occasional spotting, maybe once every 4 months or so, no actual periods.    Personally, the no period thing for me is the best part about it.  I don't have any negative side effects.  I think (and this is just me) that the very low dose of hormones in Mirena is not enough to affect me.    Of course, every woman is different but I wouldn't trade the Mirena for anything
TwoXChromosomes X Do you feel it, then? I know if I haven't put a tampon in far enough because it's profoundly uncomfortable to sit. Is it the same for the diva cup?
TwoXChromosomes X When you first start using one you might. once you get used to putting it in there and everything you don't really feel it at all. It also helps to trim the stem some. I still have a stem on mine, but just a little to help me grab it, some gals take the entire thing off though.. but if the stem is too long it can poke you (reaaaally uncomfortable in my experience) - definitely play around with it before you use it for real/during your period. 
TwoXChromosomes X Be careful of Depo.  I absolutely loved it when I was one it but those side affects they list aren't there to look pretty.  It messed with my bone density pretty bad.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't really think it could slip completely out of your vagina.  If it's not in properly, it can leak.  I used pads as back up while I was still figuring it out.  Haven't had a leak in ages.  It's silicone, so I don't see it breaking either.
TwoXChromosomes X For a lot of women, in addition to their bodies taking time to adjust they also may not start their period the day after the placebo pill.  For some it can take a few days.  Give your body time to adjust, and all should be well.
TwoXChromosomes X It usually takes about 2 to 3 days for my period to start after I start my placebos. It's just your body catching up. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I took my first white pill yesterday and no period yet.  You most likely aren't going to get an immediate withdrawal bleed by the very first placebo pill. You aren't having a period anyway, it's a withdrawal bleed. You might need a day or two or three off the hormones before you bleed. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had pains in the same area for weeks. Not as severe though. I finally went to the doc and he said that is was probably gallstones and that if it got worse come back, and if it got better, good for me. I haven't had them since but I'm always waiting for it to happen again. One of my friends had her gall bladder removed and the preceding pain was EXCRUCIATING! 
TwoXChromosomes X I really don't like taking my lunette cup out or putting it in, especially since the cup has caused my vagina to get tighter, but it does not skeeve me out 100%, but I like it considering the alternative.  I can't imagine anyone who has OCD for example, even considering using a cup. 
BabyBumps X I bled in my first trimester so they took my HCG levels. The only thing she was looking for was if it doubled over the 2 days I took the test. She never showed any concern for the number, only the fact that it was increasing at a certain rate.   I will also comment, as everyone else has, don't read the internet until your second trimester! Even though statistics say you have a better chance of having that baby than miscarrying, the internet will make you feel otherwise. The warning symptoms the sites give you are so vague many of them are just signs of pregnancy! I was convinced I had an ectopic pregnancy. When I went in for my sonogram I asked the doctor if they will know if it is ectopic. He asked surprised: "Why would you think you have an ectopic pregnancy?? That is pretty rare." That is when I realized that the internet had made me go crazy. 
TwoXChromosomes X Without having thoroughly read through the linked topic (so may have missed something) i don't remember seeing anything that came close to sexual harassment being mentioned. Being a sexist ass isn't sexual harassment by any definition i know of o.0  In terms of definition, Google defines sexual harassment as: &gt; Harassment (typically of a woman) in a workplace, or other professional or social situation, involving the making of unwanted sexual advances or obscene remarks.  Wiki defines it as: &gt; Sexual harassment is intimidation, bullying or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Candida albicans is a yeast which causes oral and genital infections in humans. The infection is 'candidiasis', better known as thrush. It is treated with antimycotics (anti-fungal drugs).  In other words you have most likely a yeast infection which is very common and you can get rid of it by going to doctor and asking medication. One drug that has worked on me pretty well is Fluconazole, it's cheap too. Then you might want to take some probiotics too.  Have you been on antibiotics lately? That can cause yeast infections.  But you really need to talk to doctor if you have never had yeast infections, to make sure it is one..
TwoXChromosomes X I'm hoping to give birth as naturally as possible in a hospital (I have some complications so I'd still like to be at a hospital just in case) and it stuns me how many people ask me why I want to have a natural birth.  I'm a big believer that our bodies know what to do and I don't need interference with the process unless something is going seriously seriously wrong.
TwoXChromosomes X I am a lunette cup user and I love it! I have been using it about 7 months now and it has given me no problems with leaking. I have the Green Diana. I have never had a child and my periods are pretty average so I went with size 1.  My ONE issue with the cup is that sometimes it can get a funky smell. I usually just boil it with peroxide and leave it in the sun to dry and make the smell out.   I have saved SOOO much money on tampons and the such. CUPS ARE THE WAY TO GO!  best of luck lady ents... cup it up!
TwoXChromosomes X That "wall" is your PC muscle when it is closed. If relaxation, lube and arousal don't work to open it up as much as you'd like, you can get help for vaginismus.  I saw a urogynaecologist, who specialises in sexual pain, for my diagnosis. Now I'm going through pelvic floor physiotherapy to gain control of the muscle.  Best of luck and feel free to ask me anything.
TwoXChromosomes X I learned that the stuff in cranberry juice that helps with UTIs is called d-mannose. It is a sugar and looks like powdered sugar in its pure form. The type of bacteria that causes UTIs prefers to nom on d-mannose instead of sticking to your body. The human body can only process so much d-mannose at a time, so if you ingest enough of it, it's expelled through your urine.   You can buy pure d-mannose, I found mine online. It tastes sweet. I recommend a teaspoonful after sex to prevent UTIs and if you start feeling that irritation of a UTI coming on, dissolve it in water (as directed on the bottle, usually) and drink as much as you can until your symptoms are gone gone gone.  I discovered all of this at a time when I did not have health insurance. The d-mannose worked like a charm for me without having to be on antibiotics and disrupt the natural balance of good bacteria.  Edit: spelling
TwoXChromosomes X I get frequent UTIs (I have one right now), and usually pound water and cranberry juice until they go away.  I usually try to pee after sex, but I don't always need to (yeah, I need to drink more water).  I get them even when I haven't been having sex, though, too.  I wipe properly and shower regularly, but that doesn't seem to help.  I'm going to get some of this and start drinking more water to try to prevent them.  Thanks for the info!
TwoXChromosomes X A slight dull ache rather than a sharp stab...really more on the "this is annoying" level of pain than the "omg I'm gonna die" level.    For me at least, insertion was no problem at all (an I've never had a baby either) the cramps for about three or five days afterworlds were worse than the actual insertion its self, but even those cramps were only like a heavy period feeling.  
TwoXChromosomes X Ooh, NO. E. Coli lives in the digestive tract (intestines) and can be found  around the anus - sexy time just leads to a lot of moving bacteria around and it can end up in the urethral area. If you have a colony of E. Coli living in your vagina, you have Bacterial Vaginosis. Generally, E. Coli shouldn't thrive there (leading to BV) b/c the vag not a good environment for E. Coli.
TwoXChromosomes X Go!  It'll be no worse than a gyno appointment, certainly.  Blood is a bad, bad sign.  And if it is a UTI, it's so simple - you pee in a cup, they look at it, and they give you antibiotics.  Which, not even kidding, will seriously cut back on the pain within just a couple hours.
TwoXChromosomes X My period came pretty normally, ahead of time, but normally. BUT the period after that was late by like 3-4 weeks!! I freaked out! 
TwoXChromosomes X I took the two-pill variety of Plan B. I didn't really notice anything aside from some cramping. I had two periods in the same month, and the second came completely without warning. After that, my cycle went back to normal.
BabyBumps X RE hip pain, are you getting hip socket pain or is it more located at the center of the pelvis (pubic bone area)? I have had hip issues with all of my pregnancies... it turns out that your "pelvis" is not one bone but 4, and the hormone relaxin loosens up the ligaments so your pelvis can become unstable and shift around, and the bones can sort of grind together. I experienced this to a large degree with my first pregnancy, and with the subsequent ones I knew to 'baby' my pelvis early on at the first twinge of pain. For example, propping my legs on pillows when sleeping, so they weren't pulling my hips this way or that.  The upside is that supposedly a loose pelvis means an easier delivery (surely true in my case) but it can be very, very uncomfortable. And it's one of those things that is a basically untreatable symptom of pregnancy, and it's cured by delivery. With my first pregnancy it was absolute hell (pain to the point of tears just from rolling over in bed, for example, and god forbid I had to get up to pee) but in subsequent ones, it was uncomfortable, but it was not so uncomfortable as to be overwhelming.  Get over the ugliness, or, hell, they make some [less-ugly crocs too these days]( -kaela/10895,default,pd.html?cid=23D&amp;cgid=women-footwear), because your comfort is a priority, truly it is. Especially this early on. 
BabyBumps X From my second trimester on I never worried about drinking a glass of wine or a half glass of beer with dinner and there is NOTHING wrong with that.  The reason you hear "No alcohol - NO tolerance" is because it is simply easier to explain to woman "NONE" as opposed to what moderation is. People are dumb and think "I've only been moderately drinking" when in reality our versions of moderation exceed theirs.  About the stress.. OF COURSE you are stressed out! In all honesty who isn't especially when your first pregnant.. its a stressful time. Don't even worry about it, you will be fine. Please, enjoy a glass of wine and relax guilt free. Your baby and you will both benefit from being able to relax!! 
BabyBumps X Sounds like the same thing. Google "pubis symphysis dysfunction". Other activities you probably find really painful include standing on one leg to put on a shoe or pants, and getting into or out of a car. I noticed for me the pain was also worst in the morning / night, but was tolerable during the day.   For me it helped to sleep with a pillow between my knees, because otherwise the position of my legs would make my hips hurt worse. Also, don't do ANYTHING that puts stress on your pelvis. I kept it at a very bearable level this last pregnancy, except the one day I took my 1.5yr old to Target, and since it was cold out I jogged to the entrance holding him on my hip. BIG MISTAKE. I felt totally fine while I was jogging, but by the time I got halfway through the shopping, I could only walk while leaning on a shopping cart, and it was excruciating to lift each leg to take a step.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks for bringing this up. I'm gonna try this my next period. My periods are so bad they've made me anemic and my cramps are accordingly intense.
TwoXChromosomes X hm, I'm not saying that I don't believe you, but heat works very well for my cramps.  Is there a secondary mechanism that does that?  If I have to get up and do stuff, then playtex stick on pads are the way to go.  If I'm sitting at home, then I use a heating pad, a hot bath, my laptop, or my cat for warmth on my lower abdomen.
TwoXChromosomes X Sickening. If you know the embryo or fetus can't live and will kill the mother, you become a *murderer* if you refuse to help her.
TwoXChromosomes X Totally hijacking this thread, I hope you don't mind!  I just got a paragard at PP two weeks ago, and I wasn't cramping much after the first day, but these past 3 days I have had periodic sharp cramps.. do you think I should worry or I'm alright?  Thanks :D
TwoXChromosomes X Good luck, I hope all works out.  As for the prenatals, ideally she's taking one basic prenatal (a big mix of stuff with high folic acid and iron), a calcium tablet, and an omega-3. Calcium to too big in pill form to be added in the ideal doses to a prenatal and although some have omega-3, it's best in liquid form. Probiotics may help also.
TwoXChromosomes X Hey. My sister had a cone biopsy + minor surgery and from what I understood, it was to remove the abnormal cells - there's no cancer at this stage (far from it) so don't stress about chemo. It wasn't the nicest experience (there was a maxi pad involved) but she got through it. At her follow-up pap exam some six months later she still got an abnormal result, which was upsetting. However her doctor recommended she wait and see if they resolved, and I confirmed with another doctor that these abnormal cells can 'spontaneously' disappear. Six months later she got a normal result :) I know it's only anecdotal but I hope this helps.  edited to fix terminology
TwoXChromosomes X Have you been on a progesterone only form of birth control before? We all react differently to different hormones. Myself, I can't go near any estrogen forms of birth control, but I'm a year into my second implanon now and loving every second of it.   I find it irresponsible of the doctor to fit you with an implant if you've never experienced living in your brain when it's flooded with progesterone. That being said, give it time for your hormones to adjust. Ask your boyfriend for his understanding and give it at least a month. Your brain should adjust and compensate for it, while the implanon will ensure that your uterine lining remains thin enough to avoid pregnancy.  
TwoXChromosomes X It would be an idea to get a second opinion. I went to see a doctor about getting my implant at 17, the first thing she suggested - even before I said 'implant' - was 'intra-uterine device?'  She was a little surprised when I said that I wanted an implant instead.
TwoXChromosomes X The best lube are plain water-based ones that don't contain parabens, propylene glycol or glycerin. Sliquid natural and Yes! match these requirements. Make sure you don't buy a lubricant without seeing ALL the ingredients.
TwoXChromosomes X [READ ME!!]( ~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm)  This says everything I want to say. (The violinist part.)  If doctors hooked me up to a sick person because that was the only way the person could live, am I obligated to remain hooked up to them? No! It would not be murder if that person died because I did not allow them access to my body. Same with a fetus. It does not get a monopoly on my body solely because it needs my body to survive.
TwoXChromosomes X If I may be presumptuous, you would allow self-preservation  and rape/incest cases to have abortions because they don't deserve to have to go through an unwanted pregnancy, correct? Other women, though? Innocent women "deserve" to have an unwanted child for their temporary negligence/bad luck? Think of a reason between a case you would allow abortion and one you wouldn't. Think of the real reasons you would allow one and not the other. At the crux of it, it's punishment. Victims, to rape or fate, shouldn't be punished with an unwanted child. Dirty sluts however? They shouldn't get to avoid punishment, should they.   As much as people try to argue it's "for the child", this is what's at the heart of the 'allow some, don't allow' others argument.
TwoXChromosomes X No preference, although circumcision seems like a barbaric thing for a parent to do to a kid.  But a woman who prefers one or the other (cut vs uncut) because of superficial reasons or because she thinks foreskins are 'unclean' (which they aren't) is far to petty, ignorant and imature to be having sex in the first place
TwoXChromosomes X Go to a doctor, even if it is a UTI, cranberry and Advil is not going to do shit. Get the antibiotics and take all of them. If you're having them as often as you do, you can get your doc to write you a standing prescription, so you can just head to the pharmacy and get it filled whenever you need to.  Signed, someone who tried to wait out a UTI with juice and over-the-counter tests and ended up with a kidney infection.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't understand the hatred of contraceptives. Most prevent 1) egg and sperm from ever meeting, and 2) fertilized eggs from implanting. Not all fertilized eggs implant. I heard (unsure if it's true) that naturally, 50% don't implant or spontaneously abort so early the woman never knows. Am I going to hell for something nature does all the time? I don't think so.
TwoXChromosomes X Everyone who chops up the genitals of infants is doing something barbaric. I am familiar with Jewish reasons for circumcision as I was a Jewish studies minor. Their cultural reasons for harming little boys are not in any way superior to other cultural reasons for harming little girls. If you're going to hack up foreskins for essentially aesthetic purposes, then you can also hack up labia for those same reasons. If you say that cutting up the genitals of children for no medical reason and without their consent is wrong, then it must apply to both genders. Spare me the 'bigotry' bullshit.  Moreover, if you guys read the post she's referring to, I just called the practice barbaric. I didn't call anyone a barbarian. She made that up so she could launch into her accusations of anti-Semitism, which *she invented.* This is a strawman argument.
TwoXChromosomes X There are [four]( ) distinct gradations of female genital mutilation. One of those types, classified under type III, actually is just hacking up the labia. You should be very embarrassed now. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X It isn't (as of a yet) against the law to make someone feel uncomfortable, or we would all be in trouble at some point.    It is against the law to deny a mother the right to breastfeed anywhere she is otherwise permitted to be.   The protest proves that women are tired of having to stress out about when and where they can nurse. They don't want to plan their whole day around who might feel uneasy when their child gets hungry. They are making a the point that nursing in public might make you uncomfortable, but you are just going to have to suck it up because it is the law.   For the record, I do believe in mutual respect. This means a compromise. I do believe she was being respectful by keeping her child in the ergo carrier. If she walked in his store, yanked off her shirt, sat down on the floor and nursed her baby while she flipped through a pile of albums she would still be within her rights, but she would be a jerk.
BabyBumps X Yup. Didn't want to fear monger-- I'm a student of home birth midwifery, and I don't want to interrupt the awesome discussions going on in this r/. However, the general induction chain is (depending on the induction, obviously) AROM, Pitocin to supplement, since the contractions aren't fast/hard enough, Pitocin makes the contractions too strong, so then there's an epidural + continuous fetal monitoring, then the baby seems to be in distress (or actually is) and there's a rush for a crash C-Section or vacuum extraction. It's a slippery slope.   
BabyBumps X The anticipation I do believe is truly starting to drive me crazy. I want to be able to hold the little guy without hugging myself... be able to see what he looks like and hold him close. I know I should be patient but it is hard to do as it gets closer and closer to the date and then passes it.  I have tried a wide range of things as of this point: walking, jogging, sex, nipple stimulation, spicy food, chinese food, pineapple, birth ball, raspberry leave tea and now a sweeping of my membranes so far no active labor just contractions. I was debating about castrol oil a bit ago and then looked into what it does to induce you and decided against it as an option. I am however scheduled for an induction at 4pm on wednesday so we will see if he comes before then or is going to hold it out.
BabyBumps X My doctor didn't even bother trying until i was like 15 weeks because my uterus was tipped back.  She went straight for the internal ultrasound.  We got to see our baby twice before we heard him!  I'm 24 weeks now, and everything is good.  It's hard not to worry, but try not to, every pregnancy is different.  Good luck with your little munchkin!
TwoXChromosomes X The beginning of sentience is probably harder to define than the beginning of life. The question to be asked is, "when is a human life a person worthy of rights? " I think that any living human being anywhere along the development spectrum is worthy of the right to life. I think that using the beginning of life as the beginning of personhood is much more logical than trying to choose an arbitrary and vague milestone, like sentience, to define personhood.
TwoXChromosomes X Transmitting a yeast infection isn't that rare.  Have your bf use some monistat cream or other anti-fungal medication (many OTC creams contain miconzaole nitrate) on his penis for a few days.      As others have suggested, I would get checked for STDs too, since you could have something like Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and not know it.      And of course wash your underwear, but a yeast infection isn't contagious like a cold....     
TwoXChromosomes X I use Always Ultrathin Heavy. I don't like their new ones, Infinity. They're similar but they don't work the same. Before I started birth control I had a slightly heavier flow and sometimes used the overnight. The thing for me is not that I have a heavy flow, but the heavy pad is longer and that's what I need. Really, I could probably use a panti-liner thickness, but they're so dang small. I move a lot, so I need a bigger pad to catch it all. =]
TwoXChromosomes X Non-hormonal methods that you can double up on include condoms, pulling out, sponge or get fitted for a cervical cap. 
TwoXChromosomes X Off topic, but how does one get tested for fibromyalgia when there is no "test" to diagnose it?  (If it matters, I have it. I'm just perplexed because there isn't a test for it. Unless you're talking about ruling out other issues like an autoimmune disease? I also have Lupus, and fibro is common with that as well.)
TwoXChromosomes X A sister is someone you should never give up on.  Take some time, rest...mourn your father, breathe, plan - however never give up on her.  Based on your outline, I can only imagine that she is trapped in some sort of hell and if you choose to "move on" you are only facilitating this to continue.   
TwoXChromosomes X Relax! You can definitely psyche your body out and make it do some crazy stuff. When are you supposed to get your period exactly? Make sure you take your test first thing in the morning. If you're already late though, the test should pick up a positive at this point. You've always used protection, so you're probably not pregnant. To put your mind at ease I would recommend going to planned parenthood or an OB to get all te answers and possibly get on the pill/nuvaring. 
TwoXChromosomes X My mom had several miscarriages, and tried for a really long time before she finally had me through IUI (and then my sister two years later). Don't give up hope! 
TwoXChromosomes X I was terrified for my first appointment too...I put it off right up until I wanted to go on birth control. Remember though that this is actually for your health and safety! The first time I went, I was so freaked that I ended up scaring off the doctor - SHE didn't want to force me. Doctors generally get into their field to help people and are probably just as uncomfortable with you feeling violated as you are! After that I tried another doctor, who was a younger woman and all kinds of awesome - businesslike but not insensitive. If you don't like the doctor you get, it's okay to back out and try someone else.  I read in the comments that you'd rather not know what was going on, but...you might want to know, at least the first time. My doc gives a running commentary, and I find it comforting. There are a few procedures they have to do; it doesn't take long, but could be confusing if you don't know what they're trying to do.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 27, and it's happened a few times in my life that my body just skipped a month. One time, I was in a really stressful end of semester at uni. One other time, I had consumed pretty hard drugs for the first time. It happened a few other times. But yes, stress can do this.  If your pregnancy tests come back negative and you are using them following instructions, don't worry too much about it! It could take up to 7-8 weeks since your last period for you to get them again.
TwoXChromosomes X If one birth control is making you suffer, try a different one. I have *heard* that YAZ Is much, much worse for you than other forms of birth control in the long term, but I am not a doctor.  May I recommend generic lo/ovral if you prefer the pill; nuvaring if you do not; or a copper IUD If you find out hormones aren't right for you. 
TwoXChromosomes X hi, you're on birth control/use condoms right? just wanted to make sure - no-one else here asked. i always knew i didn't want to get pregnant until i was ready, took precautions and was really lucky (i know it happens anyway). had my first 18 months ago (i'm 32) and trying for 2nd, really glad i waited and i'm positive that it was b/c that helped.
TwoXChromosomes X Usually cranberry juice and the orange painkiller pills are for urinary tract infections. I've not heard of them for yeastie beasties. Cool!
TwoXChromosomes X I waited through one cycle. Started taking the pill after my period ended, went unprotected after the following period ended. My physician instructed me to do that, but maybe it depends on the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X have you ever even had a UTI? the minor ones can and are treatable by drinking a shit ton of water, taking AZO, and taking cranberry supplements. i think you saying that IT WILL NEVER WORK RAAHHH might be trumped by all of us UTI-sufferers who have gotten rid of our UTIs by doing pretty much that.
TwoXChromosomes X Oh man, yeah we had a horror slide show too. Not fun, very scary, and also not very informational. I definitely think there is a correlation between comprehensive sex ed and having a fulfilling and responsible sex life.
TwoXChromosomes X We were taught how birth control worked in an extremely general way. There was a lot of emphasis on BUT IT MIGHT FAIL and even more emphasis on IF YOU HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF. I'd say that 25% of my sex ed was how to prevent pregnancy and what STDs were, and 75% of it was how if we had premarital sex we'd hate ourselves and everyone else would hate us too (and then we'd get pregnant and die of AIDS).  We were also taught that condoms did not prevent the spread of HIV because the virus was small enough to get through the natural perforations in the condom. I did not learn this was false until my early 20s because it was not a common topic of conversation.  This was in a public school in Southern California, too.  Everything I know about sex I learned from the internet, Loveline, and Dan Savage. And it's a fucking miracle I came out the other side of the Loveline thing not totally fucked up for life.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks :) I know some people who never do it, mostly because their lifestyle choice never holds the fear of unwanted pregnancy. I unfortunately had been pressured to use hormonal birth control because I was told that was the only way to ensure no unwanted pregnancy. And in some cases it's true but not without paying a substantial toll with my mental and physical wellbeing.
TwoXChromosomes X Then you probably want to consider the copper IUD unless you have extremely regular periods or are considerably less prone to anxiety than I.  It would be absolutely fantastic to be able to leave my body to its own devices but, because it's devices want children and I do not, that's out.
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, cranberry juice is a well-studied treatment for UTI. It doesn't kill the bacteria but rather helps to flush it from the body.  Unsweetened cranberry juice contains a large amount of proanthocyanidins. It ends up concentrating in the bladder and causing bacteria to release from the walls of the bladder/urinary tract, allowing the body to clear the infection faster.
TwoXChromosomes X Try Nuvaring. It has the lowest dosage of hormones because it delivers them directly to where they're needed. I had issues with Seasonique but Nuvaring  has been a godsend. 
TwoXChromosomes X What are the most effective non-hormonal birth control methods?  I wanted to get a diaphragm, but the birth control recommendation website I found did not recommend it because it was not effective enough for someone who was not married or would be otherwise less worried about pregnancy.
TwoXChromosomes X J. Crew has a "factory" store on their website open on the weekends and it's pretty cheap. Their sale stuff on the regular website is cheap too (there is a sale going on now actually). I love J. Crew because the clothes never go out of style. They are well made basics that can last through seasons (and years!) The factory store is only open Fri/Sat/Sun, but it's definitely worth a look.
TwoXChromosomes X If you are not worried about STIs, the ParaGard is the safest form of non-hormonal birth control. It's a copper IUD (Intra Uterine Device) that is inserted into the bottom of the uterus via the cervix. Shaped like a small T, it provides pregnancy protection for more than ten years. It's over 99% effective and has no hormones. 
TwoXChromosomes X when i went off depo the first time it was almost a full year 10-11 months until i got my period again. and then it was constant bleeding for about 3-4 months. which terrified me. from what i learned from the doctors was that with the depo, once you quit, its best to start another form of birth control to start regulating your period again. or else you will probably have the same problem i did. 
TwoXChromosomes X Oof, okay.   So, let's say you're my patient. This is what I recommend.   You read Taking Charge of Your Fertility, chart cervical mucus/temperature. If your cycle is regular enough, start using the fertility awareness method combined with a diaphragm/spermicide, either abstain when you're fertile or use condoms. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think the answer to this varies a lot for each couple; some people (including the other responding posters) have been very successful, while other people get pregnant while using condoms or even while on the pill =/ Rare, but it happens! I can direct you to this [table]( _of_birth_control_methods#Comparison_table) which shows failure rates for each method of birth control. Your method is a hybrid, so it's hard to be specific, but condoms have a typical failure rate of 15%, and the calendar/natural family planning method has a typical failure rate of 25%.  An important note is that it's almost impossible to use birth control "perfectly". People calculate dates incorrectly, ovulation happens at a slightly different time, the condom slips, you put the condom on late, you decide not to use the condom one time, etc. Some people are certainly better at adhering to the rules than others, but "perfect" use is still hard to achieve.
TwoXChromosomes X This may be more of an opinion question, but I'd really appreciate anything you have to say about this.  I've been on hormonal birth control for approximately the last 3 years.  I always taken them exactly at 9pm, have never missed a pill by more than 15 minutes, and if I was on antibiotics or had vomiting/diarrhea, I would make sure to use backup.  When I first started taking bc, for the first month or two, my boyfriend and I used condoms.  We stopped using them after that since we have no STD concerns and I felt confident my bc was working.  I've never had a pregnancy scare, but I still sometimes wonder if I should be using some sort of second method.  It would be absolutely terrible if I got pregnant, so lately I've been wondering if I should use something else.  My question is first, do you think it's a good idea to use a second method even with perfect hbc use?  Have you ever seen anyone get pregnant even with perfect pill use? And finally, what would you recommend as a second method assuming STD protection is unnecessary and I really dislike condoms.  Thank you so much!  
TwoXChromosomes X My husband and I have been trying to conceive for nearly a year without success. Today I went in for an ultrasound and they found a 4cm hemorrhagic cyst on my left ovary and 2 2cm fibroids in my uterus. My gyno says that it's unlikely these are contributing to my fertility problems. True?
TwoXChromosomes X The way the pill works is to stop you from ovulating. What I've read is that the period you have is not a true period, but "breakthrough bleeding" that you get from stopping your pills. It's more of a reassurance for you. If the pill is working effectively, you would not have ovulated that cycle, therefore cannot get pregnant. Stopping the pills doesn't make it so that you ovulate during the off week.
TwoXChromosomes X I really wouldn't recommend the Fertility Awareness methods as far as effectiveness goes. If you look at Planned Parenthood's [Contraceptive Comparison Chart]( -topics/birth-control/birth-control-effectiveness-chart-22710.htm), you'll notice that they are arranged by tiers, most effective at the top, and within those tiers the methods are arranged with most effective on the left, least on the right. Rhythm methods are placed in the bottom right.  They require careful calendaring and when you mess up, it's not always as noticeable which makes it trickier to get Plan B.
TwoXChromosomes X Cancer is caused by multiple genetic defects. One of those defects in cervical cancer can be caused by HPV. ~99% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV, but not all HPV turns into cancer. And this is the reason you need to get a pap test. You can have an HPV infection and nothing come of it, absolutely nothing, or you could show signs of infections ie: abnormal cells and it clear itself up on its own, or it can turn into cancer. As far as cancer being an STD, no, but it can be CAUSED by one. In fact, HPV has been linked to other cancers as well.  Sorry for being such a bitch, but it seemed you need a frying pan across the head to get the point across. It now seems you are genuinely ignorant (I mean that in the "doesn't have knowledge" kind of way, not the 'ignorant asshole slob" way)  You should really read up on cervical cancer and pap tests. The reason cervical cancer is so extremely low in industrialized countries is because of the pap test. It is still the #1 cause of cancer death in women world wide.  The [wikipedia]( _test) article is actually a good place to start and has some nice picks of what the pathologists look for.  And some [general information]( ) about cervical dysplasia. This is what the pap test is looking for, changes in cells that can possibly lead to cervical cancer.  So the reason everyone is having an incredulous reaction toward you is because you are coming off as extremely naive for a simple test that could prevent you from dieing of cancer.  Seriously, get edumacated and go get a pap test. It won't kill you, but not getting one might.
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely get checked out by a doctor, and get referred on to more specialised help if needed.  Intercourse is impossible for me. I saw my family doctor (got swabbed for infections, couldn't do pap), who referred me on to a urogynaecologist (a specialist in sexual pain) (more investigations of other potential causes and a pap under anaesthesia) who referred me on to a pelvic floor physiotherapist for treatment to help me loosen my muscles.  Good doctors will sort you out :) _ow_to_wow_demystifying_painful_intercourse
TwoXChromosomes X I use fake moans to help heighten sensation and lead to real moans too. I think it helps with breathing or something.  It's usually very obvious if I orgasm - lots of muscle spasms that don't need faking.  I ask my husband for a re-match if my orgasm wasn't so much fun or I didn't quite get there that time, and he does the same with me. It's always fun to try again! :D
TwoXChromosomes X Ann Taylor Loft! Cute clothes for woman and they are sexy! They are in the mid to upper price range but I usually only go shopping there during their 40-50% off sale items. I've gotten a $40 shirt for $5 and a $200 coat for $70 before on their final sales. Definitely worth waiting for them to move to the sales racks. 
TwoXChromosomes X Haha I'm in hardly any pain. Just trying to relax really with maybe a contraction once an hour now. My first baby was born through a pretty full on labour but this is going so slow :/
TwoXChromosomes X This is all really good information, but 12% average failure rate is not on par with pulling out. A year of using the pull out method the perfect failure rate is something around 60%.  A diaphragm may not be the best method of prevention but its way better than just pulling out. 
TwoXChromosomes X Due dates are based on LMP, but both ovulation and implantation could have occurred later, making you not as far along as you originally thought.  Hang tight, wait for that next ultrasound.  Oh, and brown blood is old blood, and not usually indicative of a miscarriage.
TwoXChromosomes X I have had all positive results when I take a certain progestin, but when I switched to pills with different combos of hormones (due to changes in health insurance and what-not), I have had some not-so-good side-effects like breast tenderness. However, I switched back to good ol' norethrindrone, and everything is peachy again!  When you find the right hormone balance, the pill can be a wonderful thing! 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm sorry, but where are you getting this incorrect information from? Yes, birth control has made strides in the last 10 years, but the majority of the women I see are struggling with the terrible side effects of the pill. I'm not against birth control in any way, but ask yourself this: did you ask your doctor about long term effects of the pill before you started taking it? I'm guessing no. And even if you had asked, your doctor probably would not have been able to tell you. CDC/FDA/NHI don't give two fucks about women. 
TwoXChromosomes X How are you monitoring your fertility in the mean time? I know I have pretty much been monitoring my ability with doctors since I was 16 and issues first arose.    Is there testing you can do like genetics for checking for chance of having a child with issues prior to the pregnancy?  
TwoXChromosomes X Which implant do you have? I just got implanon and it can cause irregular and/or constant bleeding, but so far I've had none since I had it inserted. Fingers crossed!
BabyBumps X Ultrasounds can be way off on weight estimates. I believe it is plus or minus 2 lbs. Also, inductions often lead to c-sections. For first time mom's I think it is a 50% higher chance of c-section if you are induced. There is something called a Bishop's score that can be useful in predicting if an induction might be successful. I would look into that before deciding to induce. If your body isn't ready, an induction isn't going to work.
TwoXChromosomes X My advice: speak to your doctor about exploring other birth control options. If you're anything like me, your moods may not be able to tolerate hormonal birth control whatsoever. The pill puts me in a permanent PMS state: depressed, irritable, and anxious.  Have you looked into an IUD? If that's not an option, keep switching pills until you find one you feel your mood stabilize on. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was on the pill for 7 years, no side effects except super short, regular, cramp free periods, clear skin, and no pregnancy scares.  I have a Mirena IUD now, which is also treating me great (no side effects except no periods at all - hooray!).  I feel very lucky that I have had none of the problems with birth control/my reproductive organs that many women seem to have.
TwoXChromosomes X Do you actually skip all the periods? I do every three months and I always dread that horrible week when it actually happens.  I had a prescription snafu once and had to start the placebo week a month early and holy crap!!! Did it throw off my system!!  It would be nice to avoid all of that, altogether.
TwoXChromosomes X Go to your new pack as usual, and use backup protection (condoms) for 7 days
TwoXChromosomes X Most doctors will tell you that no, there is not. If you skip the placebo week, some women are able to skip their withdrawal bleeds, although some women will also experience spotting. 
TwoXChromosomes X god this is terrifying. do they not realize the reprucussions of this? where the fuck are thier heads? do they somehow think that limiting birth control will stop people from having sex? news flash: it fucking won't. what it *will* result in is more unwanted pregnancies, which equal more abortions. since abortions are soon to be not an option too, it will result in unwanted children or back-alley abortions which will result in dead women. but hey, that's ok, they were shameless sluts anyway, amiright? god forbid i ever meet anyone with this mindset. they'll be missing the equipment needed to make babies real fucking fast. 
TwoXChromosomes X Echoing the other commenters: I've been told about an hour, otherwise it lessens the pill's efficacy.  And I actually do set an alarm on my phone for weekends or when I won't be up at my normal time.   So yeah, better safe than sorry!
TwoXChromosomes X I used to wear the winged pads to bed and some other crazy combinations, but then switched to tampons right before bed because I was having the same issues....I would never go back to pads, and have never had an issue. Just make sure you don't go past 8 hours. 
TwoXChromosomes X Smiles and compliments, if unwelcome, can easily be construed as sexual harassment - a term most commonly used when referring to the workplace, since it requires an element of authority used to attempt to intimidate or coerce someone into an action.  Your examples would actually be cases of sexual assault.  Unwelcome flirting in a public place would just be a case of annoyance.
TwoXChromosomes X No ultrasound images unfortunately. Those are at the hospital. I knew something was up when the ultrasound tech went from being really chatty to standing there silent and telling me she couldn't say anything until the doctor looked at the images.
TwoXChromosomes X Wow, you actually lost the ovary? I had similarly sized cysts (one on each ovary!) and they sliced the fuckers out but both of my ovaries are just fine. One of them was torn all to shit but they're actually incredibly resilient organs, and as of my last ultrasound it apparently looked good as new. My gyno also assured me that even a little sliver of ovary will try its heart out and work pretty normally.  I'm actually really surprised they did laparoscopy, too. My doctors refused and did a laparotomy cos my cysts were so big, and while they'd done blood tests for cancer markers they couldn't be POSITIVE they weren't cancerous.
TwoXChromosomes X As for side effects, be aware of what they can be, so you can change your method if that one doesn't suit your body.  Most methods are quickly reversible, apart from the [Depo Provera]( -Provera) injection, which can take some time to wear off. If it suits your body though, it is awesome, stopping periods for 55% of users in the first year.
TwoXChromosomes X I tried and tried to get an IUD for years and they wouldn't do it since I'd never had children. I don't think it would be so easy for teens to get them. One reason I was told is because the uterus has to have been stretched out from childbirth to allow to IUD to stay in comfortably. Then again, mine works just fine, so who knows. I'd be for this over birth control. I think over the years we will see some implications of half a lifetime on some of these hormonal pills. 
TwoXChromosomes X yikes-glad you discovered that and had surgery- I had a seven pounder in 2000- the doctor told me it was the size of a 30wk pregnancy. I hope your recovrery goes well- after my surgery my periods have been regular and pain free, and the cysts didnt return- I hope it is the same for you.
TwoXChromosomes X You start the pill the Sunday after the first day of your period.  Call your doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X The smallest guy I've ever been with, I wouldn't say was uncomfortable but it was definitely disappointing. I think overall my partners have been average or slightly larger than average, and the smallest guy I was with wasn't that small... still probably 5 inches, but pretty thin.  To be graphic: The sex wasn't bad, it felt better in tighter positions and he was decent at foreplay. I remember that it was really unsatisfying for me to give him head because it just felt so small in my mouth. I liked to be filled. It doesn't have to be huge to fulfill that requirement.
TwoXChromosomes X I found the proceedure relatively ok but as soon as it was in the cramps started and they were pretty bad. It's not unbearable though with a few Ibuprofen, and taking the rest of the day off of work is probably a good idea so that you can go curl up at home and take things easy.   For me the pain only lasted a few hours but over the next two days my hormones went crazy and I just stayed in bed crying. After that though everything went back to normal and I've had no complaints since.  I continued to have periods, with some occassional extra spotting, for about 4 months and then suddenly they were gone. And it's awesome! No periods now for 3 years :)   Also, don't worry about feeling different or checking it all the time. It's natural to feel nervous at first but eventually you just get use to it and learn to trust it. The only problem I had was that my boyfriend is quite large and the first couple of times we had sex he kept stabbing himself on the strings. The doctor just trimmed them down for me though and he hasn't felt it since.   I would totally recommend the mirena. It's made life a lot easier, and being period-free is brilliant!
TwoXChromosomes X Some people have high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction (aka vaginismus) which prevents them relaxing their vagina even when they are fully turned on and keen for sex.  It's estimated to affect 6% of women.
TwoXChromosomes X Just want to point out that not only is amniocentesis very, very safe, but it is *not* the only diagnostic tool available during a pregnancy. Between 10-12 weeks, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is also an available tool. It is a little more risky than amnio, but is just as effective and obviously done within the first trimester.  The 9 week blood test that this video talks about is a screening test that gives you a probability--it is not diagnostic. Current screening tests are begun at 10-12 weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X Sex and gyno exams aren't meant to hurt. If a gyno exam hurts at any point, you should tell your doctor because it could indicate a sexual health issue. If they don't care, get a new doctor. _ow_to_wow_demystifying_painful_intercourse  I can't relax my pelvic floor muscles very far, so I am going through pelvic floor physiotherapy after being diagnosed with high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction (aka vaginismus). All my muscles are knotted up.
TwoXChromosomes X When do you want your future periods to start?  I would start pill packs on Wednesday evening, and my period would arrive Saturday around noon. I liked it because it meant I'd always be home and be able to deal with it. Or maybe you want every weekend to be period free, so start pill packs on Friday.  Some brands come with little days-of-week stickers so you can change the default "sunday starter" to your own cycle.
TwoXChromosomes X It's a different animal. Instead sits a lot higher in the vaginal canal - enough that you can have sex with it in. Reusable menstrual cups sit a lot lower. I've never used Instead myself, but it seems to me that they would result in a lot more spillage and discomfort trying to get it in and out than my Divacup.  I did find that the Divacup had a very long learning curve for me. I alternated it with tampons and used it on and off for over a year before I started using it all the time. I still keep back-up tampons around just in case.
TwoXChromosomes X May I ask what brand you're using and how breathable you find it?  I got a pack recently after being fed up with discharge...just cuz I hand wash my undies and sometimes have a tough time scrubbing it out if it gets dry.  The generic ones I got are convenient but I feel like I'm suffocating down there.
TwoXChromosomes X Uh no. I haven't had kids, it's not painful at all and it's cheaper than pills in the long run. The IUD is the most popular form of birth control in Europe IIRC.
TwoXChromosomes X I am 18 weeks 1 day now and mine has finally mostly gone away. I still puke some and still feel ick so zofran is still on hand for emergencies but OMG i feel like I was just released from prison.  Stupid Hyperemesis.
TwoXChromosomes X My friend had pre-eclampsia and delivered by emergency c section at 31 weeks. Baby is out of NICU and in transitional care now. She weighs about 4 lbs now at birth she was only 2!   Glad to hear your baby did well. 
TwoXChromosomes X Taking any sort of medication will have side effects but it sounds like not taking it is also having a major side effect. I went from Loestrin to Ortho TriCyclenLo and, even though it's a higher dosage of hormones, it doesn't seem to effect my mood like the Loestrin did. So that one medicine wasn't right for you, it doesn't mean that none are right for you. It's like finding the right pair of jeans, not all are going to work for you but it's just about trial and error to find the right fit for you. 
TwoXChromosomes X Planned parenthood is a multi-faceted resource for all things sexual-health and parenting related. They are also a valuable tool in regards to community education.  Planned parenthood offers sex-positive, medically-sound information and treatment in a safe, unbiased environment. They make every effort to support the often-overlooked low-income portions of communities, and typically offer sliding-scale services in addition to (in many locations) free barrier birth control. My local planned parenthood occasionally offers plan-B for free due to grants.  Basically, planned parenthood is the shit.   
TwoXChromosomes X I have been down the birth control gauntlet. Here is my suggestion: [Implanon]( -topics/birth-control/birth-control-implant-implanon-4243.htm).  I was about your age when they tried to insert an IUD and I nearly passed out from the pain. I made them stop and couldn't handle it and I would like to think I'm not a wuss.   Implanon works brilliantly, low chemical, insertion and removal minimal. The IUD scares me with all the possibilities of uterus perforation, rejection, infection. My two cents, good luck! 
BabyBumps X Personally I had an OB but that's because I really loved my OBGYN. As well as I couldn't find a midwife by me that works with hospitals, and I knew 100% I wanted to give birth in a hospital in case some last minute chaos happened. It's really a personal choice. I wanted the person who took care of me could help me in any scenario. If there was an emergency they would be the ones there to help me. I didn't want to have a midwife be swapped for an OBGYN mid pregnancy or mid labor. I ended up having a c-section, so I'm happy with my decision in the end. It was great that the doctor who was with me through my pregnancy also preformed my c-section.   Even though next time I think I'll throw a doula in the mix :p
TwoXChromosomes X I went through a period like this for about 6 months and then it subsided.  My urologist also just kind of shrugged and said that it happens with some people.  I know you mentioned sulfa - but have you tried daily or post-intercourse regimens of other low-dose antibiotics?  It might be worth looking into.   Other things that have helped:  Cranberry supplements daily, avoiding things that irritate the urinary tract (caffeine, alcohol, soda), peeing before and after sex, lots of water.  
TwoXChromosomes X I have never heard of such a thing.  I find it hard to believe that your ins only covers 1 pap smear every 2 years and I would definitively look into that....i'm sorry, i just don't believe this.  If you are sexually active you should get a pap every year period.  There is no way my doctor would ever tell me to go every other year without a pap..no way.  ESPECIALLY being sexually active.  2 years is way to long to go without a pap.  
BabyBumps X I am 14 weeks pregnant and had long thought this through before getting pregnant. I had four options; the first is the "standard" American route, which is to go to the Ob, the next is the midwife who does the delivery in a hospital setting, the third was the birth center, run by midwifes, where you go for your prenatal care as well as your delivery, and the fourth is the homebirth with midwife.   I met with an Ob, a few midwives, and I called the birthing center to get the feel of it all. I did tons of research and in the end, I just went with what I was comfortable with, which was the midwife who delivered at the hospital. This is my first birth and am not comfortable with having a homebirth, but I didn't like the clinical, wham-bam feel I got with the Ob, who barely spoke to me, and just threw a few pamphlets my way, while the midwives spend an hour talking to you and getting to know you.  You have to understand that some midwives won't accept you if they view your pregnancy to be "high risk" and will refer you to an Ob. I wanted a natural birth, and I wanted very little medical intervention. From what I've heard and seen you get to make your decisions with a midwife while you are told what to do by an Ob. Whichever you want to do, it's your decision and you have to decide what's most comfortable for you and your baby. Obviously I'm biased towards the midwife but hopefully your research will lead you to the best choice. 
TwoXChromosomes X The protocols for Pap smear have been changed recently. They now recommend that you don't start until you are 21 (not 18 anymore) and that you get a smear done once every 2-3 years, regardless of your sexual activity. As you get older, you can go close to 5 years between tests.
TwoXChromosomes X It **is** upsetting. I didn't have any anxiety when inserting my first tampon, but it just wouldn't work.  I was fully relaxed, lubricated and aroused when attempting intercourse on my wedding night, but extreme pain (8/10 on the pain scale) still happened and made it impossible.  When I found a really nice doctor that I trusted with this issue, I thought she would be able to get the speculum in. She had tons of lube on it, told me we could stop any time, protected my modesty and told me what she was doing as she went. It felt like burning when she was just holding my inner labia open, but it wasn't too bad. I was breathing deeply from my diaphragm and felt relaxed. But then the speculum "hit the wall" of my PC muscle and it was that 8/10 pain again, feeling like knives stabbing me from inside my vagina (hence my username). We stopped, and my lovely doctor referred me on for further diagnosis and for treatment.  Feel free to ask me anything and read my submissions (but don't get put off by them!).
BabyBumps X I felt nauseas most of my 1st trimester and the first part of my 2nd. Like weeks 8-16. I only threw up once. On one day in the beginning of my pregnancy, I was so ill I just sat on the couch nibbling toast all day. But I have a friend who is also 30 weeks like me, and she is STILL throwing up 5 times per week, so I can't complain!
BabyBumps X I never had bad morning sickness.  I felt kind of queasy around the 8 week mark but never got worse than that.  The hardest part for me was I had not appetite whatsoever and struggled to make myself eat anyway.  On the other hand I had a friend who was sick every single day through the entire thing.  It really varies lady to lady.
BabyBumps X Congrats! When are you due?  My kiddo is sleeping next to me right now (11 weeks old!)  My morning sickness started before I realized I was pregnant - around 3 weeks.  Initially I was really woozy.  I was in the grocery store and lost my balance and almost ran into a man there.  I was super confused about the whole thing but just passed it off as being tired.  I just looked back on my journal entries.  My morning sickness really kicked in at week 5.  Sadly, I had hyperemesis throughout my pregnancy (super bad morning sickness) that lasted throughout the entire pregnancy.  I was puking constantly.  It was terrible.  I also realized almost instantly (again before I knew I was pregnant) that I was peeing like crazy.  That never went away, haha.
BabyBumps X They do think that there may be some genetic tie but in my case my mom felt great never got sick and then I've had hyperemesis. At first my mom and my MIL didn't get how bad I was doing and all I heard was how great they felt while pregnant. I finally snapped about 9 weeks and told them both that I didn't want to hear anymore of those happy stories because I was not having it easy.   They really got the picture around 11/12 weeks when it hit the worst. 
BabyBumps X My morning sickness started at 6 weeks and lasted until 12 weeks. For the first four weeks of that time I was constantly nauseated and was puking up to 6 times per day. I am now 13 weeks and am starting to feel so much better.  Congrats on your pregnancy and congrats on enjoying your new found boobs, I think mine have tripled in size. lol. 
BabyBumps X It's an ultrasound very similar to the one you had at 13 weeks if you did the NT. They look at the brain, the arms, the legs, kidneys, heart (chambers and valves), bladder,spine,ribs, face your placenta and take some measurements and then Ta-Da! That big gender reveal.   I am 18wks3days- just had my anatomy scan yesterday and we found out we are having a Girl. Very exciting stuff. :) She gave us a thumbs up with one hand and a pistol with the other.   Enjoy it!   ps. i'm reading here that some people had to have a full bladder for this- my office did NOT do this. I hope yours does not. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had a strain of HPV that disappeared. I tested for one - can't remember which - at age 19, and never had it show up on any test again. Didn't affect me in any way whatsoever, except that my BF at the time freaked out (we had been dating for a year already when it showed up during a routine PAP.) But it was gone a year later, so I never brought it up with anyone else, and like I said, no test has ever been irregular again. Most likely you'll be fine!
BabyBumps X For me, it started at 4 or 5 weeks, but it wasn't bad yet. From 6-8 it was horrible. Eased up for a week. 9-11 it was pretty bad again. By week 13 it was pretty much gone.
TwoXChromosomes X TIL Gardasil protects wart strains 6 and 11. Not just cancer.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, I think there's two sides to that. Absolutely, feeding a baby with the food our body naturally produces should, definitely, be allowed in public. But, you don't have to flop your boob out for the world to see. Even if you're comfortable with it, many people aren't comfortable seeing it. There are so many garments made to shield your chest while breast feeding that there's really no reason to not have one. Tank tops that release at the straps so you can keep your belly covered; capes that cover your chest and the baby for privacy; hell, just throw a blanket over it and call it done. Many public places, like malls, have special breast feeding rooms in the bathroom. There's ways to do it privately and discreetly. I think the problem comes with women who do it as indiscreetly as possible, and then bitch and moan when people ask them to cover up.  I don't think anyone is against breastfeeding, I think that people are against seeing a boob in public. If I saw one in public, I wouldn't make a scene, but I would walk away or leave the area. However, if I had sons in the 12+ age range, I probably wouldn't be too happy with them seeing it. I mean, *I* know it's not sexual, but not everyone does.
TwoXChromosomes X Take vitamin C with your iron supplement; it increases absorption by reducing ferric to ferrous iron, which the body absorbs more readily.   My doc also told me to avoid calcium in order to increase iron absorption, which seems to be helpful as well.  Sources: [[1]( )] [[2]( )] [[3]( )]
TwoXChromosomes X I had an abnormal pap smear about a year ago. Turns out it was a nasty kind according to my doc. Did a six month follow up, and it was fine! Just did my annual (six months later) and still fine!   Don't stress about it. You're young and (I assume) otherwise healthy. I'm not saying to forget about it... honestly my doc has been doing pap smears since I became sexually active and I think that's about the norm? But remember that what you have RARELY causes cancer... and most of the time just goes away.   *hugs* 
TwoXChromosomes X While I have other issues with a child breast feeding until they can talk, if you cover it right then it's not an issue. Obviously don't find the heaviest blanket you can so you smother your child. But there are things made that cover the whole lap and give ample room to breathe as well as room for mommy to see baby.  The fact is that the American public is not used to and does not like to see boobs in public. It's not going to change because you want to breastfeed. I know plenty of women who breastfeed openly in public and then bitch when people look at them. Listen, you're doing something against societal standards. People are going to look. It's the same as if you were wearing a neon pink and green bikini in the mall. It's different, so people will look at you.   Yes, breast feeding is natural. You know what else is natural? Going to the bathroom. But you don't see guys whipping it out and peeing everywhere (usually), do you?
TwoXChromosomes X I had severe bruising for a fortnight as well as nasua, cramping and headaches during that period. I started bleeding a month in and didn't stop until a year later - which is now, and I'm still wary of it returning. I am also a lot more emotional and quicker to anger. So no, the "horror stories" are far from lies, and you were irresponsible to advise OP that they are.  That said, I am managing it, and still have mine. As I am not consistently sexually active/with my partner (in a LDR), I am giving it a longer trial time and adjustment period. I'm not pregnant, and still in a relationship, so it's working okay. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is good to know! Worsening (heavier) bleeding is a common concern about choosing Implanon. How soon after insertion did you begin to have a lighter flow? Did you try any other hormonal birth control before getting Implanon?
TwoXChromosomes X I got my Implanon inserted  4 months ago. After a consultation with PP, I decided to go that route, even though I have not been on horomonal birth control before. I brought my boyfriend  on the day of insertion; he held my hand and kept on reminding me not to look.  It's pricey compared to other options. But I was not ready for an IUD, and I have a bad history of forgetting to take prescription pills -- I didn't want the worry associated with forgetting to take BC pills.  Within a month after insertion, I had two very irregular periods after insertion. But after those abated, I have had *no period*. Breast tenderness, which used to  happen several days before a period, has also subsided.
TwoXChromosomes X Try more red meat and add your favorite form of vitamin C to your meal when you eat things meant to be iron rich.  Vitamin C reduces the iron into a form which you can absorb through diet.   They must be eaten simultaneously, though.  Edit:  Spinach contains a lot of oxalic acid which inhibits iron absorption.
TwoXChromosomes X I had it. My arm hurt like hell for a week or more. i couldn't even hold it up. Then the hormones made me bleed constantly for months. I eventually had it removed. I wouldn't recommend it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yea it sounds like a hormonal imbalance of some kind. The irregular bleeding, hair growth, and acne lead me to agree with SourPatchGirl in believing that it may be [PCOS]( -ovary-syndrome/DS00423). Have you also had any noticeable/unexplained weight gain?  Having said that, I'm not a gyno, I recommend booking an appointment ASAP.
TwoXChromosomes X I let a UTI infection go on too long untreated and it spread to my kidneys in a very, very painful and near-death experience. Get it looked at PRONTO!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on Depo and I love it. I gained weight, but not an outrageous amount. I haven't had a period in the two years I've been on it, no spotting, no nothing. No side effects at all, except for the weight gain.
TwoXChromosomes X Is it only oral contraceptives that increase the stroke risk? If so that means I could use the patch?! Whatthe.....
TwoXChromosomes X I got the hormonal IUD last December. It was uncomfortable going in (as you said, not painful, just... weird), but it's been totally fine since then. I had some spotting instead of a period for about three months, and then haven't had a period since then. FREAKING AWESOME. Sex all month long! I have occasional emotional meltdowns, which make me think I would have had my period the next day, but they are much better than with the period. Plus no horrible cramping. I am so, so happy I got it!
TwoXChromosomes X Doctors don't generally like putting IUDs in women who have never had a child -- there tend to be more complications, because the uterus hasn't been stretched out (I think).  You might also consider the birth control shot, which works for 3 months, I believe (though I don't know much about it).
TwoXChromosomes X Can't you get an OTC one pill treatment over in your parts? I live in Canada and the last time I had a yeast infection I just headed over to the grocery store, bought the little box with one pill and a little tube of the anti-fungal cream and it took care of it right away. I barely even opened the tube of cream. Good on PP though!
TwoXChromosomes X I buy the variety packs that have everything from light to super. Very, very beginning I use light, then quickly switch to super for most of the first couple days, then back to regular until it's over. But my periods have had time to even out (also thanks to birth control). When I was a teen, I often found myself sleeping with the heaviest flow tampon you could buy, the heaviest flow pad, *and* a towel beneath me.  In essence, don't be afraid to switch sizes based on needs. If you overdo it, it's better than underdoing it, at least in my experience. :)
TwoXChromosomes X chronic yeast infections tend to have an underlying cause. sometimes it's a simple case of bad habits - e.g. wearing thongs regularly can up your chances of getting yeast infections - but other times it could be a symptom of something larger. have you talked to your doctor? 
TwoXChromosomes X it protects againt the 4 leading cancer causing strains of hpv. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not saying that you should suggest *anything*. I'm saying that you should listen to what she wants and support that decision. Trying to change her mind because you think she's ready for a child isn't supporting her decision, it's trying to change her mind.   Your aunt has clearly stated to you that she doesn't want a child right now. She doesn't feel ready. She's more interested in partying. Instead of listening to her, you've been trying to convince her that she is ready, and that she should keep the child.  You are trying to get her to change her choice instead of supporting the choice she makes.   I'm sure this is a very difficult topic for you to think about, but honestly, I'm sure your aunt is having it much worse. It's her that's pregnant, after all.     
TwoXChromosomes X They're made from natural fibers and are biodegradable so it shouldn't be an issue for a septic tank, especially if you treat it with bacteria/enzymes regularly and that's something you should be doing regularly to prevent the build up of oils/grease/food particles in your drains which will eventually lead to a clog.  Buying a $5-10 bottle of bacteria/enzymes once a year beats a $300 plumber bill, especially when they pull your used tampon out of the drain because it got stuck on a partially clogged drain :P 
TwoXChromosomes X If the plumbing in the building is really old, the pipes just can't handle it.  Some of the restrooms around here ask people not to all flush at once or the pipes will leak.
Parenting X And how long did your child drink breastmilk? I'm going to guess not long because the pump didn't pull out much and your pediatrician told you to "supplement" right? How long did the pediatrician breastfeed her children?   It's not about bonding. Having a baby is stressful, *deal with it.* Breastfeeding *from the boob* is the best thing you can do for your baby, don't give up because of a little stress, and don't listen to people that tell you you can't or your baby can't. 
TwoXChromosomes X I personally have no trouble orgasming with my husband. But we've had a long time to learn how to pleasure each other.  Steps to success:  1. Orgasm with him in the room while you masturbate.  2. Orgasm while he holds you while you masturbate.  3. Teach him your favourite masturbation technique and get to orgasm.  4. Let him explore other ways of getting you to orgasm with his mouth, hands and sex toys.  5. Have your clitoris stimulated during penetration (which may just be finger penetration if your masturbation doesn't incorporate it) until you can orgasm with something inside you. Work your way up to his penis inside you.  Good luck and enjoy!
TwoXChromosomes X You should be able to feel the tampon- it shouldn't be hanging out or all the way at the top of your cervix so it shouldn't hurt either.   Over time you will feel them a bit less because you get used to them but yes you still feel it in there.   
BabyBumps X Both my husband and I worked 2 jobs while I was pregnant (I quit at 6 months because the 70 hour weeks were getting a little tiring) but we were able to save quite a bit of money. Through my main employer, I got 4 weeks at 60% with STD and used 2 weeks of vacation and then took four more weeks unpaid and lived off what we had accumulated in savings. Went back to work after ten weeks and by that time I was more than ready to go back.   This time will be a little easier although we no longer have savings, I have up to 8 weeks of vacation that I've saved up and the STD through my company has gone up from 4 weeks to 6 weeks paid. I still plan to come back around 10 or 12 weeks though.  It is so complicated when maternity leave isn't provided for. I'd recommend doing as much freelance work as you can right now while you are pregnant as well in order to get some extra money in the bank. You are not going to feel like working after the baby gets here, I guarantee it. There is enough to adjust to. Some people have to go back to work immediately, but if you don't, then don't.  Edit: Oh yeah, we also wrote down all our expenses for several months before baby got here. Everything - every candy bar at the gas station, every Walmart, everything. We knew exactly how much we were bringing in and how much we were spending, and were able to figure out where to cut and how much we would need to have for those weeks that I would not be getting paid. And one more thing!! If you are on STD they don't take out benefits, and when you're on FMLA even unpaid you're not paying into your insurance premiums, so if your employer pays your insurance premiums while you're out on maternity leave, you may be on the hook to PAY THEM BACK - I ended up having my paycheck reduced for several pay periods until I could pay back somewhere around the amount of $800 for the premiums they had paid for me while I was out. You'll need to adjust for that as well.
TwoXChromosomes X Just a couple additional details (that may not at all be relevant):  * I've been taking the pill for 2.5-3 years, the majority of which was on the same brand (CyEstra-35)  * I've never skipped a period before, and am planning on taking my BC as usual next month  * I take my pill very regularly, practically down to the second each day (thanks cellphone alarm!)
TwoXChromosomes X Go ahead and don't worry about it! I've done this several times for different reasons, such as when my period synced up to a beach vacation or, like you, I wanted to reset my cycle so I didn't get my period over the weekend. You might have some spotting, but it shouldn't be anything to worry about. My pill of choice is LoLoestrin FE, which is a 28-day pill, so I only have 4 days of reminder pills. My period usually lasts a day or two. When I've skipped a period, sometimes the next one will last a bit longer.   As for PMS and general emotional instability, yes the reason you're feeling that way is because you're at the end of your pack. You should feel better once you start your regular pills at the end of the week. Don't worry so much about it! 
TwoXChromosomes X I skipped periods all the time.  Just be really scheduled about it, as it sounds like you are.  There are 4 period/ year pills out there for a reason, it causes no harm, no you don't get crazy build up.  Go for it.
TwoXChromosomes X And indeed, look at history: in the pre *Roe v. Wade* days, women that saw a back-alley practitioner were usually treated not as parties to the crime but victims.  This isn't invariably so to be sure, but it was usually the *performing* of an abortion that was illegal, not the seeking of one.
TwoXChromosomes X I have tried the super light flow kind of regular tampons and they fit okay but they tend to need changing hourly, and a backup liner. I have tried OB years ago, but found that even with my short vag, my fingers are still too short to position the tampon :/  Gonna have to ask my boyfriend to do it for me XD
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;There is something out there restricting medical schools from teaching it  Any resident in ob/gyn will perform literally hundreds of D&amp;C or D&amp;E by the time they finish their training. This is effectively the surgical approach to performing an abortion in the first or second trimester respectively. If it's really early in the pregnancy, simple medication (Methotrexate, etc) can be administered- the same medication that is used in cases of ectopic pregnancy.   just out of curiosity, where did you hear that people can't learn these things in medical school, and what exactly do you think an "abortion" consists of? 
TwoXChromosomes X "I believe a woman should have the right to her own body so it is ok to have a simple procedure done to remove some growing cells but your father thinks doing so is killing a healthy human life"?   I am unsure. I think this issue comes down to a fundamental distinction about what a life is, whether there is a soul, etc and that's a pretty big thing to disagree with a partner on.
TwoXChromosomes X Besides smell, you'd probably have a bit of blood leaking out after a while anyways, assuming you're not at the end of your period. Just always make sure that the string hangs down when you put it in - and then whenever you go to the bathroom you will notice it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, the package says(for me) that there is a 12hour time window for cerazette since it's somehow special and 3 hour window for every other mini pill. When I didn't have an alarm, I remembered to take it usually but once 8 hours later than normally. Since I got Minipill, I set an alarm so I won't forget.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm just asking you how you equate a ball of cells to a learning disabled person. You said they both can't care for themselves. I'm saying you can't care for an embryo, no matter how much care you give, it dies. It doesn't have the ability to live on its own, it's literally a part of the mother. Just like if you cut off your own finger, it would die in short order without your body to sustain it. But nobody goes around claiming murder for killing finger tissue.   You can't come up with any other argument to defend yourself, so you're going on the offensive and trying to say I'm not listening to you and I'm the one that's wrong. I am listening, you just have nothing valid to say. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had H1N1 and while I didn't have seizures or anything, it's still two weeks of misery, coughing, and horrible headaches that I'll never get back.
TwoXChromosomes X Of course you aren't the only one. The side effects for birth control are listed as *possibilities,* not as something everyone will experience. Just like all women don't experience losses in libido, all women don't experience weight gains or acne breakouts.   It also depends on what type of pill you are taking. Some pills have more impact on libido, while other types boast little impact. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah I found that very hard to believe to. It takes *weeks* of nipple stimulation for adoptive mothers to start lactating and even then it might not happen. And usually they take hormones too.
TwoXChromosomes X The same thing happened to me (though I was put off after only one try).  It turns out that I have a problem where I can't relax my vaginal muscles very far, so the tampon or anything else I tried to insert was hitting my PC muscle. 8/10 pain when I tried a penis over a decade later.  I went to my general practitioner (family doctor) who partially examined me (speculum couldn't fit) and referred me on to a urogynaecologist (urogynecologist in US English) who specialises in sexual pain. She did further investigations, diagnosed me, and referred me on to a pelvic floor physiotherapist for treatment.  Treatment of sexual pain is very successful, so there is no need to put up with it.  Although this is about intercourse, it is appropriate advice for any kind of penetration: _ow_to_wow_demystifying_painful_intercourse  Feel free to ask me anything.
TwoXChromosomes X I dated a guy with an extremely small penis - maybe 3 inches - he was thin as well.  most of the time i did not know he was inside me. However, a penis inside me really doesn't do anything for me so...as long as you can get me off...as long as you care enough to get me off...size really doesn't matter..to me anyhow.  oh, and 5 is not small...  
TwoXChromosomes X The wire is soft.  So long as it's not super short, the wire will spend most of it's time back near your cervix - mine kind of spirals around it.  When you're on your cycle, sometimes they'll straighten out, but they remain soft.  He's unlikely to feel it unless he puts fingers up there.
TwoXChromosomes X Try to go for the slender regular ones, the don't hold as much, but they're easier to get in (for me at least) and if you find it's uncomfortable they can be removed with little to no discomfort. If you try and remove a regular or super tampon it'll feel like someone's turning your vajayjay inside out. I'm sure it's been said but if a tampon is in correctly you won't even know it's there.
TwoXChromosomes X Keep in mind, though, the 15% failure rate includes people who didn't even put the damn condom on. They intended to use it, but didn't, so it counts as a non-compliance failure. Perfect use failure rate is only 2%, and it's easy to achieve -- put the damn thing on every time. And failure is easy to see; visible breaks or slip-offs, so its easy to know to take Plan B if you need to. If you are still nervous, combine condoms with fertility awareness, tracking your ovulation via body temp and cervical mucus. Use spermicide or abstain when you are ovulating. Essentially impossible for an accidental pregnancy to occur then. 
TwoXChromosomes X Consider yourself lucky.  I get bad anxiety and general irritability/mood swings like a week before my period.  Then my cramps are so painful I usually can't do much for the first few days but lay in bed sobbing it hurts that bad. 
TwoXChromosome X -and-heavy-periods/novasure-faqs.cfm  its called Endometrial ablation, and basically they put this wire mesh inside your womb and eletrify it, removing your uterine lining and causing it to stop from growing back. Most women stop having a period forever. And while it's *possible* to get pregnant (and if it happens its extremely dangerous) its very very very very very unlikely.  My sis had it done like 3 years ago and hasn't had any menstrual periods since.
BabyBumps X Went in for an induction at 7:00 am on Monday. Apparently I was already contracting every 3-4 minutes apart without even noticing it so I would have gone into full blown labor later that day anyway. Started pitocin around 8 am to really get things moving and still didn't really notice contractions until around 12. My doctor came and broke my water probably around 9:30 and I was 3 cm and 75% effaced. I was super disappointed, thinking I would have liked to be more than only 3 cm but everyone kept assuring me first babies are slow to come out. My contractions started to get painful around 12  and 2 to sometimes 3 minutes apart so I wimped out and got some Stadol which made me and baby sleepy and we needed some oxygen because baby started to have dips during contractions but everything leveled out as it wore off.   Started an epidural around 3 pm so I could relax and stay focused on not tensing up. Got checked by the nurse around 6 pm and was still only 5-6 cm and by then my body was getting used to the epidural and was wearing off. Going from feeling nothing to a lot of pain sucked but luckily I could really only feel the top of my uterus contracting and the rest was still numb. The anesthesiologist was in surgery so I had to wait for him to get out to come fix my epidural, but my nurse said it would probably be awhile. This ended up working out great for me because probably only 15 minutes I started to feel pressure in my back and butt but just figured that I had to fart or poop ( I was really paranoid about pooping during pushing ) so I didn't think to say anything to anyone.  My OB came to check me around 6:45 pm and to my and everyone elses surprise I was complete. She turned off my epidural completely so I could feel my legs around and at 7 we started pushing.   Immediately she told me husband to look because you could see baby's head and we knew this shit was going down faster than expected. No hours long pushing session or practice pushes for me. Maybe 10 contractions and an episiotomy later (though she held off on cutting me til I said it was okay due to my Husband standing up for me and saying not til she says okay) Holden was born at 7:14 pm. Just a little over 12 hours total.   I love him to death. I'm watching him and Dad curled up together on the couch sleeping right now. 
TwoXChromosomes X Since you are new to tampons, might I suggest the Diva cup Menstrual cup.  I switched to using it instead of tampons about two years ago and it was the best decision I ever made! It will save you a ton of money, and its better for the environment. Its medical grade silicone and if you put it in right you don't feel it at all. If you have dryness issues it is especially fantastic.  You should look into it! 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;texas, a conservative &amp; republican stronghold, leads the country in executions so there's a little proof of how they can't wait to flip the switch in the electric chair.  I don't understand the point you're making here.  You're OK with killing babies, but not murderers.  So you're a hypocrite?  I knew that already.    &gt;i don't think the clump of cells in the womb is a life until well into the gestation period.  Neither do I.    &gt;at the beginning it's a clump of cells and a "potential life".  I can same the same for you, now, today.    &gt;60% of all pregnancies are naturally aborted by the body for a myriad of reasons. so that means only 4 in 10 or 40% of all pregnancies actually become a life.  I don't think abortion means what you think it means.  You're describing a 'miscarriage' which is a different process altogether.    100% of human lives are aborted by old age, disease, time.  That doesn't mean we should legalize homicide in cases where the assailant finds the victim to be an onerous burden.    &gt;the human reproductive system is far from perfect or fail-safe. that's why we have such raging hormones (newt, vitter, craig, ah-nold, ensign, etc.) and we f*ck so much. to make up for the short-comings of a highly inefficient system.  I agree, which is why we should treat each successful life event as highly special, and not something that can be thrown away as an inconvenience.    &gt;so i'm pro-choice. and the beauty of pro-choice is that if you don't believe in abortion YOU CAN CHOOSE TO NOT HAVE ONE.  The "you" we are referring to is the baby in the woman's womb.  Supporting abortion explicitly means denying that baby the right to choose to live.    &gt;so i'm more concerned about protecting the lives of those who are in the here &amp; now than a potential life that only has 40% of making it. if we took better care of those who are currently "a life" then the need for abortions would probably decrease a lot.  I'm only concerned with 'protecting' those that need it.  A full-grown adult does not need protection.  An unborn baby is pretty much the definition of 'unable to protect ones' self' (in fact, that's frequently an argument used for why abortion should be legal).   
TwoXChromosomes X I have no clue about the meds, ask your doctor.  But avoid unprotected sex until it clears up, as you are correct, perhaps ask your doctor what your husband should do to ensure he doesn't pass it back to you.  Also, eat yogurt with active cultures and take a probiotic to put back some bacteria into your system.  Feel better! 
TwoXChromosomes X The 60% is everything that goes wrong with a pregnancy, not just miscarriages.   Aborting a clump of cells us not murder because it's not a successful life or a baby until later in the gestational period. 
Parenting X Not I. The ex wanted a boy, I wanted a girl, and we're both happy with the girl we have and neither of us are planning on more children! 
TwoXChromosomes X You know both times I was pregnant my VERY first sign was a sore throat.  I felt like I was getting a bad cold...turns out I was just pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;if you've gone far enough into your pregnancy that the child could potentially live by itself outside the womb, I have a hard time swallowing that it is no longer a separate person.  in order for it to be a separate person, the woman has to be cut open - is this a small matter to you?
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;why does the woman deserve more rights than the fetus at that point?  natural, self-evident rights (well, to me at least). she is autonomous, the fetus is not. they are not both people (yet).
TwoXChromosomes X I have always been fairly skinny (especially when I first started getting periods), and before I started birth control, my cycles were 30 something days long. maybe that has something to do with it? I wouldn't worry too much.
BabyBumps X Ugh, yes! So painful. I'm 34 weeks and I'm pretty sure he's lying directly on my tailbone, pushing down on my bowels. Last two nights I woke up in the middle of the night and had to whimper myself onto my hands and knees to try to relieve the pressure. Really haven't figured out what to do about it yet. 
TwoXChromosomes X Good news!  Start taking a 28-day cycle birth control pill, move on to a new pack every three weeks instead of taking the fourth week placebo pills, and enjoy being period-free.  There are even some brands designed for skipping periods.  I think with Seasonique you only have four periods a year.  The downsides are that this can get a little expensive, and possibly spotting.  Better than a hysterectomy, no?
TwoXChromosomes X I had an Implanon inserted 4 months ago. During the first month after insertion, I had what seemed to be two periods. But then my body adjusted to the hormones, and I've had no periods since then. An acquaintance also has the Implanon, and similarly experiences this side effect of being period-free.  I got mine at PP for about $900. It's among the more expensive BC options, but one lasts for 3 years. Plus, I don't have to worry about skipping pills. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think someone who tries to force you into possibly keeping an unwanted pregnancy deserves to be inconvenienced similarly. After all, why should he RUIN HER LIFE by forcing her to give birth to a child she's not ready to raise?
TwoXChromosomes X It is about as safe as it gets for avoiding pregnancy, but without a condom, you can get an STD.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, while most female birth control methods are higher efficiency than condoms alone-they are not 100% effective against pregnancy. The pill is just 99%, thats ONE WHOLE NUMBER LESS! Goodness!    For srs, you can still get pregnant from what you're doing. It's veryveryveryveryhalfwaytoimpossible rare, but there is always a chance. Adding condoms to the equation is only protecting yourself more. Lets face it-it's always better to be paranoid and take extra precaution than losing sleep so that you can make an appointment at the clinic the *second* it opens because you're panicking.   I've been there, it's terrifying. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you're consistently and correctly using birth control pills, your risk of pregnancy is much lower than if you just used condoms and no pill. EVEN if you don't pull out.  I will assume that you and your partner(s) are getting tested regularly for STDs.
TwoXChromosomes X Urinate beforehand (which is good practice anyway). Lay down towels so you don't have to worry about any spills. Let go and enjoy yourself.  I often feel I need to pee when I get close to orgasm. I just let go and enjoy it and I have never peed. I've orgasmed a lot though :)
TwoXChromosomes X "Safe" depends on how much you really, really don't want to get pregnant.  The pull out method is hardly less effective than condoms when done correctly (96% versus 98% perfect use), and even most traditional birth control methods alone are mere percentage points away from 100%.  Depends if that extra few percent matters to you in addition to the safety of your pill.
TwoXChromosomes X I was keeping track of my basal body temperature in order to conceive. Your temperature is supposed to go up 1-2 days after ovulating, and most books say that once your temperature goes up; it's too late. Well, I conceived the day my temperature went up. (We didn't have sex for about seven days before then.)  
TwoXChromosomes X My husband stopped using protection.  I figured that meant he must want a child since I told him that his vigilance is the only thing preventing pregnancy.  She's 4 years old now and everyone has been pretty happy about it from the start.  
TwoXChromosomes X the only way you could be pregnant is if there were pre-ejaculate on his penis, which is possible. if your test was negitive then its unlikley that you're pregnant. go to your local planned parenthood, or your doctor to get a proper test. false negatives are much less common than false positives, the chances of you actually being pregnant are slim to none. but get a test to put yourself at ease
BabyBumps X My sister went 21 days late with her second.  She tried every single thing to stimulate labor, walking, acupuncture, sex, nipple stimulation, herbs, teas.  Nothing seemed to work.  They were going to induce her the next day, but she finally went into labor!  She thought she was broken and was going to stay pregnant forever!  She also had a midwife and a homebirth.  Everything went fine.  Good luck!  Some mamas just take a little extra time!
TwoXChromosomes X Your wife should check her cycle as to when she's fertile. When I was trying to get pregnant, I eventually worked out that my cycle wasn't the standard, and that I ovulated well before what is average.  I used mucus consistency [see changes in cervical mucus]( ) and got pregnant pretty much immediately.   Best of luck with whatever route you take.
TwoXChromosomes X Mitosis isn't the most common for advanced life. Your cells most use mitosis to reproduce, but they can't survive without your body. While it may be common for bacteria, viruses and cells, it can't be used for animals which is what were more concerned about.
BabyBumps X Ask your caregiver for recommendations. Also, depending on where you're at, they may do vaginal breech, but lots of places are automatic cesarean with a breech.  In the clinic I work in, we don't start trying to get Baby to turn until about 34 weeks, because earlier than that, it's easier for Baby to go back to breech. You can try things like putting a light or music down by your pelvis, and putting something cold up top to try to get Baby to turn... or doing handstands in a pool if you have access.  After 34 weeks, if the baby is still breech, we have the mom try acupuncture and chiropractic to turn the baby. As a last resort we'll send the mom for an external cephalic version, which is where a doctor tries to manually turn the baby on the outside, under ultrasound to monitor the baby.  In any case, express your concerns with your caregiver. :)
BabyBumps X EEk, that sounds painful! (manually turning the baby)  Ok, so I basically have time for this little boy to turn then. Its so annoying because his head is right under my boobs...it hurts to breathe!
BabyBumps X My birth class instructor said her baby didn't drop until 6 minutes before she started pushing! But she had pretty fast labors. It's different for all babies. 
TwoXChromosomes X My thoughts exactly! Of course the embryo is alive. It's not dead tissue. However, unless it's viable outside the womb, it's not a person.      
BabyBumps X I was tired last week.  This week I can't sleep.  It's alternating week to week I think.  (I've only known for about 3 weeks that I'm preggo)
TwoXChromosomes X If you are ending the life while it is only a collection of cells and has no consciousness or ability to feel pain, I don't think it is objectionable. I am pro- choice but my gut feeling is that abortion is less "okay" the further into the pregnancy you are.
TwoXChromosomes X lump it?  Pads are gross, however, if you change them regularly it's really not that bad.  Look , it is what it is...i'd rather a little discomfort with a pad (depending on the days task) than the pain of a tampon...
TwoXChromosomes X It might be too much estrogen for you. If you find other symptoms, such as breaking out as well as nausea, I'd ask for a lower estrogen-level BC. I have the same effects, so I have LoEstrin when I'm in BC, it was the only one that worked the best for me and didnt give me weird side effects :) Even helped with my iron deficiency. 
Parenting X My wifes lactation consultant was so ani-formula that she tried to convince us to throw away the formula that the hospital provided. My wife could barely breastfeed so we had no choice but to use formula. I just wanted to tell her to GTFO.
TwoXChromosomes X Everyone is different! I just had my IUD removed after a year of HELL periods, horrible cramps, pain, and bleeding every time I had sex. It was the worst and I wish I never got it!!   buuut I am glad your body seems to be handling it well. It is really nice not to have to worry about birth control daily. 
Parenting X I breastfed for barely 2 weeks and my daughter didn't get sick until after she turned 1. Formula fed babies can be just as healthy or healthier than breastfed and vice versa.
TwoXChromosomes X Really.  I'm 20 weeks pregnant now, and can't wait to be a mother.  This was an intended pregnancy, and we intend to have at least one more in the next few years. 
Parenting X Better start working on your "terrible dad puns" now. My son was planned and it took 9 months to conceive, so my husband had a year and a half to work on the... delivery, nudge nudge, get it?  Congratulations! Life will never be the same... but you'll quickly forget what it was like before baby.
TwoXChromosomes X Sorry for the delay...let me see. I got a prescription for a bucketload of ibuprofen and I took that for four days. After that, normal amounts of Advil kept the cramping down.  I had my next normal period in about four weeks. It was totally regular after that.  I got an IUD about two months after the abortion. No worries since then. I got the copper IUD and for a while I had bloodier and crampier periods, but that's gotten better. Talk to your doctor about what works best for you. If nothing else, try layering methods - BC pill and spermicidal sponge, for example. Best of luck to you!
Parenting X I'm a Canadian, so I'm not 100% sure on this one, but I wrote some workplace training for a US-based company several years ago and remember hearing about the [Family Medical Leave Act]( -leave/fmla.htm). Depending on where you wife works, it looks like she may be able to take 12 weeks unpaid leave. I'm not sure if that's in addition to the 6 weeks she's already eligible for.  Also, even if she does quit her job, it doesn't have to be forever. If you can, just sock away as much as possible for now to self-fund a maternity leave, and then maybe she can return to the job market several months or a year or two later.
TwoXChromosomes X It's not really an option for me. I can barely afford to terminate the pregnancy let alone go full term and give birth. 
Parenting X FMLA allows for 12 weeks unpaid.  You can use accrued vacation and sick time at most places, and certain union employees have additional benefits.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Until the thing can survive on it's own,  I suspect this was an error and will assume you mean specifically a fetus that cannot survive outside the womb. So if/when medical technology is such that a fetus can survive from conception until nine months outside the womb, you think abortion should be illegal?
TwoXChromosomes X I have a friend who will NOT test positive for a pregnancy test at all....even when she was 8 months and showing! Also, I went with out a period lots of time; once for six months and the doctor said I have PCOS. You might want to look up the signs for it. Thats all I got.
TwoXChromosomes X I had the Mirena.  My periods before that were very painful and heavy, so I was recommended the Mirena.  It was also way way cheaper ($80 plus $10 for meds.)
TwoXChromosomes X What you're talking about sounds more like the bacterial vaginosis - generally yeast infections are uncomfortable and kinda icky, but they don't really smell much.  I think your ob/gyn is just taking a wild guess on that "sloughing faster, etc." thing.  I had a problem with this that finally cleared up after I got an abscessed tooth and was given some serious mega-doses of antibiotics.  I think it must have been a bacterial infection that just laughed at the normal rounds of antibiotics.  That's my best guess, anyway.  The yogurt suggestion is good; also you can buy the yogurt cultures in a capsule form (in case you don't want to eat lots of yogurt) - be sure to buy the kind that has to stay refrigerated.  There are also cranberry extract capsules that work pretty well, though maybe not as well as the real cranberry juice.  Oh, and for washing down there, try to find some basic, unscented soap at the health food store.  The "shower bars" that they sell at the grocery are actually detergent bars and the strong artificial scents they add can be very irritating to sensitive areas.  Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X I consider myself generally pretty sex-positive, so your mileage with other people may vary, but I'd probably see if we could talk about it with a health care professional about your particular chances of transmission, and use barrier methods. I'm developing the attitude of the female condom being the best thing ever, and it decreases the risk of STI transmission even more than male condoms do, so hope you're down with them!
TwoXChromosomes X For me, bad cramps are like having a dull blade scrape out the inside of my uterus. Sometimes I also have a bad ache in my lower back, too. Fortunately, I rarely get bad cramps anymore...
TwoXChromosomes X Ha, that's what you think. Let's find the figures. 8% of all pregnancies that make it to week 6 miscarriage. , were happy to be pregnant, and then they lose the pregnancy.   But it makes clear that a 6 wk pregnancy in no way has a 100% chance to develop into a baby. 
TwoXChromosomes X No matter when you get your period, you should still take your pills consistently as you normally would which generally means 3 weeks active + 1 week placebo/no pills.  You can always skip your placebo pill week if you desire, but this may just screw up your period even further.  It depends on the type of pill, but within a half hour window should be fine and does not constitute missing a pill.  My pill (ortho cyclen) for example says a pill is "missed" if you take it more than 3 hours either way, although of course it's best to take it very close to the same time everyday.  Reading your pill information may help with exactly how long would mean you missed a pill and whether or not to use backup, but I would think that this is not what's screwing up your periods, try asking your doctor about the erratic periods, although I don't think it's something you need to be concerned about in terms of protection.   
TwoXChromosomes X Not to scare you, but I would take a pregnancy test during your placebo,regular period time. This happened to me, and I thought it was just stress and whatnot, so I took it as my period. I found out a month later that I was already 2 months pregnant. So it doesn't hurt to take a test just to be sure =) Taking the pill within a 1-2 hour time frame should still be just fine. But try to stay on track with them as much as possible. 
TwoXChromosomes X I would say they are more awkward than anything else. The sensation is weird, but only a little bit more sensation than a tampon. And then you don't have to do it for another year.   Also be upfront about your fears with your doctor. You can have the nicest doctor ever but they can better be your gyno doctor if you tell them the situation.  If it is your first time then usually they walk you through what is happening. And if it hurts for some reason tell them and they will make it stop.
TwoXChromosomes X They will probably allow your boyfriend in - I know when I was younger I was allowed to have my mother in the exam room, so it shouldn't be a big deal. The actual exam should take just a few minutes. It does not hurt, exactly - just a little surprising, but the pressure part of it (the only part that could be considered painful) only lasts a second. Tell your doctor that it's your first time and that you're a little worried: the doctor is used to this and knows how to deal with it. This is a very common problem with women.  You should definitely go get it done. It's important for your sexual health, etc, and it's really not that bad at all.   Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I was nervous about my first time.  It doesn't hurt at all, it just is unpleasant.  The sensation is difficult to explain but it feels like a mascara brush being gently rubbed on your cervix. If you are nervous, have a beer, take some mild anxiety medication, or whatever you use to calm your nerves.  You'll do just fine. :) Have your boyfriend take you to your appointment so you don't have to wait in the waiting room alone.    It won't hurt, it won't take more than a minute and you will be relieved to know that you are healthy. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I have a super light flow, if I changed my tampon every time I went pee I'd be pulling out a basically dry tampon.
TwoXChromosomes X I've always changed it (when I used tampons) every time I peed because I didn't want to chance losing some absorbency (tampon soaking up pee) and risk leaking period blood.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not a virgin, I just struggle with getting tampons in there. Lol. I switched to the washable pads because it's more environmentally friendly and I couldn't really see myself using the diva cup because of how much trouble I have with tampons. I don't know if my muscles just tense up or if it's just a position thing. :( 
BabyBumps X My friend just had a baby turn away from breech at 38 weeks! She just delivered vaginally on Tuesday this week :)  My grandma had a footling breech, which she delivered at home with no complications.   Most babies will not settle into the head-down position until sometime after 32 weeks, so you've got plenty of time. 
TwoXChromosomes X Probably. I don't think I'd really know the answer until it happened but probably. I trust my SO and whilst he can be a bit unorganised at times I think he's take something like this extremely seriously. I may continue to take my pill as well (it's super cheap and not that much of a bother) but if I missed one or had to go on antibiotics for some reason I'd probably trust his pill and not bother with extra precautions (condoms etc). 
TwoXChromosomes X This isn't rationing of healthcare, it's actually based on the science that when you're young you often have a positive test when it is something your body would clear on it's own which leads to unnecessary treatment. Any history of cervical cancer and you can get them earlier.   It's like having your breasts scanned from a certain age upwards in AUS unless other signs or abnormalities are present. 
TwoXChromosomes X What is missing from this discussion is an evaluation of the rights of the fetus.  The mother was going to die soon; should not the fetus have a chance at life, notwithstanding its mother's irrationality?  Certainly, the doctors acted inappropriately, but the mother was the most to blame.  If, by declining the procedure, the mother had a chance to live, it would be a very different matter; however, she was terminally ill and was needlessly endangering the life of her child.
TwoXChromosomes X I have PCOS too.  I hadn't had my period for 2 months when I started on the pill. I am pretty sure that you can just start taking it and the body will sort itself out. I think the instructions for when to take it are more for people who have regular periods than for those with irregular or non-existant. I am not a doctor though. I know this is just what I started doing a few years ago and I haven't had any problems from just starting the pill whenever.  I did also have period symptoms (mostly PMS and breakouts) before I went on the pill but no actual period. So I think this is quite normal for PCOS.  Also the soulcysters forums have some great information about PCOS if you haven't already stumbled open it.
TwoXChromosomes X I am in Australia so I don't know if you have the same creams as we get here. The one I normally get is a pill/cream combo Canestan. There should be similar there. Just ask the pharmacist :)
TwoXChromosomes X I also have PCOS, and I was on the pill just to regulate my schedule for awhile.  You don't absolutely have to wait until your period - I waited almost three months and didn't get one, so I just started taking pills from the beginning of a pack, and when I got to the last row...well they worked, and they keep me regular.  Yay!   Seriously, start birth control, I never realized how nice it was to know exactly what day your period starts, rather than random surprises every once in awhile.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, you can start taking the pill. The only thing is, that it won't protect you from pregnancy in the first 28 days. For that, you would have to start on the first day of your menstruation. So just start, use condoms for the next month if you have sex, and from the first stop week / placebo week / menstruation the pregnancy protection of the pill starts.
TwoXChromosomes X IMPORTANT: It's fine to start taking the pill at any point in your cycle, but you should use condoms or something until you've completed a cycle on the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been frequenting soulcysters for a while and it is a really great place for information and other people's experiences.  Also, it is very encouraging to hear from the women that were able to get pregnant when they wanted to...something you really don't get from just talking to a doctor.  When I found out I had PCOS 6-7 years ago, I hadn't had a period for 6 months.  I was started on a BC pill and I had my period regular in 2 months.  Don't worry if it isn't regular right away, sometimes it takes 2 or 3, sometimes 4 months for your body to adjust to being regular.  
TwoXChromosomes X But having a Mirena won't change hormone cycling.  While my periods are certainly lighter, I still get the same PMS every month, which I'm guessing is really what OPs problem is.  It isn't her period itself, but rather the cycling of her hormones directly prior to her period.
TwoXChromosomes X I can't take estrogen because it makes my blood pressure go up and gives me migraines.  I tried the mini pill and I didn't care for it, progesterone only made me really depressed.  I'd look at non-hormonal methods if this one doesn't work out.  I felt so much better after I stopped taking hormonal birth control. *edited* clarity
BabyBumps X I would drink a lot of red raspberry leaf tea and insert evening primrose as well as take it orally. Lots of sex if you can handle it (prostaglandins in semen help ripen the cervix). I'd be doing everything I could to get that cervix ripe and ready, and strengthen/tone the uterus. I was induced with my first at 42 weeks and it was horrible. With my second we tried everything (acupuncture, everything) and had no success. When I reached 41w3d I tried a special shake to "naturally" induce labour (including some castor oil) that worked like a charm, but I was already overdue, and everything was good to go--I don't think it would work nearly so well if your body and your baby is not yet ready.  I will keep you in my thoughts and hope for a good outcome. I wish I had better advice, but my induction was for being post-dates and I do not know anything about getting labour started when the body may not yet be ready. :(
TwoXChromosomes X Don't put the decision in your boyfriend's hands, you will be the one who has to live with the decision even if you don't want to. If you think you are likely to feel guilty, as it seems you do, then you probably aren't ready to go and get an abortion yet. Make sure you feel good about your choice. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think we need to know more about HPV outside of the Guardasil commercials.  Namely that it's more common than we think and there is no test for guys.  My experience with an abnormal pap and HPV was just awful thanks to a doc with horrible bedside manner and lack of education.  I had the colposcopy and have been going back for my every 3 month re-pap.  Sometimes I think it's a sham to get more money from me, but I'm not willing to take that risk with my health.  Paps for everyone!
TwoXChromosomes X Basically, "most" adults who are sexually active contract HPV at some point in their lives. It is that common.  I suggest getting vaccinated for the really nasty strains (the ones that cause cancer), and otherwise don't worry too much about it.  Skin to skin contact is what spreads HPV, it has nothing to do with the sperm. Wearing a condom can help limit contact, but even then you're still encountering a lot of potential opportunities to contract the virus. Honestly, the vast majority of HPV cases are no big deal. They go away on their own over time, and almost everyone gets it.  
TwoXChromosomes X yes for a long time people thought that PCOS caused the endo problems rather then the endo and the pcos being part of the same issue.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine were fine until about age 18... now they're unbearable x__x Exhausted, cramping, bitchy PMS 3 days before...
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah. Generally besides bleeding I hardly notice a difference. Sometimes I get a bit bloated or have cramps right at the beginning, but it is nothing really bothersome.  I don't think my emotions change at all and the only reason I am horny is because we don't have sex during my period. (Blood makes my bf feel ill.)
TwoXChromosomes X No problem :) I just emphasize the cleaning part, but I'm sure most men don't want their junk to be dirty :P just that with the extra bit of skin, crap can collect in there and stink up the place. Sounds gross, but we as a species are pretty nasty lol
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I wouldn't force that woman to give birth against her will.   But the logical conclusion of not forcing the woman to give birth against her will is killing an organism that is the exact same as a borne child (other than mere birth). I understand the position, I am just shocked you judge the humanity of a fetus based on whether it is borne or not; the birth of which, alone, does not change the physical or mental nature of the fetus.
TwoXChromosomes X Just call him back and point out that he didn't give you enough time to adjust to the birth control.  Don't let him throw away something that could be good for both of you.  Just make a mental note that sometimes he acts hastily and see if it'll work out.  Explain how the birth control affects you so that he'll know what to look out for while you're adjusting.  edit: also, maybe you should consider going on a lower-dose birth control.  LoestrinFe worked great for me and had minimal emotional side effects.
Parenting X Try putting it in a nipple from a bottle next time.  Not the bottle, mind you, just the nipple. 
TwoXChromosomes X What about a diaphragm and spermicide? I've never had a kid but I'm getting a hormonal coil inserted soon. (1My bf refers to it as a 'baby shredder'! ) They fit it during your flow and give you tablets to soften up and open the cervix to insert before hand.  
TwoXChromosomes X The arm implant uses synthetic progesterone only, so it doesn't have the risks and side-effects that are associated with estrogen. All hormonal options do have risks and side effects though, so be aware of them and talk them over with your doctor. The arm implant may be a lower dose of hormones than many of the pills.  Condoms also make clean-up a breeze. I never find them a hassle to put on my husband - it's all part of the fun and foreplay, and it only takes a few seconds. He likes to use condoms because he doesn't want a baby, and he can be in control of his fertility just like I am with my Depo Provera injection.
TwoXChromosomes X Basically:  A [diva cup (US)]( )/[moon cup (UK)]( ) is a silicone cup that you put in your vagina to catch menstruation.  Typically it can hold up to 0.5 - 1.0 oz of blood (the average woman loses up to 2 oz of blood per cycle) though I start leaking when my cup gets half full. D:  So, benefits:  - Since it's made of silicone, you don't run the risk of TSS.  - It's recyclable:  You clean it out on a daily basis and boil it out (as needed) after your period, so it's a one-time investment.  - You don't have to worry about "having another one on you" - it's already there, it's ready to go.  - You can leave it in til it's full, which allows you to change/empty it when it's convenient.  According to my gyno, I could leave it in for my entire period if my flow was light enough.  - I know there was a whole health scare awhile ago about how much processing goes into tampons (that they're full of bleach and whatnot) and I have no idea how true those claims are.  But at least you don't have to worry about it with this thing since it's silicone.  - You can put it in BEFORE your period starts since there's no risk of TSS.  This has been a lifesaver several times.  Disadvantages:  - Removing it and cleaning it can be... messy.  As in, blood-all-over-your-hands messy.  I got over that pretty quickly though.  You may end up emptying it in a public restroom - as long as you use TP to clean the blood off your hands prior to exiting the stall, no one can tell.  I generally empty it on 8-10 hour intervals, so I'm able to start in the morning, empty it after work, empty it before bed as needed, rinse repeat the next day.  - If you don't put it in properly (there IS somewhat of a trick to it, though you get used to it fast) there is a chance of severe leakage.  I just wear pantyliners when I use it.  Then I can typically "feel" when I'm...wet... and I'm not supposed to be, so I know something is wrong.
TwoXChromosomes X You've had a period since the last time you had sex, so it's really, *really* unlikely that you're pregnant. There are a lot of reasons for missing a period that are much more likely to be the cause. Stress, the diet (change in lifestyle), hormone imbalance, etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X On the other hand 9 out of 10 births proceed just fine, so there must be a way to compromise between a highly medicalized, impersonal hospital birth and a totally hands-off homebirth.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I found slightly turning to one side made it so much easier to push and I got yelled at for it.   That is so bizarre to me. I gave birth in a hospital with a midwife and nurse in attendance, and they were both *encouraging* me to move around as much as possible, even during contractions. They had me try *all sorts* of positions to see what worked best.
TwoXChromosomes X Still, you should make sure the blood panel is as accurate as possible because it could be crucial in diagnosing you with something else. My doctor thought I had Celiac disease but the blood test told them that it was Ulcerative Colitis. If I had not known that, my life would have been (even more) miserable.  It's important to know as much as you can about your health, trust me! :)
TwoXChromosomes X A lot of those were due to incompetent midwives. Fortunately these are rare, but the stories are sad none-the-less. This is why when I have kids I will have them at home with a nurse midwife, who have nationally recognized and regulated education and is legal in, I believe, all states. I am also going to become a CNM (cert. nurse midwife) when I get older, and attend home births and out of hospital birth center births.  DEM Midwives are regulated by state and the education varies from state to state. Some staes have very low standards and so these midwives just don't necessarily have all the training they need. There are bad midwives and great midwives, just like there are bad OBGYNS and great OBGYNS.
TwoXChromosomes X i've read in some sources that you should get a yearly pap test, and in others that you should get a pap test once every three years (assuming the last test was negative.)  um...about how often should a sexually active 20-something get a pap test, is what i'm asking you. does it depend on whether or not you're monogamous as well? 
TwoXChromosomes X It's not fair to compare 2% to 33% -- midwives don't accept women who are at high risk, so the hospitals get women who have (1) previously had a c-section, (2) breech babies, (3) placenta previa, (4) are obese, etc. Hospitals may end up with unnecessary c-sections, but home-birth c-sections are artificially low.  I think it's also important to not villainize epidurals. My sister, for instance, after 18 hours of labor, got an epidural -- and it allowed her to sleep for the first time in 48 hours, so that she was able to go through the rest of the birth without needing a c-section. She was also better able to bond with the baby, as she was not as exhausted once the baby was born.  Birth is natural, but humans have evolved in such a way (in order to stand upright) that it is very dangerous compared to most animals. Babies have to rotate through the birth canal. In addition, human baby brains (and therefore skulls) are much larger than for most animals, exacerbating the problem.
BabyBumps X You could see if can find a doula in your area. Most are also childbirth educators and might me willing to help supplement learning from books, videos.  From my personal experience having a natural labor with no meds is almost impossible without some good preparation and education before hand. And a doula is a HUGE asset to having a natural labor too. 
TwoXChromosomes X That was an option we discussed, but neither of us thinks it's a cyst.  I've had several in the past, both cervical and ovarian, and none have felt like this.   It's bizarre, but it feels like there's basically a golf ball, or something about that size, stuck inside of me right there.  I hope it's something as simple and benign as a cyst, though.    I'd seriously hate to find out that it's an ectopic pregnancy and I lose function on the left side.  =(  
TwoXChromosomes X Sometimes, like every few months or so, mine just get that way. It doesn't have to be close to my period or anything. It didn't start happening until I got into my twenties.  It does usually mean I'm going to have a rougher period (more symptoms) than usual, though.
TwoXChromosomes X For me, I would have died from seizures due to pre-eclampsia. And my son would have died because he wouldn't be born. Or, if they somehow got him out, he would have died because he would have stopped breathing (he had to be intubated). But that's not really a fair example, because he was delivered at 32.5 weeks, and so he never could have been a homebirth.
TwoXChromosomes X The determination if something is cancerous is if it has invaded surrounding tissue. [Let's start with this pic]( ). You can clearly see the 2 layers. Between the 2 layers is something called a basement membrane. Let's say a dysplatic process starts in the darker purple layer. Basically, some funky looking cells start growing and multiplying, but it's all within the darker purple layer. This is the scenario that's happening when your doc tells you you have abnormal cells. Carcinoma in-situ (CIS) means that that the abnormal cells have taken up the entire layer, but have not crossed the basement membrane and invaded the surrounding tissue. This scenario is still not cancer, but has a greater chance of becoming cancerous. While CIS is not cancer, it needs taken care of right away! Once the funky cells cross the basement membrane and invade the surrounding tissue, BAM, that's cancer. The cells also become more funky the greater the dysplasia, which is what I look for. The pap test looks at the individual cells to see if anything funky is going on. To determine *exactly* how severe the dysplasia is the docs do a colposcopy and biopsy.   [Here's a decent pic of the stages and cells.]( )  In general, the term precancerous is used for CIS. I say generally because terminology can vary from office to office. If your doc ever tells you you have abnormal cells or precancerous cells, ask what the exact diagnosis is. To me, saying you have abnormal or precancerous cells is a bit vague and leaves a lot to the imagination, IE easily freaked out.  
TwoXChromosomes X Congratulations, but I hope you took notice of the comments on your other post about seeing a vulvar pain specialist.  There is further treatment available than just trying to insert things. A pelvic floor physiotherapist may be the appropriate treatment provider once you are diagnosed by a knowledgeable doctor. A urogynaecologist understands sexual pain and will be able to test for many conditions.  In my case, my vaginal muscles are very short and tight even when fully relaxed. My PC muscle feels like bone. I am receiving intra-vaginal massage to remove the knots in my muscle. There are lots of external treatments they can do too if you are not ready for internal work.  I am also getting the muscles in the rest of my body worked by a massage therapist, because they are all knotted too, which doesn't help my pelvic tension. Before treatment I couldn't even squat down to 90 degrees. Now, with the help of a wall for back support and balance, I can squat down entirely and have my butt on the floor with my feet flat on the ground. This is a good stretch for the pelvic floor too.  [This]( ) is a great book, demonstrating physiotherapy techniques you can use on yourself or in conjunction with a pelvic floor physiotherapist.
BabyBumps X Your recovery sounds much better than mine from a vaginal birth. If my next baby is anywhere near as big as this one was I am planning to request a c-section. I've just had such a hard time. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've been on hormonal birth control for 13 years.  Without wishing to be overly graphic, my boyfriend has to fight me off most of the time.  Ignorance over the side effects of birth control is frankly staggering.  There are LOTS of types and they are all different.  If one doesn't work - change it.  There are (as I've said elsewhere) non-hormonal birth controls.  She doesn't seem to want to talk about those either.
BabyBumps X I totally understand what you are saying. Before my birth experience I would have totally agreed with you. After what I went through I will be looking specifically for a doctor who will allow a scheduled c-section if at the end my baby is large. I tried many of the things you suggested above, perennial massage, laboring in the water, counter pressure etc. I tore because after 3 days of labor I was exhausted and needed help pushing him out.   Now, at my follow up appointment, they found placenta still inside of me and I need to have a D&amp;C.  Please reserve your judgement. Everyone's labor is different. After experiencing mine I know what I want next time. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yaz is commonly prescribed for acne. Lots of times you'll react differently to different types of birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X We have only ever used condoms in the six years we have been together and there have been no slips, breaks, scares etc. For us they have worked perfectly
TwoXChromosomes X Keep in mind that drinking lots of cranberry juice can irritate your urethra! Well, anything that's acidic. Pop or coffee are the usual culprits if it's not cranberry juice.
TwoXChromosomes X Hey, if they can create a law where a women or a men can remove her or himself from parenthood after the fact, then sure.  The chances of that happening are slim to nil, however.  Do you advocate better, accessible birth control methods for women and men outside of sterilization?  Do you advocate sexual education that will educate our young women and men on how to protect themselves from not only STIs, but unwanted pregnancies?
TwoXChromosomes X It's painful, but I can't pinpoint where and what kind of pain. Stabbing? No. Throbbing? No. Radiating? No. It's just pain. 
TwoXChromosomes X You can start whenever you want, BUT, unless ~~you're on your period/last day of your~~ you start taking the pills within the first five days after starting your period, you gotta wait anywhere from 1 week-2 weeks (check your pill instruction booklet) to have condom-free sexytimes.   In other words, if you start now, you won't be fully protected by next week, so you'll need to use a back-up method (i.e., condoms).   Maybe try the all-natural non-latex condoms? They might help with less irritation. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't mind my period. I'm similar to you, in that I don't PMS, I cramp rarely (more now that I have a copper IUD, but still minimal), I bleed a normal amount. I'm chubby anyway so don't notice any bloating, everything is fairly normal.
TwoXChromosomes X basically you're gunna have to get it online. I'm a 34DD (nothing to you but still a problem being that i'm only 17 &amp; 5'2") but VictoriaSecrets only sells tops up to a 32C when i went into the store, but their online store had up to like 40DD so, online for sure.
Parenting X If she nurses, it is really a commitment for both of you. It takes a lot of time and the hormones make you sleepy.  Other than that, I say see what your daughter likes. She may or may not like being swaddled, for example. Try different bottles till you find just the right one for her. Different diapers. Etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X Have you considered implanon or the patch? I've never used either (the pill works for me) but they may be worth looking in to, since there aren't too many other options.
Parenting X Breast is Best, but the zealotry for it is now sometimes overwhelming common sense - if mom isn't making enough milk then OF COURSE you use formula! Milk is better than Formula, but Formula is still better than insufficient food.  Some nurses and midwives especially are not even telling Moms about formula or sending them home with any now.  Supplementing mild with formula is pretty ideal early on if needed. 
TwoXChromosomes X I use "My period and ovulation tracker" and it has symptoms, moods, ovulation, fertile days, temp, weight, sexual activity, and anything else you want to add can go in the notes section.   I highly recommend!
TwoXChromosomes X My PT tracker tracks symptoms...  This is the one I use. You can track your moods, symptoms and period on it. It's a bit cutesy but it's free and it tracks everything. _app_my_period__ovulation_tracker/6605082221424607586
TwoXChromosomes X Very commonly used. A lot of people use pads and tampons together so that the pad can absorb any accidental leakage. I always use a pad+tampon when I sleep so I don't wake up to a nasty surprise all over my sheets.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. Pads are alright, I just hate the hassle of using them in public restrooms. Too noisy, while tampons are more discrete.  But the dryness... :c Cups all the way. 
TwoXChromosomes X Women can get ticketed for indecent exposure if they show their breasts in public. There are only a handful of beaches, if that, that allow women to go topless. I really like the Penn and Teller Bullshit! episode on how America is making such a big deal about Boobs.  I don't get it. When a women breast feeds in public, she doesn't just whip it out, there is usually a cloth draped over the shoulder hiding the boob and baby. As much as men love to joke around about sucking on milk engorged breasts, the actual act of breastfeeding is still found to be gross. Seriously?! There's nothing to see! She's feeding her baby, who cares?
TwoXChromosomes X Idk about where you are, but in CA assault (or battery, I can't remember which) is defined by one person's unwanted touching of another person. By grabbing you, he had already committed assault, you were just attempting to defend yourself. Nothing crazy about that.
TwoXChromosomes X I use cloth liners as a back up, and my period is 7-8 days long and sometimes after a while the cup just gets irritating as I have cysts inside.  So I have to quit using it and use pads.  
TwoXChromosomes X im a tampon user too, and nah im pretty sure pads work like diapers. But i hear they have reusable pads that you wash..
Parenting X Same experience here.  Most of our sippy cups don't have "openings", they have special valves that stop any water coming out unless someone's sucking on the other end.  Which of course happily leak if there's a change in pressure on the outside of the bottle.
TwoXChromosomes X I had an abnormal pap that lead to a colposcopy which lead to HPV and a biopsy which lead to precancer.  I had the precancer removed and have been perfectly healthy for years now!  i wouldn't worry too much about it until you get your colposcopy.  
TwoXChromosomes X Jolivette, a minipill (progestin only). It's awesome.  Check out the literature on side effects if there's any particular worries you have: some pills are more likely to prevent weight loss or help acne, for instance.  But hormones work very differently for most women, so just try something for a few months and don't worry if you need to keep search for the perfect pill!
TwoXChromosomes X Okay. A yeast infection would almost be better (less medication, pain going away faster). Sometimes the infection becomes resistant to antibiotics so you might need a different type of antibiotics or more of them. Also, if you can, ask what type of infection you have. If it's a E Coli cranberry juice/ pills will help but if it's another type of UTI it won't do anything. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Just here to warn you if you feel pain in the kidneys to get to your doctor immediately. My UTI spread to my kidneys and hospitalized me.  had to take antibiotics through an IV to get rid of it all.
TwoXChromosomes X The [pill]( -topics/birth-control/birth-control-effectiveness-chart-22710.htm) is pretty effective when used correctly. Just make sure your doctor knows about all the other medications you may be on, and talks to you about possible interactions. Anti-convulsant medications (which may also be prescribed for migraines and mood disorders) especially hate estrogen based birth control. 
TwoXChromosomes X My experiences weren't that bad.  The first time, my water broke at home, and I went through almost 24 hours of labor before they decided to do a section (I hadn't dialated at all, so clearly I wasn't going to have the baby naturally).  I had already had an epidural, which they increased to a spinal block.  I couldn't feel anything, which was fine.  I was on the table in the surgical suite, yes, my arms were strapped down, too, which wasn't an issue since I couldn't feel them.  I talked to my husband the whole time, who was far more nervous than I was.  I freaked out after she was born, because I couldn't feel my chest moving, so I thought I wasn't breathing (a little psychological terror implanted by a woman I knew).  They knocked me out completely, and I woke up 4 hours later in recovery.  They kept me fully drugged up through the next day to prevent pain (lovely).  It's worth mentioning that I had pre-ecplamsia, and my blood pressure was very high .. I was kept in bed for several days while this was dealt with.  My next two were incredibly easy .. Planned in advance, so no repeats of labor.  A quick epidural, and the job was done.  Kid out and off the nursery for weighing/measuring, and me off to recovery.  I was up and walking by the next day after these two, and the most difficult part of recovering was having kids at home already.  My awesome husband took two weeks off to help out, and bring the baby to me when she needed to nurse.  I've heard so many people talk about how much easier vaginal childbirth is, and how they were up and exercising that evening .. Not possible with a section.  But, my experiences weren't that stressful.  I did have a bunch of (nursing) students come check out my final birth and tend to me after, but I had no problem with that .. they have to learn somehow, and three kids later, there's really nothing to be shy about.  Before I had my first, I was dedicated to a child-free life (and had been told I'd never be able to have kids).  I understand the disgust associated with listening to or watching birth.  However, from the flip side, it really wasn't that bad.  I didn't know about my first pregnancy until well into it, and didn't really have time to "bond" with my firstborn.  It took many weeks for me to find a comfort zone.  With my second and third, I was excited from the beginning, and loved them from the moment I saw them, which is so incredibly strong that it truly bypasses the experience of birth, making it nonexistent.  I think that's why so many people can and do have more than one child ... The experiences after make you senile.  :D
TwoXChromosomes X The pain of the first time varies from person to person. A lot of my girl friends said it hurt and a lot said it didn't. For me it hurt but no more than someone pinching my arm. I think experiencing pain down there is really unusual, so it can cause more panic/a reaction.   Having an understanding partner also helps! Take it easy and ask him to start off gently :)   And on a last note--I don't know if this is something to think about yet but some condoms can give you side effects like yeast infections/irritations. If you can, try going for a condom with lubricant but without spermicide.
TwoXChromosomes X  I'm a woman and I think menstruation is disgusting. You have the bloody walls of your uterus coming out of your vagina. Childbirth is a natural beautiful process but also involves blood, vaginal tearing, the woman defecating herself, people staring at your private bits. How is that not embarrasing and a little bit gross?
Parenting X I was fairly young when I got pregnant and they still suggested I do the Amniocentesis test. My husband and I decided that knowing either way wasn't going to change anything (we would never abort) so we didn't take the test. IMO intentionally raising the risk to the fetus isn't worth it if you have no intentions of terminating either way.
TwoXChromosomes X My sister tried to come in with me the first time, and purely for her own selfish reasons.  Thankfully, both my doctor and the hospital nurses were awesome.  My doctor asked me at one of my regular visits who I wanted in there, and the nurses asked me as soon as I was admitted to labor and delivery, writing it on my chart and barring everyone who wasn't on the list.  They even asked how long I wanted visitors to stay in l&amp;d, and would run people off when time was up.  They were vicious about it, and I was so grateful!
TwoXChromosomes X The good news is that some hospitals (even here in the midwest where I live) have jacuzzis in their labor and delivery rooms. Depending on the hospital some will and some won't allow you to have a water birth. Most have birthing balls and other helpful tools to make labor easier. Just do a lot of research on the place you think you'll deliver and that will ease your fears once you know your options. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I have always preferred male doctors. I grew up with a male GP and now have another male GP and male OBGYN...   Past history has taught me women to be less compassioate about female issues. I have only had pain during a pap smear by female doctors in college and by an emergency OB doctor.  My male doctor takes the time to warm up the speculum, warm his his hands, and applies ample lubricant for exams. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have that, too, and I LOVE it. I didn't need to be dilated, but it was pretty uncomfortable for a minute when they inserted it. No periods, no monthly cry-fests, no cramping, and sex all month long. :D
TwoXChromosomes X But why should it be her *choice* to put her life and her baby's life in danger? C-sections are dangerous, they should only be done when medically necessary (and we need to re-evaluate what that means, because a lot of "necessary c-sections" can be avoided) and choosing to have an elective c-section is putting your health, and baby's health at risk.  Same with elective inductions, those have risks. Even epidurals have risks, and those are handed out like candy. Same with pretty much every procedure done by an OB, right down to a cervical check.  Women need to get proper education about pregnancy and birth and be able to make informed choices about most things, and something just should not be an option unless absolutely necessary.
Parenting X reply to also add that after that 1 year off you are guaranteed your job, or a similar job at the same company back at the same pay.  Again, real labour laws.  Seriously America wtf.  Nothing is more important than the rearing of a child and as a Canadian 1 year isn't enough but at least it's more than 8 weeks...  Jesus.  8 weeks to have to leave your child to a stranger?  Fuck that shit.
Parenting X You should doublecheck with your employer about this.  Many companies don't interpret the law in such a way as to allow parents to break up their leave.
Parenting X For what its worth:  my brother's wife had the same amniocentesis test you're referring to, and two days later she miscarried.   It was really hard on them, she was pretty far along in her pregnancy too.   My wife (who was 35) and i followed the same path as you did, we did a few non invasive tests (not nearly all they recommended), but in the end it didn't matter what the results were (because none of them are 100%) we were having the baby regardless.
Parenting X &gt;Also, under 50 employees, with FMLA, they don't even have to guarantee her job for 4 weeks. They could fire her when she comes back, or even during her time off, no penalty.  Women sure have come a long way in America...  Honestly, fuck that shit.   Here in Canada a woman gets a full year off, with unemployment benefits.   And a woman cannot be fired for having a baby.   that job must be there when she returns.  The invisible hand of the market is well at work with nonsesne like this.  
TwoXChromosomes X The roll-ons are clear liquids that dry up and completely vanish.  No slime, white stuff, etc. You'd never know it's there.
Parenting X Ah. Exclusive breastfeeding actually means to the exclusion of everything else; food, formula, everything but medication really. So she was exclusively breastfed for 6 months. You don't hear of that many people exclusively breastfeeding past about 12 months, which is why I commented :)
TwoXChromosomes X I TOTALLY understand. I know I want to be a mom. I need to be a mom someday. But the process of pregnancy and birth kinda freaks me out a bit.
TwoXChromosomes X Also one thing I wish someone had told me when we stopped using condoms (and sorry if this embarrasses you): it is messy!! Make sure you have toilet paper to wad up after sex, and I always have panty liners I can pop in my knickers afterwards, otherwise you'll need to change!
TwoXChromosomes X AGREED. Medically, there's no reason. I take Gildess continuously in order to control my acne and not having periods is just an awesome side effect. I do get breakthrough bleeding sometimes though. 
TwoXChromosomes X Usually, laws offer both because otherwise it would be discriminatory.  Actually, maternity/paternity leave are both considered "short term disability leave".  So either a company offers paid short term disability leave to all its employees for all short term disabilities or it doesn't.
TwoXChromosomes X I use my laptop charger as a heat pad on my belly. It works wonders!
BabyBumps X Great statistic, considering midwives generally do not (or are not allowed by law depending on location) to take on any high-risk cases.  They deal with the simple low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries and then go on about how simple, low-risk, and uncomplicated their deliveries were.  Please.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't know about your period, but I've always used dollar store pregnancy tests on the advice of my doctor, and they've always been accurate. 
TwoXChromosomes X To each their own, but to be honest I'd rather deal with a piss-soaked tampon string than a full cup of my various menstrual oozings.
TwoXChromosomes X I use and love the diva cup... sometimes I combine it with thin cloth pads.  But I always hated tampons because I could feel them in there.  Honestly if you have the divacup in correctly, you don't feel it at all.  The only time I ever notice it is when I'm peeing.
Parenting X Precips are interesting. I didn't know it was precip because it was different from my first birth. I knew it was moving very fast, but it didn't sink in until a few hours after my son had been born.   With the next one I'm reading up on emergency childbirth just in case the midwife doesnt make it/I don't get to the hospital in time. :p
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; As long as you put the cup in soon enough, the walls of your vagina will not be like a crime scene.  This is so important. If you put the diva cup in before you start bleeding, you're all set. If you put it in, take it out, leave it out for a little while and then put it back in, you are SCREWED until you take a shower. Idk if it doesn't seal due to the extra moisture or if they accumulated blood underneath the cup just seeps out but it fucking sucks man.
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm my cervix feels like a fleshy hardish nub--it hurts if my boyfriend accidentally bonks the thing during sex.  Some women have pretty low cervixes but you could be hitting your g-spot, which is sort of spongey feeling (but different than the rest of your innards).    But the tissue there is very elastic anyway, so your boyfriend wouldn't hit your cervix usually even if it was pretty low.  There isn't really an effective way to easily measure your cervix--you might look at the cup size comparison and get one that is about in the middle in terms of size and hope it works out?  Diva cup fits fine for me, but some find it too long.
TwoXChromosomes X I had an extremely heavy flow before I got my IUD.  As long as I emptied it every two hours on heavy days, it wouldn't overflow.  This is why you need a backup pad in the beginning, it takes a bit to sort these things out.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never had a problem reaching orgasm, but what makes it *easiest* for me is:  * watching the porn I like (I love Andrew Blake's work because it's arty and girl-focused)  * using a vibrator on my clitoris - my fingers are sometimes distracting because they feedback the sensation  * not using internal stimulation - this makes things take longer for me  * relaxing and pampering myself  * breathing deeply and moaning when I feel like it  Can you usually orgasm with your partner?
TwoXChromosomes X I am almost 6 months in to the Mirena IUD and I still get (what I think is) PMS. Just kind of a general time of hormonal unease and pain/tiredness etc. I think I will have it taken out soon because of the randomness of the PMS symptoms and the bleeding. I know that the hindered ovulation *should* mean that we don't have a typical period but I sure know what you mean about not feeling like myself. I would almost prefer to be on nothing and then know when my PMS and period times were coming.
TwoXChromosomes X I know this is an old thread, but I've started taking Loestrin24 fe four days ago, on the first day of my period, which is usually very heavy and painful. I had nearly no cramps, and though it was rather heavy, today (the 4th day), it seems to have nearly stopped, even though mine usually last 6-7 days. I am having a bit of nausea in the evenings (I take it at 3 pm), but it's nothing horrible and it's usually better after a small snack or some juice.   If my periods keep getting this much better, the nausea will be worth it anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been on various forms of birth control for 10 years. I've continued to have PMS on each form, but it's always been fairly manageable.   I was on the ring for about 4 years, before recently switching to Implanon (and more for the long-term and cost benefits than any problems with the ring). I had PMS still, but again, always manageable. Nothing too crazy, and no problems with spotting.  Hope this helps!
TwoXChromosomes X No, not really. Sometimes I don't get full use of a tampon that way (can't get it back in because its floppy-ish), but my flow is usually unusually heavy so I have to change it a lot anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X Did you have problems with your period when you first started? I'm about to hit the six month mark in a week or so and have had my period non stop for close to 5 of those 6 months.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I take Yasmin and skip the placebo pills (the last week of different colored pills from the rest). Taking it this way has allowed me to completely skip my period for months.  Interesting. Have any idea why it works that way?
TwoXChromosomes X I skip mine typically, so there is no "week" waiting period, it sometimes takes almost 2 weeks to start for me, well over a week i know for sure..  I take mine out right before i want to start my period, and put the new ring in on the sunday of when i start. Just for my own records.  the website says that its ok to have it in during your period, if you are concerned.
TwoXChromosomes X That issue is kind of beside the point in this case, since this is an article about communities abandoning female genital mutilation.  But I agree that male genital mutilation is generally more accepted and is also terrible.
TwoXChromosomes X Almost all anti-convulsants will interact with estrogen based birth controls, Topamax included. From the Topamax website:  &gt;Birth control pills. TOPAMAX may make your birth control pills less effective. Tell your healthcare professional if your menstrual bleeding changes while you are taking birth control pills and TOPAMAX.   There are very few that don't do this, oddly. 
TwoXChromosomes X Sigh. I am also part of that 70% of women who can only orgasm from clitoral stimulation, not sex. But that being said, I still find orgasms much more pleasurable at the hands of my man. I get off every time we have sex, but it always involves some sort of other stimulation. If you're convinced you're better at getting yourself off than he is, you should change that. In my experience, men jump at the chance to learn about how to get a woman off, so take some time to teach him, show him, and integrate some of what he's learned into actual sex. Adding penetration to the mix makes orgasms INFINITELY better, imo.
BabyBumps X I hadn't know that it doesn't count until you hit the 4 cm... I think you work hard for every one of those cms and you should get credit for them :P I know with my delivery I was in labor for somewhere around 34 hours; however yours seems much more stressful and intense. I know when I finished pushing and our son was born I asked my husband how many hours I can claim to hold over his head for later in life lol :)
TwoXChromosomes X I've done it. Make sure you're on a monophasic pill (same amount of medication in each pill) and you can go right into the new pack. There's a small possibility that you will have spotting or light bleeding if you skip the placebo pills, but that doesn't usually happen.   If you're on a triphasic pill (like TriCyclen, with three different levels of hormones in the active pills), then I've heard it's still possible to skip periods, but there are different rules - something involving taking the pills in reverse order, I think? Check with your doctor on this though - I've never used a triphasic pill so I don't really know. 
TwoXChromosomes X The only thing I'd add is that women who have never given birth tend to "expel" IUDs at a relatively high rate - about 10%, if memory serves. It's not dangerous or anything, but you obviously won't be protected if you expel it. 
TwoXChromosomes X So there are a FEW newer pills out there that don't have placebos. Yasmin does in fact have placebo pills so it is fine for CajunQueen to skip them. However, there are some newer ones on the market that have fewer placebo pills (2-4 instead of 7), and some that just have lower hormones that week. The lower dose of hormones allows a woman to get her period yet it is enough to minimize symptoms such as headaches and cramping. I don't know what eva2222 takes, but she may be on one of those. There are also some brands that have placebos that do not contain hormones, but do contain iron. Regardless of the brand, as long as you start the new pack as soon as you're supposed to and take the pill exactly as prescribed you should be good to go.  Sources: -control-pill/WO00098 -control  
TwoXChromosomes X Your post is somewhat confusing, did the guy actually pull out? did they use any form of birth control?  Assuming the guy only pulled out and no birth control was used, it would be a good idea to get plan b as soon as possible.  Some studies have shown effectiveness of pulling out but many people aren't perfect with it and there's always a risk of pregnancy.  It can be difficult to know when she ovulates even if she is tracking it well, but regardless of expected ovulation, I'd still suggest plan b if pulling out was the only type of contraception. 
TwoXChromosomes X No, you need to treat UTI's. If you don't, the infection will spread to the kidney's and she could actually lose a kidney if it's bad enough. Go to urgent care at the very least and get the necessary antibiotics.   Also, buy some cranberry juice!
Parenting X Golly, that would have been awesome to me.  My company does abide by FMLA so I could've taken more time, but couldn't afford to be paid less (short term disability) or not at all. So I took my two weeks vacation and was back to work. I was actually happy to get out of the house... but that's just me.  I'm sorry to say that there probably isn't much you can do.
TwoXChromosomes X She can take pyridium (over the counter) to help relieve the pain, also d-mannose with cranberry (sold in vitamin stores). These will only help mask pain and relieve the pressure to urinate as frequently though - she really should see a doctor. Take it from someone who has regular UTIs, the only way she will get better is with proper antibiotics. Go to the doctor now.
TwoXChromosomes X amox, won;t knock out a uti, she needs to go to the hospital, i am prone to uti's and ignoring them wil turn into a very painful bladder infection or even a kidney infection. blood in her urine is a sign that it has progressed to the kidneys, or will soon, don't chance it with your lady bits. its negligent of you to not take her to the er.
TwoXChromosomes X My sister developed Pre-E and HELLP rapidly (5pm Sunday Midwife appointment everything was fine; 1am she felt like she was dying).  She had planned a home-birth but went straight to the hospital when she realised something was terribly wrong.   However, the birth was still important.  She remained in control of decisions.  Her midwife still attended even though care had been transferred to the hospital.  The OB respected her wish to use as little intervention as necessary.  She was monitored closely, but allowed to birth vaginally.  Every birth is different, and there are absolutely different levels of emergency. Do not imply that I don't care about the well-being of my children because I choose to homebirth.  I did my research and it's what I was comfortable with.  I'm close to hospitals, I had a team of qualified midwives and when I started to hemorrhage they dealt with it, and if it looked like what they had in their arsenal wasn't going to work, I would have been on my way to the hospital.
TwoXChromosomes X All birth control options require personal experimentation if you're looking for the perfect one. The pill isn't your only option and from your concerns, it sounds like something you don't want. All birth control pills involve hormones and many women do experience side effects like more or less acne. Some do experience weight gain, but not all. Because you have a history of depression, the pill might also not be the right solution for you.  You can get a copper IUD, which does not use hormones to prevent pregnancy. However, it can give you heavy periods and some women experience worse cramps (some! not all!). Alternatively, you could try the Mirena IUD, which *does* have hormones, but in smaller doses so side effects tend to be milder and rarer. It can cause periods to completely disappear in some women, though spotting is common for the first month. The [diaphragm]( -topics/birth-control/diaphragm-4244.htm) is a non-hormonal method of birth control. It has a slightly higher failure rate, though, and takes some getting used to. There's also [FemCap]( -topics/birth-control/cervical-cap-20487.htm), another non-hormonal birth control device.  I have used 2 different birth control pills. One made me a moody, crazy person who cried every night and I gained 7 lbs. Once I switched to my new one, I lost 10 lbs and no longer have random bouts of crying. The thing is, every pill affects everyone differently. If you're dead set on finding a pill that works for you, you'll have to prepare yourself for some nasty side effects and investing some time into it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Not really. There are different degrees of FGM - check out WHO's definitions. Not all FGM is created equal; some is just ceremonial slicing up of the labia. Check out [procedures]( ).  Typically people are not comparing FGM and male circumcision on the axis of severity, but on the axis of injustice. That is why the analogy does not bother me. It is unjust to cut up the genitals of any child, because it violates their human rights, namely bodily sovereignty.  And, just to nitpick, because I *hate* male circumcision sympathizing just because it's part of our culture:  &gt;Or maybe if it is done by people with no medical training, with unsterile instruments. Or if it is done at an age where they are fully aware of what is going on and no anaethetic is ever used.   This is sometimes the case. [Muslim]( _%28circumcision%29#Time_for_circumcision) boys are often circumcised as six or seven-year-olds or up to puberty, sometimes fully awake. The circumciser is usually a doctor of some kind, though not always. These practices are changing, but so are the practices of FGM. 
TwoXChromosomes X I wonder if your period will continue to be normal like that? The same thing happened to me, and then I got it again two weeks later, and then again two weeks later, then not for a month and a half, then twice in a month, and now it's regular. 6 months later, its finally normal. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you want to enrage yourself even more check out the "Personhood movement". They believe that anything that could possibly cause a fertilized egg not to implant is abortion and want to outlaw it all. That would include ALL hormonal BC, IUDs, as well as the morning after pill. 
BabyBumps X Thank you. I'm only 6 weeks. I know a lot can happen and we're still early on. We haven't told many people about this, but because I'm so panicking over it (and my husband is on cloud 9), I have no one to really vent to. Everytime my husband doesn't see me as excited as him, he unintentionally makes me feel bad and says things like "if you can't be excited now, when will you be?". I'm just in such shock of HOW can I do this? I'm so scared!
BabyBumps X If you are taking prenatal vits you should be fine. Try not to worry stressing out will not help anything.:) If your doc isn't worried then you should not be either. Gaining weight when pregnant depends on how much you weighed before pregnancy(overweight-underweight). Congrats on the little one.
TwoXChromosomes X You seem to be limiting sex to intercourse. It's not a matter of being subtle, it's a matter of talking about something rather different than the rest of us are talking about.  Sex is more than just fucking. There are times when one partner will give physical pleasure to the other partner, and derive no physical pleasure themselves; but still find it pleasing.  &gt;Truly great oral performances are done when the giver it is enjoying it as much as the receiver. That is much less likely to occur when the man comes first.  Well, I guess gay guys are fucked, aren't they?  If we're talking about a hetero relationship, and the man can't give good oral after he comes - well, he needs to learn, or he needs to come second. Or they need to find other methods of pleasure. Or whatever they find works for them.
TwoXChromosomes X everyone is different? and also people's periods change throughout their lives. i used to throw up from the pain when i was younger and have week long periods, then from ages 18-21 my periods were pretty normal and lasted only four days. just because you and your coworkers don't experience it doesn't mean *no woman on the face of this earth* could possibly ever have a really painful, debilitating menstrual cycle 
TwoXChromosomes X Well, many people don't want kids RIGHT NOW but might want them in the future.  Some kinds of hormonal contraception have worse side effects than others.  Many people switch around until they find one that works best with their body type.  For instance, I don't want kids today but I will want kids in several years.  I take an oral contraceptive because I experience few bad side effects and have no desire to switch.  If for some reason, I experienced some of the tell-tale symptoms of pregnancy... I would freak out! And if I experienced them every month (which some women do), I would freak out 12x a year... Even with oral BC and condom use, it is difficult to be 100% because paranoia and fear set in.
TwoXChromosomes X [25% of women have period pain so bad that it can be categorized as dysmenorrhoea, or pain during menstruation that is so bad that it interferes with daily activities.]( )
TwoXChromosomes X I think physical therapy is the best treatment for this, and should be tried before more serious interventions (that have side-effects or risks). #typical  I have mild vulvodynia (provoked vestibulodynia) and severe vaginismus, and am using tons of pelvic floor physiotherapy techniques to combat it.
TwoXChromosomes X They need to tell their doctor if it hurts, because it can indicate a problem. They also need to tell their doctor if sex hurts. Most causes of sexual pain can be fixed, and all can be treated.
TwoXChromosomes X The brown pills are placebos/sugar pills just so you remember to take a pill at the same time every day. They don't do anything as far as helping the actual pills.      Not that anecdotes are science, but I never take my colored pills (I'm on some other named BCP) and have never had a scare. 
TwoXChromosomes X Well I went from trying to have a baby from October of last year to about February this year, to stopping the process until September or so. I conceived in May. So while I did desperately want a baby, it was a bit sooner than I was prepared for!  My poor SO got the call at work from me after I took three tests that came up positive. I was bawling hysterically and totally afraid. I had just been warned by my doctor not to get pregnant until my thyroid was under control, otherwise I would probably miscarry. :c   So far so good though. I hope I get a baby out of this. Thank you!
TwoXChromosomes X Your vagina is a muscle, so yeah, if it's not being stretched regularly, it's going to contract back to it's 'default' size (or at least that's been my experience). I can't tell if you're already using lube when you have sex with him, but if not, start. Even if you think you're already super turned on, more lube helps. Second, consider getting a larger vibrator or using your fingers more when you get off, especially the two weeks before you see your bf, and see if that helps. r/sex might also have some good suggestions.
TwoXChromosomes X My BC actually made my cramps much less painful. I do still have to take pain medication, but my cramps are no where near as debilitating as they used to be. The downside of BC is that it's made me MUCH more emotional and mopey. 
Parenting X My son was given this in the NICU (he was about 6 weeks early) and I was shocked when we were sent home and told to get these. I bought it and gave it to him for a few days and then said WTH does a baby need this for??? I have not given it to him since, and he is 3 months old now, exceeding all his milestones and is a very happy/content baby.
TwoXChromosomes X I have the Paragard (non-hormonal) IUD and I love it. I don't do well with hormones. so this was the best choice for me. I'm on year 10, so I'll be getting it taken out soon. Insertion was a little bit painful, and sometimes I get weird twinges, but other than that it's been great.
TwoXChromosomes X I really love my Paragard :) I get a normal, natural cycle now, plus I don't have to worry about having babies until 2023 if I want. Yeah, my period is a little heavy and cramps suck, but the positive outweighs the negative, and hormones are terrible for me. 
TwoXChromosomes X It is very common, indeed, for women to not have orgasms during sex however when it does happen - it is magic. The advice I offer is to concentrate. When you feel like you could climax from something he is doing while inside of you, focus on it and vocally or physically tell him to continue. As long as your mind and body are in sync, I believe you can achieve the greatness of orgasm! I hope it helps, love!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm taking brand Yasmin (no generic here yet), and I can skip one row of white pills, but if I try more than one, I'll start spotting during the third pack. I could probably get my body used to it, but I can't be bothered. However, since my iron is a bit on the low side (because of heavy bleeding, which is why I started Yasmin in the first place), I always skip every other row of white pills, leading to six weeks on, one week off instead of three weeks on, one off. It works very well for me, has for three years now :)
TwoXChromosomes X The infection is probably resistant and you'll need to switch antibiotics.    Make sure you're drinking pure/normal cranberry juice and not that sugar water made from concentrate.    
TwoXChromosomes X I want to try Seventh Generation, but I've read online reviews that say they're not very absorbent... My period is pretty heavy the first 2 days. So IDK. I think I should probably be using chlorine-free, unscented pads, though, my skin is pretty sensitive
TwoXChromosomes X Like others have said,  try an electric heating pad when you're at home.  Crank that baby up to max and lay it across your tummy.  They work really well.  You can also take a hot water bottle to bed with you in the evenings.  If you need to be out and about,  try some menstrual [heat patches (like these)]( ).  They're like wireless heating pads you can stick in your panties!  They are a bit pricey,  but they work very well and last for quite some time,  and it's worth it to get your life back for those few days.  Generic Midol + heat patches carry me through the worst of my menstrual woes.
TwoXChromosomes X Did you get a second opinion at all?? I was told I couldn't have kids. My pregnancy was rough. And my son almost died during birth. then I almost died a week after he was born. But he was worth all that. He's 8 months now. Reading this made me appreciate my little dude even more. Be strong.
TwoXChromosomes X No the ring wont have absorbed the antibiotics (they are absorbed into your blood, the ring is in your vagina?), and as far as I'm aware (have looked it up too) there are no known drug reactions between progesterone and antibacterials - so your period wont have started early *because* of the antibacterials.  Have you been using it back to back, or taking it out monthly?
TwoXChromosomes X If I aborted the live force inside of me I would be a little :/   I would have been a baby. I support abortion not that I ever want to get one.....
BabyBumps X The cramping is totally normal.  I remember cramping so bad at the start that I was sure I was having an early miscarriage.  I was even worried about ectopic pregnancy or some such, it was that bad.  But, it was apparently normal, along with some early bleeding around 8 weeks.  I'm 31 weeks now and he's healthy as can be. :)
TwoXChromosomes X It's a silicone cup which is not absorbent. You can wear it for 12 hours at a time, and then just take it out and dump the contents, wash and re-insert. It's $30 but it lasts for 5 years, so it saves money. It's reusable, so it reduces waste too. It's just about the best thing I've ever bought, definitely the best thing I've ever done for my hoo hoo :)  You can read more [here]( ). 
TwoXChromosomes X If a doctor had explained that they didn't want to put an IUD (or another form of birth control) in due to my uterus not being large enough (from not having kids) and this would effect it's ability to work properly, I would be fine with this. And we would then discuss another method. But unfortunately, that's rarely the way it's presented.   
TwoXChromosomes X I was told "I won't insert an IUD in a woman without kids because in rare cases IUDs cause infertility".  When I said I never wanted kids and was considering sterilization she just said no and wrote me a script for a different kind of pills.  She said if I was still having side effects from the pills we could discuss an IUD after I had tried the pills for several months.    For what its worth I'm in my late 20s and have several friends who have IUDs and no children.  I'm not buying "it just doesn't work for women who haven't been pregnant".
TwoXChromosomes X Cranberries *do not fucking work*.  I tried them, many times, in the following forms.  Both preventatively and to try and clear up mild early infections:   - dried cranberries  - cranberry drink  - unsweetened cranberry juice  - raw cranberries  - liquid cranberry extract  - cranberry pills  - cranberry capsules  They do not fucking work.  Antibiotics work, except you can get sucked into a cycle of recurrent UTIs (perhaps because your own immune system isn't having to work?)  But if you try to fight a UTI without antibiotics, you risk losing a kidney.  Recurrent cystitis is a truly fucking awful condition.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think you should have sex unless you are prepared for the consequences of sex.  One of the potential consequences is pregnancy.  I absolutely plan on sex education, and plenty of it, but I don't agree with abortion.  I certainly wouldn't disown my daughter if she had one, and I would support her right to make her own decision, but I wouldn't approve, either.  I think we can all agree that most teens aren't physically, emotionally, mentally, or socially ready to be parents.  Therefore, I would strongly encourage her to find non-vaginal-intercourse ways to have sexual fun until at least 17.  That's my position, at the moment (she's only a year).  Her father may feel differently.
TwoXChromosomes X I use Yazmine and it practically ended my acne problem. As for the side effects, I've asked two GYNs about Yazmine, and it has the same risks for blood clots and other side effects as other similar hormonal birth control. According to these doctors, the reason it brought on more lawsuits was that it advertised too much on television (and probably was not honest about the potential side effects).   Now, I don't know if going on birth control just for acne is the best way to go. There are other ways of treating the problem.
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm. I took a CVS brand test and it came up as positive for me. I think it was about 2 days after implantation.  Just go to a drug store and look at the early detection tests and see what the box says.   Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm guessing you are using M1 vs. M7?  If so: 1-DAY (tioconazole 6.5%)** from the makers of MONISTAT  Keeps on working for days even after one dose to provide an effective cure  Includes 1 ready-to-use prefilled applicator  It's important to understand that all yeast infections may take up to 7 days to cure completely. While MONISTAT 1 Combination Pack (miconazole nitrate) and 1-DAY (tioconazole 6.5%) offer the most convenient yeast infection treatment course, most women do not experience a cure of the infection in just one day. If you do not feel some relief within 3 days, or complete relief within 7 days, stop using the product and consult your doctor. 
TwoXChromosomes X Personally I would use a long-acting birth control method if I was in this situation. The Mirena (Intra Uterine System), the implant (Implanon) or the Depo Provera injection. If you have to avoid hormones, I would go for the ParaGard copper IUD.
TwoXChromosomes X If you were just taking antibiotics the week before the probability of it being BV is extremely low (they treat BV *with* antibiotics) whereas the probability of it being a yeast infection is rather high (antibiotics remove the good bacteria that help balance yeast levels - hence yeast gets out of control).  Of course, if it's your first time having a yeast infection it can be weird and scary and all-round unfortunate and a trip to your doctor would certainly help with easing your concerns, but I doubt you need to rush out to the ER or anything to get it checked on.  Don't get yourself too worked up, it happens to everyone at some point. :) Oh, and for the future, a lot of people find the one-day Monistat treatments to be way too intense - try a three or five day course next time. It takes a little longer but is much gentler (always good on the lady bits) and you'll feel the relief instead of the fun-time burn you can get with one-day supercures.
TwoXChromosomes X The body of a being that is non-sentient and unable to live on its own, but has the potential to. If you care that much about potential humans then you are a murderer for recycling your sperm.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, I did.  &gt;Up until the point where it's so progressed that the fetus could reasonably survive outside the womb without overly drastic medical intervention, **yes**.  And then said anything after that line would have to be health of the mother (specifically health, not just life, because there are other severe but non-fatal complications), or in case of severe defect of the fetus. It's nearly impossible to not know you're pregnant before that line, except in case of lots of denial and ignorance. There is some responsibility on the woman to be aware of herself.
TwoXChromosomes X Unless something has changed since then, the Fetal Heartbeat Bill passed. Abortion is now prohibited in Ohio after 6 weeks, or when you can first detect a fetus' heartbeat.
TwoXChromosomes X I think what is important to emphasize here is the major health risks involved with pregnancy- It's not just morning sickness and lack of energy, the possibility of dying and the complications that arise from both a vagina delivery and c-section are very real dangers associated with pregnancy.  These dangers are still associated with giving birth, even in the developed world and should not be discounted merely as an "inconvenience" for the mother.
TwoXChromosomes X Truth depends entirely upon your point of view. That same clump of cells that you say is a person could develop into a child with no lungs, no brain, no heart. It could make the mother bleed to death with its birth. It could have any one of the thousands of deformities that would give it a short, painful life. The mother, on the other hand, is a rational human being. Until the time comes when women can transfer the child out of their uterus and into a faux-womb to incubate, it is entirely her decision. 
TwoXChromosomes X Okies - here they are:  &gt;I would also extend the question of when you think life begins. If you think it begins at conception, should women who miscarry be charged with murder or negligent homicide? Infanticide? If it does not, at what point does it appear? Is it a matter of viability?  &gt;Do you truly think that a clump of cells - charged with potential as they may be - actually want anything? That they regret things? How do you come to this conclusion?
Parenting X &gt;Today I found out that my work isn't going to pay my wife for her leave of absence after she has our daughter.   I was going to ask why this was, but then I wiki'd it.  "[**The United States is the only Western country that does not mandate paid parental leave**, although the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) mandates up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave, including parental leave, for many American workers. American employers, however, are not mandated under FMLA to pay their workers during a leave covered by this law.]( _leave)"  Wow.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, the Mirena is just plastic and secretes hormones into the uterus. No copper.
TwoXChromosomes X I had ovarian cysts as a child so from 11 to about 16 years old. I took BC beginning at 14 to control them. It created more but they weren't painful like the others. Eventually I just outgrew them. However while I had them I had to keep a very mild pain killer on me at all times pretty much until I started bc to keep them at bay.   They usually hurt around periods and ovulation.   Good luck. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X Every other month it would get absolutely terrible. I have since gone on hormonal birth control and it has leveled it out quite a bit though some months are still a little painful. For the most part I have stopped getting the so-painful-I-puke-and-faint cramps though.  Definitely talk to your doctor though, they should be able to help.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I've left mine in from sunrise to sunset before. No problem. The only time I had to change it in a public restroom was due to a particularly heavy flow. I just dumped it and shoved 'er back in. It just gets dirty again anyway. I just make sure to wash it really well at night and in the morning. Although now I've got an IUD and feel more comfortable with tampons and pads :(
BabyBumps X In the US, a certified nurse midwife is a certified nurse that has taken graduate coursework regarding childbirth. I specifically wanted to go with a midwife practice because I wanted the least amount of interventions as possible, but they work closely with the local hospital in case I need to be transferred there during labor (the midwife will still be "in charge" at the hospital, unless something like an epidural or c-section is necessary).  I would really suggest that you at least look into midwife practices. They are women- and child-centered and professional midwives will not try to force anything on you that you don't want. Good luck!
BabyBumps X I am a first time mom at 36 weeks, am planing a home birth, and have taken the class... I can tell you right now, the class was so awesome and has had so many benefits so far, I don't even *care* if I have a pain-free natural birth (though I have used the techniques for the discomfort of perennial massage and blood draws, and it has worked well for both of those). I highly recommend you take it, if only for the very thorough education on pregnancy and birth and the amazing stress relief you get from your daily self-hypnosis practice. It's also great to be so close to delivery and not feel an *ounce* of fear or apprehension! They really do concentrate on getting you 100% prepared for birth, and I can really appreciate that.  Edit: Before signing up, I asked five local moms who took the class how their labors went... only one said she had any discomfort, but she was also the only one who was induced so that might have had something to do with it.  Edit 2: I am also a skeptic, by nature. But whenever I'm feeling skeptical, I can really feel a drop in the efficacy of the techniques (during my daily perineal massage). I can regain my ability to significantly reduce the pain by looking at it as learning how to let go and accept that my body can handle anything, rather than looking at it as a mind/body power game. There are some suggestions in the Hypnobabies material that lean a bit too much toward "mind over matter" for me, but there are also suggestions throughout the Hypnobabies material that you can leave out anything in the program that doesn't work for you. So, I left that part out, and I concentrate on what I can feel is really working for me, which is learning to relax in order to let my body do it's thing. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just found the TwoXChromosomes subreddit, so I don't know much about past posters, but I just got my copper IUD three weeks ago, and it's been a complete godsend.  I love it.  People who have trouble with birth control meds (like me) won't have the same negative effects with the IUD.  It does seem expensive, running about $600 for the copper and $800 for the Merina, but just check with your healthcare provider.  Mine covered 80% and made the IUD a cheaper option than normal birth control pills in the long run.  The copper lasts for 10 years...so not too shabby.  
TwoXChromosomes X i get UTI's a lot (even had a CT scan once, because they were so frequent) but i've never ever had a doctor tell me it had anything to do with shaving. either way, there are ways to help prevent UTI's, and Viorya is right with peeing after sex, and cranberry pills (or juice!). also never "hold it" when you gotta go, that can cause them as well. showering after you've peed after sex is also a good idea, and wiping 'correctly' is something to think about... but really, many women shave and effectively prevent UTI's.
TwoXChromosomes X It's just your body adjusting to the hormones. It'll take a few months for everything to get straightened out. Three months ago I switched from the pill to the nuvaring, not expecting too much change since they're similar hormones. Instead, Month 1: lightest, easiest period I've ever had. Month 2: most painful, crampy period I've ever had. Month 3: totally normal. Give your body some time to figure it all out. It'll be worth it in the end to not have to worry about condoms or taking a pill every day.
TwoXChromosomes X Hey there - I got implanoin inserted over a year and a half ago. One thing to warn you about is that everyone has different reactions to everything - some do very well, some do very badly. Me, i'm one of the lucky ones.  Painless, quick easy insertion as described above. Absolutely no side affects since - NONE. Best of all - I don't get a period at all any more, I don't have to deal with the pain/mess monthly. It really has been perfect for me; I highly reccomend it.
TwoXChromosomes X I would avoid masterbation as it will get yeast on your hands and toys - which can be transferred to your mouth and nose.  Go buy the yeast infection test to be sure.  Get some anti itch cream - you can even use plain yogurt to help alleviate the itch - it feels so cool and creamy...if the test comes positive get the creams and take care of it.  I'm open for natural remedies, though masterbation is not one of them - but i've yet to encounter a natural remedy that is effective AND quick.  FYI - itching is the trademark of yeast infections - that and burning.
TwoXChromosomes X I do take midol as soon as I start seeing signs of period coming up, but it barely dulls the pain, enough so that I can get through the day, but I'm still miserable and can't eat for like the first two days.
Parenting X I think a lost ~95% of it in the first 2 weeks now I'm down below pre-pregnancy weight.  I think it's only because I didn't exercise through the whole pregnancy and lost a fair amount of muscle mass, so now i'm the same size but weaker and weigh less.  I only gained 17lbs though so it all kind of fell off through breastfeeding and walks outside when I got bored.  I haven't gotten back into rebuilding my strength yet (been 4.5 months).
TwoXChromosomes X Is it supposed to come 28 days after the first day of the last period? Or 28 days after the last day of the last period? Slightly off topic but now I'm trying to figure out if I'll have mine during vacation!
TwoXChromosomes X It was hard at first, getting them in and out. But you get used to it after one period or two. After that there's exactly no downside. No discomfort WHATSOEVER, no more waste, no gross smell,  no more buying tampons/pads, no health risk if you forget to take it out for a day or two (unlike tampons,) they pay for themselves. Pop it in and forget your troubles!
Parenting X Most kids learn their first words around 12 months, but they can't ask for the breast at that point (unless you count trying to lift up your shirt).  Most kids can't say two word phrases until 24 months old.  He won't say, "Mommy, milk," at 12 months old, if that's what your husband is worried about.  My son is 21 months old, and he still doesn't say, "milk."    Anyway, my son nursed until he was 16 months old.  My goal was 12 months, like yours.  Unfortunately, he wasn't ready to wean at 12 months.  He still wanted to nurse every 2-3 hours during the day at that age (except at night.  I stopped nursing him at night around 11 months old).    There was never a good age to wean my son.  He was still nursing twice a day at 16 months when I stopped nursing him completely.  He wanted to nurse *all* the time.  I had to tell him no throughout the day, but twice a day I would say yes.  Finally, I decided that was more confusing for him than if I just finally said no.  I stopped nursing him one day.  He handled it well, and before a know it, a week went by, and it seemed that nursing never crossed his mind after that.  He didn't try to lift my shirt or anything.  It wasn't "weaning" as much as it was "cold turkey," but nothing else would work for him.
Parenting X Most moms who continue to breastfeed past 1 year are able to cut out the pumping while they're away and just breastfeed while they're together.    Breastfeeding after my son's first birthday was far more enjoyable than the first year.  There was less pressure about quantity, I didn't have to worry about pumping, and my supply was so established that I didn't leak and it took a lot for me to feel engorged, but I still had plenty for him.
TwoXChromosomes X I own a diva cup and I also wear pads.  I do not wear tampons. I use the extra long variety (regular, super, or overnight) with wings.  At one point, stayfree made extra long overnight winged pads with wings at the butt part too that were pretty awesome.  This also might be tmi, but I also kinda tuck/fold hold the butt end with my crack (why isn't there a better term for it) - but sometimes this doesn't work quite the way I'd like it to.  I also sleep with a hand in between my legs which kinda helps hold everything in place.... 
BabyBumps X There are so many. Some popular ones include Lamaze (though I've been told they're not as thorough as others, focus is on breathing techniques.), Bradley (kind of outdated, but still relevant, focuses on husband coached labor, or labor with a coach of some kind), Brio which is very new and a spinoff on Bradley, Birthing from Within, Hypnobabies, Hypnobirthing (not sure of the differences, but both of these prepare you to use meditation/deep relaxation as a coping technique) That's all I can think of off the top of my head. There are also doulas and childbirth educators who will give classes not affiliated with any of these. If you go with this just make sure you ask lots of questions and get some references.  I would highly recommend Brio if you have a teacher in your area. They cover EVERYTHING and they are very neutral so you don't just learn one type of coping technique. They use very up to date research too, which some others don't. That's why they broke off from Bradley. There's more info on the website. This is the organization I will be going with when I train.  Your hospital will offer a childbirth education class most likely. It will probably only be a few hours long. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It is not there to prepare you for natural birth, it is there to prepare you for that hospitals birth.  Make sure it is 8-12 weeks long. And if your husband is available to go that's great, some classes will require it.  This is kind of rambly and scattered, but I think it's all there... If I think of anything else I'll shoot you a message :)
TwoXChromosomes X The article's perspective is all well and good unless your sex partner uses this as an excuse to avoid even trying to get you there.  Personally, I aim for an amazing orgasm for me and my husband every time. We don't stress if it doesn't work in that session or we have a bit of a dud, we make up for it in the raincheck session :) Neither of us have problems orgasming generally.  We aim for orgasms, but we still enjoy the journey towards them :)
TwoXChromosomes X I was diagnosed with a vascular autoimmune disease that my doc thinks was probably triggered by the birth control I was taking (Trinessa)
Parenting X my first son had complications and I ended up with an emergency c section. My hospital doesn't do VBAC, and with the type of complications I had, I probably wouldn't have tried it anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't know the scientific reasons, but some bodies just work better with different doses. All bodies are different. A woman could take a pill with 30 mg of estrogen and have it give her awful cramps and migraines, while a pill with only 20 mg doesn't affect her. It has a lot to do with body chemistry, I think. It sucks, but you have to experiment. Then again, some women don't get any side effects whatsoever.  Besides remembering to take it everyday, I love the pill. I love that I don't have to worry about weird side effects varying degrees of PMS and whatnot. If you're that concerned about side effects, as I am, because I'm sensitive to EVERYTHING, I'd ask you doc for something with a low dose of estrogen, like Loestrin or Microgestin.
TwoXChromosomes X The nuvaring can be used safely for up to 4 weeks (talk to your doctor, always). Just be warned that your period may still come the first time you try and skip a period, depending on how your body responds to the hormones. Talk to your doctor about your options, though. 
TwoXChromosomes X I skipped my period on the Nuvaring and I didn't have any of the effects I normally would when I get my period. Since you're not taking the hormones out of your body like you normally would, your body doesn't really recognize that its 'period time'. I think you should be okay if you skip it. Its still effective for those full 4 weeks, just don't go any longer then that without putting in a new ring. 
TwoXChromosomes X Ask for a pill that is suitable for skipping periods with. This means that the hormones in every single pill are the same, as opposed to ones who have different levels of hormones for different times of the month.
TwoXChromosomes X Buy yourself a heating pad if you don't already have one.  Also I had severe cramps for like 3 days after insertion.  I recommend Aleve.  Cramps during cycles aren't that bad though. 
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks so much for the info!  My MD discussed the irregular bleeding with me and I was okay with that since my period's already irregular.  It's the constant bleeding that I'm wary of...  Was it a continuous heavy bleed for 3mos?  Or off and on?  And did you have a stopping point for yourself if the bleeding didn't cease?  I *just* started on celexa, so I'm slightly worried about how implanon is going to mix with it in terms of any mood swings or libido changes.  I'm currently a few hours away from my guy so I'm it won't matter as much.
TwoXChromosomes X Withdrawl preg. rates: 27% with typical use, 4% with perfect  Condom preg rates: 15% with typical use, 2% with perfect.  When over 1/4 of the period with typical use results in pregnancy, arguing that it is a safe method for birth control is foolish -- this disregards STD protection.  You are, however, technically correct that with perfect use that it is more than 90% effective... 96% effective according to your source.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for a year and a half and for two days every period I can fill an Ultra Absorbancy tampon in an hour and a half. I don't cramp though. Fun times!
TwoXChromosomes X Periods are not bleeding.  It's the shedding of the uterine lining.  You are not wounded, so there is no reason you should die
TwoXChromosomes X Copper IUD (Paragard) user here and I love it :) I had to get off of hormones for the very reason you said - my libido was murderized. It took me a good 6-8 months to get it back, and it took a good 3 months at first for my IUD to settle in and my uterus to stop flipping the fuck out...but, for 12 years of (almost) worry-free and completely hormone-free contraception, it was all totally worth it.  If you're interested in the option, definitely ask your GP about it.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had my Paraguard for almost 2 years now, and I love it. I too cannot use birth control with hormones as I developed a blood clot from the pill. The doctor would not even prescribe the Mirena IUD for me.   Insertion was horrible. It was terribly painful (beyond what I could have imagined), and I threw up after it was inserted. Insertion, however, is not as painful for everybody. Plan on taking a day off, and have someone pick you up from your appointment.   At first, I had severe cramping when on my period and heavy bleeding (but my periods had always been particularly heavy). Now, almost two years later, my periods are actually much lighter compared to what they were (even before the Paraguard) and my cramping has subsided considerably. This all took about a year to even out.   With my insurance, I paid $100. for my Paraguard, however, it's so much cheaper in the long run. 
TwoXChromosomes X I didn't when I was on the pill, and I wouldn't if I had an IUD. It actually rather bothers me how paranoid some people can be about birth control. *So* many couples use only condoms to prevent pregnancy--and it works, or it does 98% of the time when you're not being stupid. The pill was *made* to be used as a sole form of birth control: I'm totally fine with using just the pill as long as I haven't missed a day; using both the pill and a condom makes it .005% more effective (i.e., I don't care). And this is certainly true of IUDs, which are super-effective with no doses to be skipped.   I can definitely understand being paranoid and wanting to double-up *just in case*, but the chances are so slim that I think it's a waste of time, effort, and pleasure. Far be it for me to tell people what their comfort levels should be--use two methods if that's what makes you happy! and one should certainly avoid the other extreme of 'herp derp withdrawal is perfect birth control'. Despite my strong anti-baby desires, though, I try to be reasonable and not too paranoid in my birth control needs.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never been pregnant and got the mirena IUD 3years ago.  I love mine!! Insertion was a cinch and this has been the best, cheapest, most hassle free birth control I have ever used.  
TwoXChromosomes X Also, I would bet that a lot of people will say that they intended to get pregnant even if they really didn't, so that people will not think of it as an accident or a mistake. I know a few people who have gotten pregnant accidentally and have privately told me it was "a happy accident", but happily told everyone else it was planned.
TwoXChromosomes X True.  I think the most important part of giving women access to birth control is that it's cheaper than society paying for unwanted babies.
TwoXChromosomes X Thats just what doctors advise. You are less likely to get a bladder infection if you pee before and after sex. The point is you don't want a full bladder around sexual activities because it makes it much easier to then get a UTI. The peeing after also helps with cleaning away any bacteria that might cause a UTI.
TwoXChromosomes X #1-Take out your cup twice a a day. Wake up? Take it out, empty it, and wash it.  Going to sleep? Take it out, empty it, and wash it.  #2-Boil your cup before the start of your cycle and at the end of your cycle for at least 20 minutes to sanitize it.  I used Instead cups for a brief time before using my cup.  For me there was a much greater learning curve for my Diva Cup than Insteads.  My Diva Cup was a real bitch to get in  place at first, but we have worked out our differences now.  Instead cups seemed to work with my body more easily so insertion was easy.  
TwoXChromosomes X My SO thinks it's pretty cool, too! My vagina used to feel raw at the end of my period from using tampons so the first sexytime after was always a little painful. I just thought everyone had to deal with that. But, sex-pain no more! The silicone is so gentle and soft and nice! Plus if we have sexy showers while I'm on my period there's no string hanging down. I originally bought it for the environmental benefits, but there's so many other benefits! Softness! Not needing to stock your purse with supplies! Saving money! Comfy sex!
TwoXChromosomes X it took us 6 months, but it felt longer, my second miscarriage was in April and we waited until June to ttc again and then after that it took 6 months of trying, I got my + pregnancy test in January this year. When I look back it doesn't sound all that long but during those 6 months it felt like eternity. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;But I'm sure you've already heard that argument a million times, so no need to delve into it further.  Yes, and it has merit, to some extent.  If we could abort in the first two weeks of pregnancy, I don't think I'd have a problem with that.  I have no problem with Plan B.  I do think it's a separate organism from the beginning, well before it can live outside the womb; "separate" is not synonymous with "independent."  It's definitely not just another organ of the mother's, like the liver or spleen, as I said, it has it's own unique human DNA, and a complete set of human chromosomes.  But it's obviously not conscious or sentient or self-aware or anything for some time.  But by the time the women even finds out she's pregnant, if it's not already, within a week or two, the fetus has a beating heart.  Another week or two and you've got a brain.  Sentient?  No.  Able to feel pain?  Maybe?  A person?  I'm not sure why it's less of a person than a premie baby in a NICU.  Even if we accept being able to live outside the womb as a good line for legal protection, that ability varies from situation to situation and fetus to fetus.  The earliest baby born that survived was born at [21 weeks 5 days]( _birth#Notable_preterm_births).  That's just past halfway, and well before the current viability threshold.  There's no way to know if a second trimester baby will live until we try.  But even if the baby can't live outside the womb-- we don't think people are less human for needing oxygen tanks to breathe or dialysis machines to clean their blood.  I understand the unique situation here-- the life support machine is another person, which changes things, but in terms of the legal protection status of the fetus, being unable to live independently, in and of itself, should not be a criterion.  There is single point in development where you can definitively say, now it's a baby, and certainly no hard threshold you can set for all fetuses everywhere.  I'd rather err on the side of not killing an innocent life.  I'm not really trying to convince you, btw, just give you food for thought.  &gt;But my way of thinking doesn't stop people who don't share my beliefs from doing what they want to do.  Sure it does-- it stops all the unborn fetuses from doing anything, ever.  Don't get me wrong, as I said before, I can see both sides, and I get your point.  I don't want to see women forced to bear children they don't want.  I don't want to see women cut up and infected by back alley butchers.  That's why I'm for full sex ed, accessible and affordable birth control and health care, and adoption reform (we've got TONS of people who want to raise unwanted kids).  But I don't think abortion is a valid choice, any more than it's a valid choice to stuff your hours-old newborn in a plastic bag and toss it in a dumpster.
TwoXChromosomes X Wasn't me.  "The only thing that I agree with on the pro-life side is that abortion ends a human life."  By pulling him or her off his or her life support system, the mother.  If a woman chooses to engage in sex with a man knowing that there is always a risk of a human life being created and that human created by her actions will need to consume her physical resources then she should take responsibility for her actions and not force the responsibility on the fetus/embryo that had no say in the matter.  The goriness of the pictures is irrelevant. Speech, whether you agree with it or not should be preserved as long as it doesn't harm public safety. The billboards and posters present images of dead humans in a very early stage of growth and development. They depict the reality of abortion, and try to help people see what it really is under the rhetoric of "women's choice."  Also, this may sound absurd and silly, but if men could get pregnant and have babies, I would be just as against them having abortions as well.
TwoXChromosomes X You're probably not dying at a faster rate than most people.  You could be having, an irregular period or just some spotting.  Also you may have miscalculated your period timing.  Maybe 2 weeks ago totally could be actually 3 weeks ago.  There are lots of reasons for spotting and most of them, as long as you feel otherwise fine, are pretty benign.  
TwoXChromosomes X Only about 25% of women are capable of achieving a vaginal orgasm and most of those have not figured it out.  I've done it maybe twice in 12 years of having sex.  Once for sure and another time could have been a really really good clitoral orgasm.  Otherwise, it's all about the clitoris.  I have more pleasure with vaginal stimulation in concert with clitoral stimulation but otherwise that is usually about it.  
TwoXChromosomes X What I've done before is inserted probiotic pearls directly, er, where the problem is -- and then did the monistat right after I finished the antibiotic.  If it's a recurring problem for you, sometimes you can get your doctor to prescribe an antifungal pill at the same time as the antibiotic.
Parenting X I never gave birth so it's not like I know what the pain feels like BUT here is what we are planning to do and why. We want to have a natural home birth. The reason why we picked a home birth is because we want to receive that child in a familiar and loving environment. I also feel like the best place to deal with pain is at home. We don't want to use any medication because we find that giving birth is a very natural process. Besides, even if I get pain medication, baby might also feel drugged but he will most likely still feel contractions pain. If he can do it, I can do it.  I think women have the choice nowadays to use or not medication...I don't think giving birth one way is better than another. I really think that the end result is what matters. What is important is that the couple knows what they want and that they remain realistic about what could happen.   If you want to learn more about natural and medicated birth in America, you can watch the movie "The business of being born." Before you watch it, know it's a movie that pushes a lot towards natural birth (biased). 
TwoXChromosomes X So sorry. I used to have terrible period pain too. I found motrin (US drug) was the only thing that worked. Since having kids curiously my period pains are much less, but I now have painful ovulations (WTF?!)  Also incidentally, when I went in to labor I dismissed the pains for ages as I couldn't believe they were labour - after all they were just like my regular period pains. When I got to the hospital I was 7 cms dilated. So don't let anyone belittle the pain you're dealing with - it is exactly like being in labour!
Parenting X I honestly think that the statistics about epidurals and c-sections are a bit biased. I think a lot of the reasons that women end up getting epidurals who weren't previously planning to are the same reasons that they end up with c-sections (as in something separate causes both, rather than one causing the other).
BabyBumps X I'm 33 with a 12 week old baby. I had a great pregnancy - just the regular complaints. Labor was good and painful and we got pregnant the first month.  I did gain weight though. I was 30lbs overweight and now I'm 70lbs!! But I was once 150lb overweight so I'm just glad I didn't regain all and hope I can lose it again.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had doctors recommend me to take (orally!) acidophilus capsules while taking antibiotics to prevent a yeast infection. I've never done it, but I have had multiple doctors and nurses recommend it.  Logically it seems it wouldn't be harmful to insert them directly if you have a yeast infection, since the acidophilus would help combat the yeast and return your bacteria levels to normal. However, I have no idea why you would use it solely to even out your pH without any other symptoms of an infection.
Parenting X I was in labor with #1 for 53 hours, and ended up with a c-section.  I have no qualms about eventually choosing pain medication, or about eventually needing a c-section. Edit: I had pre-e and didn't get pain meds until about 45 hours in. I could feel to push just fine. I was open to staying med free, but it wasn't the road I ended up on, and I am ok with that. There are plenty of people who got their superiority on about natural birth. Don't beat yourself up about it if you choose to go with pain meds. I've seen it go either way for many people.
TwoXChromosomes X The soft cup and insteads are both super lame. Difficult to insert and remove and does not get a good seal. They're too flexible perhaps. I don't know. If you are worried about the cost of the cup, think about how many disposables you will go through. Now think about the one time cost of the diva cup. I think iherb has a coupon, makes it under $30. 
TwoXChromosomes X You can find special acidophilus vaginal pessaries in pharmacies. I usually take something called Gyniel that you can either swallow or put in your vagina.
Parenting X Well, for a long time we were really trying as much as *not being careful.* Then as more time went on without an accidental pregnancy, I started to want one more and more. I got an ovulation calendar and started keeping track and this past month when I thought it was that time, we went at it like rabbits until we both walked like cowboys. We got lucky!
TwoXChromosomes X No, but I tend not to buy clothes online.  I usually look at clothes online, then go into the store to try them on and purchase them.   I shop almost exclusively from sale and clearance racks and have found that the prices in-store almost always beat the prices online.   
TwoXChromosomes X I used to masturbate like that all the time to the point where i couldn't cum from other stimulation.  coming from my own back ground and Dan Savages "death grip" advice i would say stop masturbating like that and then when you do get really horny to try to masturbate using other methods as long as it feels good you're doing it right.  even if you dont cum at first keep up with it and your body will get used to the new sensations and you will probably have a different feeling orgasm.  this little guy, while expensive is your friend: -premium/jimmyjane-form-2  If you live in a city with a babeland store i would suggest going in and talking to someone who works there they have always been super helpful and nice whenever i go in.  Also if you smoke pot, or are not opposed to it, you may want to smoke and masturbate it can really help you relax and makes things a bit more intense, or smoke with your SO and just have a good time with one another. I think the most important bit is though to just have fun and relax, remember that you are not on "Mission Orgasm" its more like "mission feel good and love yourself" (as cheesy as it sounds) good luck and have fun!
TwoXChromosomes X On depo I would bleed very very lightly for about three weeks leading up to my last shot.  Just a panty-liner's worth.  I got the IUD inserted right around the time I was scheduled to have my last shot, so I had  already bled for three weeks, and then it just got SUPER heavy.  After that it's been about 80% of the time heavy bleeding, and 20% light.  Very annoying.  Now I've been put on the pill for two months to balance my body out again.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Also not all women take birth contol just for preventing pregnancy  True, but I don't think this changes my argument.  Imagine a pill that is only birth control, doesn't treat any other condition.  Should it be free?  If you say "no" to this, then you won't say "yes" to birth control which also treats acne, since acne meds themselves aren't free. (of course if you answer yes to the former, you'll answer yes to the latter...)
TwoXChromosomes X Plus each option has different hormones and effects. One woman may take a pill with the same exact hormones as the ring, but the pill might make her vomit frequently. Since there is no generic option for the ring, why should this girl have to pay $110 a month instead of $10 for the same exact thing, just in plastic? The whole pharmaceutical system is just screwy.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;He was pretty much saying that we need to give all the guys boner-pills while not allowing the women to have any way to prevent unwanted pregnancy.  There are alternatives to hormonal birth control, so no, he isn't.  &gt;Yes, actually it is a part of this argument. You can't separate the two uses.  Yes you can separate the two uses. If, for example, the only reason that something is subsidized is because it allows you to have safe sex, then Viagra counts and hormonal birth control does not, because there are alternatives to hormonal birth control, and there aren't to Viagra.  I don't really feel like playing devil's advocate anymore though, because his side of the discussion is *so wrong*. It's just that this specific argument wasn't nearly as contradictory/stupid as you guys make it out to be.
TwoXChromosomes X Every time I've had to go on an antibiotic, I tell the doc that I'm really sensitive to getting yeast infections and they'll usually prescribe me some meds for that at the same time. Try it next time :)
TwoXChromosomes X Well, he was something like that size, four inches or maybe 3.5", when fully erect. That is starting to get to the statistically unusual sizes. Once you get to three inches or so, you are in the high end of the malformed range, so, as I said, "going on towards deformed," not actually so.  I also said wouldn't have really noticed much if he hadn't made a big deal of it. I don't know how big it was, exactly, just that it was small enough to make a couple of positions not practical, so small enough I noticed it was small. It also wasn't a deal-breaker by any means and I was perfectly okay with it, and it actually was better-suited to me than the one or two guys who went to the other extreme.
Parenting X We loved the Tommee Tippee sippy cups. They carry them at Babies r' Us. Not only do they not leak, but they can withstand a teething toddler (lots of others have flexible nipples that kiddos can bite through). My daughter is 2 and is on the last stage before a regular cup, and it is going well for us!
TwoXChromosomes X With 17 menstruation isn't really regular. It's not even perfectly regular later on. Best way to track your cycle is some sort of fertility awareness method (I recomment symptothermal). You can go weeks and months without producing an egg, but after that you only got 18 days to start bleeding. If you don't want to be scared, just be aware of your cycle :)
TwoXChromosomes X From what I understand, you shouldn't use anything more than water on your vulva OR your vagina. Basically, get under the stream, get your hand up in your business, and flapple that shit around (Flapple is a very technical term). Anything else stronger than that can mess up the delicate balance of bacteria in your vulva and vagina and cause infections and irritation.
TwoXChromosomes X I did this in June for me and my boyfriend's five year. It worked perfectly for the week I skipped, but after that I had breakthrough bleeding for a week that was only slightly lighter than my normal period. I just kept taking my pills as if nothing happened and everything went back to normal. It kind of sucked to have two periods so close together though.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on the pill for 17 years before I came off it last year, so rest assured I do know a thing or two about it - and never got pregnant while on it!  You can indeed have sex while you skip the placebos.  I never even took my placebos, and went right onto the next pack of pills after my period.  The placebos are designed to protect you but the drop in estrogen and progestin (which occurs when you're not taking the regular pills) permits you to have a period - that's all they are for. 
Parenting X FYI: reddit's opinion on circumcision is a foregone conclusion. It's just one of _those_ topics.  There are some medical benefits and medical risks, as well as cultural ones, how your child is perceived by others, by himself, etc.  Those who say there are no medical benefits are not being honest.  Their objection is not grounded in medicine, but in ethics. You should decide for yourself whether you think circumcision is an ethical issue and act accordingly.  I've met circumcised men who were glad it was done when they were young, and circumcised men who wished it had not been done, so it's not an easy decision.  The American Association of Pediatrics has their [policy here]( ).  Essentially it's the same as what I wrote: there's some benefits and some risks, there should not be _routine_ circumcision, and "parents should determine what is in the best interest of the child" after being given "accurate and unbiased information" and "taking into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions."  Don't let reddit or anyone tell you what to do. Do what you think is in the best interest for your son.  You are the parent: you make medical decisions on behalf of your child, and this is just one drop in an ocean of decisions you'll have to make.
TwoXChromosomes X But it was a sperm that was to be annihilated, not a fertilized egg (And the sperm was going to fertilize the egg and then demand 9 months of hanging-around time. With plan B it *could* be a fertilized egg, though, but in this comic it was one surviving sperm cell).
TwoXChromosomes X this makes me wish I had done more research... I went to both Planned Parenthood and my doctor and both told me I shouldn't get the IUD - that I should have kids first. Being young, I trusted them. I may try again because hormonal options do not like me at all. 
BabyBumps X I'm 37.5 weeks today and I woke up at 5am with my water breaking. Soooo.... pretty clear indicator that the baby is on his way! I'm pretty shocked he decided to come early. I'm having a home birth, I will come back and update with my birth story after this is all over!
TwoXChromosomes X Exactly, and when I think of birth control that can be represented in a rage comic by female "agents" chillin' in your body, I think of hormonal contraceptives, not barrier protection.   Actually I've don't think I've ever heard barrier methods referred to as simply "birth control." You'd say "condoms are an effective birth control method," not "condoms are effective birth control." 
TwoXChromosomes X Don't get the Paragard. I love mine, but if my periods were as severe as yours I wouldn't have gotten it. Not all hormones are created equal and you might do well with the Mirena or a different pill.
TwoXChromosomes X When I got the mirena I was on the couch for a few days in agony. Far worse than cramps. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yep, you can still get it. A word of advice, the doctor will probably ask you to come in to have it inserted while you're on your period (the cervix is softer and more open then, so insertion is easier for women who've not had children), so it requires a little planning. It will hurt like a bitch to have it put in. But the pain goes subsides almost immediately after it's over, and it's nothing some motrin can't fix.
TwoXChromosomes X There have been some pill types which shot my sex drive through the roof. It's just that people talk about negative side effects more.
TwoXChromosomes X Has she tried mini-pills? These are progesterone only pills, so they don't contain any of the estrogen she might be reacting badly to. There are still side effects, but if a sensitivity to estrogen really is the cause of all her bad experiences, this could definitely be what she's looking for.
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you. That is what I am trying to do, hope for the best but prepare for the worst. I kind of feel like something is wrong, the pregnancy symptoms I had a few days ago are gone. (Sore breasts, nausea, etc.) I feel like it's gone and I just want to get it over with. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, the walk in clinic sounds like a great option at the moment. Advice for next time: to prevent UTI drink cranberry juice and lots of water...if you don't want to drink juice than you can just take cranberry vitamin pills :) 
TwoXChromosomes X That may be true, but I think the psychological difference is that a dildo/vibrator is like another penis, while if you are using a condom, it still is your penis pleasuring her.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes I am. That's what's getting so frustrating. It's fully opened, it just doesn't seem to catch anything. I've even made sure but running my finger along the outside of the cup to see if it was still in a folded position or not, and then turning it again. 
TwoXChromosomes X I used a variety of different pills (on and off) from 14 to 21 wiht mixed results (some were great, some had a lot of breathrough bleeding, generally I am SUPER BAD at remembering to take it, even with an alarm) then I was on depo, which made me fat, then the nuva ring (which I loved).  Now I am using condoms lol.
TwoXChromosomes X I just want to make sure people know, dysplasia is NOT, I repeat IS NOT cancer. If your doctor tells you you have dysplasia, YOU DO NOT HAVE CANCER. If your doctor says you have *pre-cancerous* cells, YOU DO NOT HAVE CANCER. If your doctor says you have *carcinoma in-situ* YOU STILL DO NOT HAVE CANCER. The only time you have cancer and cancerous cells is if the Doc explicitly tells you, YOU HAVE CANCER. Does this mean you can be flippant about your gyne health if you hear dysplasia? **NO!* I just wanna make sure women don't see the two together and start freaking out.  [Here's a nice pic that shows the development of cervical cancer]( ) 
TwoXChromosomes X Hopefully it works out great--it might take a while to get it to work properly, there is a bit of a knack to getting it to pop..and thus a bit of a learning curve.  
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds pretty normal. Same thing happened to me, I bled HEAVILY (changed my pad every hour) for nine days, so much pain I couldn't walk. Went to the ER only to have them tell me nothing was wrong. The only reason I went to the ER is because I was afraid of the anemia risk, but I fully expected the pain and bleeding. Your sister will probably experience very very heavy, painful periods for awhile until she adjusts to it.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had to have a couple of colposcopies (sp?) in the past two years.  they aren't fun, but they aren't the worst thing in the world.  The doctor will swab your cervix to look for abnormal cells.  if she sees any, she will take a small sample by cutting out a tiny piece of the abnormal cells.  This feels like a pinch and you might have some cramping.  Take the rest of the day off work if you can and treat yourself afterward.    In my case, the cells were abnormal, but were not cancerous.  Eventually after two colps, 6 months apart, and one more follow up pap, my HPV cleared up on its own.  It is scary, but it's really important to follow your doctor's instructions and follow-up as she recommends.  And you don't like your doctor, you can always find one that you do like.  You don't have to keep going back to some doctor who you don't feel is answering your questions or giving you enough information.  
TwoXChromosomes X What were the downsides of the nuva ring?  I'm terrible with pills just like you and I would need a really low-dose hormone, so I was considering that as an option, but I don't know anyone who'd had one.
TwoXChromosomes X Personally, I think promoting safer sex is always the right thing to do. If she's sexually active already, proper condom use is a MUST!
TwoXChromosomes X Mine flip flops every so often. At the beginning of this year, I had my period at the end of the month. Mid-April I had a mini-period and then skipped in May. In June, my normal period came mid-month, and it's been that way since. It will probably stay mid-month for awhile, and then next year decide to go back to the end of the month. I have no idea why it does this.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, the point is that the respective clusters of cells are fungible. It really does not matter which survives, since they haven't yet differentiated into distinct persons or actual children. You'll get a child from either of them, so which one gets picked and which one gets picked off is really immaterial to this. That's why this doesn't really cross any line, it only seems to because people haven't thought it through. When the objective is to have one child, you want a singleton pregnancy. The details of what particular cell cluster will be the progenitor of that child is generally irrelevant here.
TwoXChromosomes X That's one of the things that definitely works out well, especially on heavy flow days.  The stripe usually absorbs quite a lot though going to the bathroom can often have a lot of liquid dropping in from what hasn't been absorbed yet.  That said, it's better then having it creep in and around you and on to your clothing/bedding/etc.  I'd also sit down with your mom and explain to her your concerns about wearing tampons and the issues you have during heavy days.  If she's not ok with that, see if she's ok with one of the cups.  Otherwise if pads are your only option then yar, that should help you a lot. :)
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds like this is not your first (yeasty) rodeo.... but I've found plain unflavored unsweetened yogurt is a great way to replenish the good bacteria/vajayjay flora.  (Sugar feeds off yeast- so PLAIN yogurt is crucial)
TwoXChromosomes X I have had both. For me clitoral is much easier, especially with oral. They are intense but it a different way than vaginal orgasms. For me they are teeth clenching, sheet grabbing, back arching orgasms. Vaginal for me are deeper intense back scratching, name yelling heavy breathing feeling. Usually we climax together when having intense sex which makes the orgasm sooooooo incredible.  Man he is good. Gonna go home and pounce :)
Parenting X From what I've read:  * The chances of you needing the cord blood are SMALL.   * Even if your child has a disease that can be treated by cord blood, it often shouldn't be their own (such as Leukemia)  Most places I've read suggest donating it to a public cord bank if that is an option, and not bothering with private banking.  The cost of banking was just too high IMO. 
BabyBumps X I think she's talking about delaying cord clamping and cutting until the cord has stopped pulsating (making sure all the blood goes into the baby).
TwoXChromosomes X My gyno said to call in if I decided to go on bc, so I guess I will have my list right beside me when I call. I have discussed my issues with them before, and it was suggested to go on bc if things kept on the same as they had been. But then my periods got magically better...and now they're worse, lol. This body is a mystery! Thanks for the info! I will talk to my girlfriend too, she has been in bc before, but she said her periods had different issues than mine seem to have.
BabyBumps X I've been pregnant twice, each time I was on birth control. The 2nd time I guess you could say it took awhile. Like 9 months. But when those little buggers want thru they will get thru.  Usually i've heard the average is 6 months to a year before someone gets pregnant after trying. Give it a few more months and start charting if your serious about it.   edit: Just to clairify: we werent' trying with this 2nd pregnancy. Birth control failed and I had been using it for 9 months previously without incident. Now we are currently 20 weeks pregnant and expecting a little girl. Getting very excited!
TwoXChromosomes X I dipped a tampon into plain, natural yoghurt and inserted it, was instant relief, my infection was gone in a few days. I used it for a couple of hours, twice a day. But I'd still recommend you go to your doctors anyway since it's your first one but the yoghurt should help till then.
TwoXChromosomes X "Oral sex" is both fellatio and cunnilingus.  She is talking about fellatio. While it *is* oral sex, it is completely different than cunnilingus.  She has restricted her comments to fellatio, but that doesn't mean she is saying cunnilingus is easy.  
TwoXChromosomes X The $1 ones usually involve peeing in a cup and then putting the stick in the cup where the $8 dollar ones you pee right on the stick an look for a faint line and the $16 dollar ones you pee on the stick and it reads out "pregnant" or "not pregnant"  I'm pretty sure they all use the same technology. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think that by the time a child is old enough to realize that having a baby at age 19 and outside of marriage, the child is aware of the options available to a woman in that situation and can safely assume that her mother, like all mothers in that situations, had to weigh her options.  I think you need to tread carefully between explaining to her how difficult it is to be a young single parent so that she doesn't end up in the same situation and having the explanation make her think you resent her or regret the decision.
BabyBumps X Thanks!  We've been TTC for 13 months now, so staying postive is getting a little more difficult!
TwoXChromosomes X I don't get cravings, cramps, mood swings or whatever. but every time I'm on my period I'm like[...]( )  [and...]( )
BabyBumps X I thought I was showing around then too, but then I realized it was bloat when it suddenly disappeared. It makes sense, since baby is so small at 10 weeks.      At 17 weeks is when my stomach finally started rounding into a bump, then around 22ish weeks strangers started to notice. 
TwoXChromosomes X Unfortunately, I think so. I am just finishing mine up and I will have you know, this is the longest period I have had in 10 years. 6 WHOLE days!  /shakes fist at hormones
TwoXChromosomes X Sorry to scare you, but nocturnal sweating can mean nothing, or can mean certain types of cancer (lemphoma!), HIV infection, generalized underlying viral infection and other. You should visit a doctor FIRST OF ALL.
TwoXChromosomes X My lady bits (vagina, cervix, whole surrounding area), took a few weeks to settle down after I got my IUD installed.  Even after a few months, the ManBeast complained of being poked, so I got my strings trimmed super short.  We haven't had any problems since then.  Well, no regular major problems.  I do find that if my cervix is low, and we're having deep sex, that sometimes slight poking still occurs, but nothing like when my strings were long.    I just asked the ManBeast what it felt like when my strings were long and he got poked and he responded that it really hurt and was incredibly uncomfortable.  The problem might be that while we say 'strings', the idea of what your bf views as strings is likely incredibly different than what the strings actually are.  The strings are more like stiff fishing line than anything soft.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, the implant is much better because it is a lower dose of hormones than the shot too.  Your doctor is probably happy for you to stay using the implant without any breaks - just ask them.
TwoXChromosomes X When I was knocked up I had the stabbing pains too - it was different from normal cramping and is apparently what can happen when the egg is embedding in your uterus.   Or it could just be cramping :)  Whoever decided being pregnant and being on your period should feel the exact same is a jackass.  
TwoXChromosomes X i didn't put childbirth up there only cause i was on an epidural most of the time.. and once it was all over.. i was glad i was on the epidural seeing the aftermath.. but it was worth it.
TwoXChromosomes X Popping a couple of cranberry pills, or having a glass of cranberry juice, won't hurt either! 
BabyBumps X Don't be disappointed.  It took us three years, one miscarriage, and now we're 15 weeks along with our little thumper!  I had an awful OB in the beginning that said nature would take it's course (this after about 9 months of actively TTC).  Turns out there were other medical issues that were preventing a viable pregnancy, which we didn't find out about until we went to an RE.  Good luck, it'll happen!
TwoXChromosomes X I've usually finished a decent number of times before he cums, but in the off chance he came early (this has yet to happen) he would finish me off until I was, also, satisfied.  My sexual satisfaction is just as important to him as his sexual satisfaction.
TwoXChromosomes X Sadly, I started somewhere around 10 or 11.... I was an early bloomer... By the time I was 11, my breasts were a C cup, and I got my period for the first time in the 4th grade :(
TwoXChromosomes X I think the answer to this will depend on the female:  My cramps feel much like a charlie horse. But, in my abdomen that also goes around to my back, and gives me the shits for days. Once that intense OUCH charlie horse feeling dies down it becomes more like a muscle ache.  The pattern is: Sharp &amp; intense, then dull &amp; annoying - in a cycle, for 2 days.
TwoXChromosomes X The feeling you get just after you get punched in the gut really hard and your stomach is still up in your ribcage a bit and you are waiting for your organs to move back into place and it doesn't quite sting hurt yet but it's that deep internal ache.
BabyBumps X Not so much the horse riding pain, but the shooting pains in my crotch are the issue. It feels like i'm being stabbed and i can't even stand up straight when it happens. Its all I can do not to scream.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not in the US, so my Depo injection is already free :) Our government pays for it.  With the Depo shot, I am injected with the same hormones as in pregnancy. I personally have no side effects other than having no periods, and I feel that I get less angry nowadays. It worked out to be all up-side for me :)  Some people have really bad reactions, especially to the Depo shot, because it is a high dose of hormones. Some of the bad side-effects I've seen women complain of online are weight gain, depression and lowered libido. -topics/birth-control/birth-control-shot-depo-provera-4242.htm  My libido is higher than ever and I find my husband sexier than ever. I have to masturbate every day for my pelvic floor physiotherapy, so I find that helps.
TwoXChromosomes X I think it can definitely vary. I've had it be a really sharp, biting pain that I can feel through to my lower back to a milder, kind of duller but persistent pain. I've had it so bad that I've been reduced to cold sweats and pale skin to times where I've been totally functional just kind of fatigued. I think the diarrhea thing is kind of apt though. It's the kind of pain that just makes you feel totally helpless to, and 100% blows.   Also, welcome to TwoX!  
TwoXChromosomes X It's sad that we're so prudish as a culture that we can't deal with somebody whipping out a boob to feed their own child.  I can't help but think that if boobs were less taboo to begin with, this wouldn't be an issue.
TwoXChromosomes X So I have absolutely no problem with this woman breastfeeding in the airplane. That's her business.   I do have a problem with that photo in the article, though. If that's what she looked like while in the plane, breast feeding, that is not discreet at all.   I think that if a woman needs to breastfeed in public,  she has a responsibility to be a discreet as possible. I'm an incredibly liberal person. However, I DO feel rather uncomfortable when I see a woman with her tit hanging out and a baby suckling. It just is inappropriate.  I know for myself, personally, (if I were to have a child) I would never breastfeed my baby in a public place if simply for the fact that I don't want people watching that sort of thing.
TwoXChromosomes X The disgusting was for the changing on a table.  I breast fed all of mine in public, so that wasn't it.
TwoXChromosomes X I know the large majority of moms aren't like that and I know that most women are discreet. All I was saying is that it never hurts to be discreet, I'm not even saying the women on the plane wasn't discreet, all I'm saying is I don't think that flopping it all out in the middle of a public place is ok, not everybody wants to see that.
TwoXChromosomes X It's not even the plane thing I have a problem with, if she truly was being discreet then I think it is unfair. What I hold a problem with is the moms that make **absolutely no effort to be discreet**. I don't care how "natural" it is, breastfeeding is a choice and most places provide a mother and baby room. At the end of the day, walking around with your tit out is gross and awkward, breastfeeding or not. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm guessing that you haven't ever breastfed.  What you consider a "lack of discreteness" is just the way that some babies and mothers prefer to nurse.  There is nothing indecent about breasts or breastfeeding. I feel sorry that you have been warped by society to feel offended by them.
TwoXChromosomes X Breastfeeding and urinating are two very different things though. One can be done in a bathroom stall, the other not so much.   Why should more visible breast be okay on a teenager in a tank top than a mother feeding her baby? I know we have all seen the cover of Maxim at our local book store and I'd say most of those women have way more breast showing than a woman feeding her kid.   Doesn't that seem a little backwards and off? Showing them off as sexual objects yay! Food tools, booooo. What?
TwoXChromosomes X If I may pry, why didn't you like the nuvaring?  It's currently my preferred method and I have the same BC fears that you do.
TwoXChromosomes X darling! there shouldn't be any pain at all. if you're nervous you might tense up. Tell the doctor that you're nervous and she should make efforts to make your more comfortable.  the exam takes about 5 minutes, don't worry
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I hate the spotting that comes with birth control.  I kind of like having my surprise period, except for the whole unknown pregnancy thing!
TwoXChromosomes X My yearly average is exactly 28 days usually. But that is split between a 20 day - 60 day cycle. During the odd year it is thrown off by just randomly not having a period for six to eight months. 
TwoXChromosomes X Are you serious?! You deny that in normal men the urethra ends in the penis and urination is thus a normal function of the penis?  (By the way, not all eunuchs have undergone a penectomy. Usually it's just castration.)
TwoXChromosomes X Over here in Sweden they recommend it for people who are note yet sexually active. Thing is, once you've had a few sex partners there is a decent chance you've already been exposed to the virus, and hence there's little point to have the HPV shot.   At least that is what they tell us. 
TwoXChromosomes X First off, you need to go to a gyno at your age. I don't know where you live, but in the US they recommend pap smears starting at 21 to start monitoring for cervical cancer, regardless of sexual activity. At your age, you shouldn't have irregular cycles, so you really need to go get checked out.   What little advice I can give:   Request, no, *demand* a female gyno. I've had male gynos and it's just awkward, and I don't have nearly the fears you have going in.   Mention your apprehension to the nurse when you go to your appointment. Nurses are usually more empathetic (in my limited experience) than the doctor, and they can prep the doctor with information before she sees you. Let the doctor know when she comes in, too. If you aren't happy with the doctor's attitude, ask to reschedule with another doctor. You need a supportive environment for this so take your time.  Some little warnings, not to scare, but to prepare you:  Speculums (they use them to examine your vagina) are always cold. Speak up if it hurts. I didn't my first time and I regret it. When you're a virgin, it will press on the hymen and can hurt, so let them know if it does.   Most of the stuff that does on you won't feel all that much. It's sort of like getting very light cramps as far as sensation.   The little gappy paper gowns were invented by a sadist, I swear. :P   Good luck, good job on taking control of your health, and big hugs to you.     
TwoXChromosomes X I was a virgin until I was 24, when I got married. I went to the gyno about 3 months before I got married so I could be put on birth control, but I asked if he could just do an ultrasound of my ovaries and not do the pap smear. It wasn't until after I started having sex (and thus, was more comfortable with someone being down there) that I went to have the full exam. You can try this. Just call up your gyno and ask. If they don't want to do it like that, call another one.   I love my gyno (yes, he is a he). When you make your first appointment with him, he takes you to an office, not an exam room, and you sit and talk first. He asks you your history and such. I don't know how common this is, as he is the only gyno I have had. He also gave me my IUD when I was 25 and had never had kids. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've been in the same boat, and the best thing is to take a fairly high dose of birth control pills. Endometriosis is essentially growth of the uterine lining outside the uterus, so controlling the growth is crucial in controlling the problem, and birth control does just that. If you're on BC and still having trouble, you might not be on a high enough dose, so trying that might help. Ask your doctor about that, and if he/she isn't helpful, then as someone else said, go see another doctor. If it is really serious, there are some GnRH antagonists out there that essentially put the body in a state of menopause, and probably be worth trying before a hysterectomy. not that wiki is always the best place, but it has some good info on the topic and might help you better understand what's going on and what your options are. !
BabyBumps X Heart palpitations here...luckily not so much this time. Other than that, first pregnancies started restless legs syndrome (which never went away, btw) and a bout of bronchitus about 3-4 months in, 2nd pregnancy was placenta previa, but that luckily cleared, and now for the 3rd pregnancy, pelvic girdle pain, which is quickly worsening, possibly to SPD. Oh, and we're high risk for Down's this time too, but so far everything looks "normal" (declined an amnio).
TwoXChromosomes X an early miscarriage would cause pretty noticeable cramping and there would be a decent amount of blood. especially if what she "passed" was the size of a peanut, that is the size of a fetus at around 7 weeks, so there would be a LOT of blood if it were a miscarriage.   edit-- a trip to the OB is definitely a good idea :P
Parenting X "walking Miracle"  "miraculously survived"  Miracle? Really? I would think modern science may have had something to do with it.  "he has endured 14 surgeries, and has been under General anesthetic 20 times so far, he has had well over 100 X-rays, and has hospitalized in the Pediatric ICU for over 14 weeks"
TwoXChromosomes X a diva cup. seriously. it's great not having to change all the time, and way more comfortable than a tampon or pad.
TwoXChromosomes X You can try to drink lots of water as well as cranberry juice to attempt to flush it out of your system, but I would say after 24-48 hours, if it has not subsided at all, then you should go see a doctor. If you are sexually active, it could be something worse than just a UTI...
TwoXChromosomes X You are very lucky!  My period would be fine if it were light... and if sometimes it didn't last for a month and a half straight!
TwoXChromosomes X Me!  The warts thing happened years ago. I flipped out at first, so I feel funny telling you to not flip out... but, yeah, don't flip out. =)  &gt;I haven't had many sexual partners and thought I was being careful.  There are well over 100 strains of HPV. Most people have some form of HPV. HPV can pass through a condom. HPV can also be transmitted through contact of the little bit of skin not covered by condom or dam. Ever had a wart on your finger? That's HPV! Warts are not a symptom of every strain of HPV.   You can carry a wart causing HPV for years and never develop warts (the person you got it from may not know they have it). You could have contracted it a few weeks ago or years ago. The warts will go away on their own over time (usually takes a year or two I've been told) or you can get them removed by one of a few methods a doctor can explain to you. I used Aldara cream. It burned, but got rid of my warts in a few weeks. I've never had another outbreak. Some people do. Some don't.  Genital warts are really common. HPV is really common. Don't feel dirty or embarrassed. Well, try not to. Seek treatment. Have a doctor explain it all to you. Get a pelvic exam every year (which you should do anyways) and that's about it. You didn't do anything wrong. And please remember, due to the nature of HPV, whoever gave it to you likely had no clue he/she has it.
Parenting X Pacifiers and bottles are def not good after a certain point. Sippies aren't either. A straw cup is best.   Breastfeeding/nursing is different from pacifiers, though. It's about oral develpment. Sippies and bottles and pacifiers are bad for oral development.  It sucks because at that age kids still need something to help them soothe themselves.   Maybe a lovey? 
TwoXChromosomes X Haven't tried their panties. Bought a diva cup from them though. I recommended them to my mum who was having some pre-menopausal lady issues and had her period for ONE WHOLE MONTH. 
TwoXChromosomes X [Calcium]( -for-Menstrual-Health).  I take 2400mg a day along with vitamin D.  I'm still crampy and  a little bloaty, but my mood and other symptoms are much, MUCH reduced.   
Parenting X &gt;Home birth vs hospital births and different pool sizes - common knowledge, but backed up by the CDC here: _11.pdf)  Not sure what your point is here. I don't believe there was ever a dispute that there are fewer people in the US doing out of hospital births (not just home births, which are distinctly different from birthing center births).  &gt;high risk pregnancies go to the hospital - common knowledge  Yup. I didn't say otherwise. It would be foolish for high-risk pregnancies not to go to a doctor. That being said, not every pregnancy is high-risk and not every pregnancy needs to be dealt with by a surgeon.  &gt;delivery disasters happen extremely fast - based on direct accounts from several family doctors, surgeons, and anesthesiologists who have personally RUN mothers to the OR  Birth centers, which you seem to be ignorant of, are equipped to handle most birth emergencies as well as a hospital can. This is common knowledge. In fact, some birth centers are located adjacent to hospitals. Further, to be a Certified Nurse Midwife, you have to have extensive medical training. CNMs aren't just old women pulled off the street to get towels and boil hot water, you know.  A lot of perinatal emergencies are actually caused by unnecessary intervention on the part of doctors such as premature induction of labor, unnecessary drugs, the use of unapproved ulcer drugs to induce labor, unnecessary cesarean sections, etc. Again, common knowledge.  &gt;Childbirth the number one cause of death for women throughout history - very common knowledge, but here's the wikipedia page with lots of backup _death  A lot has changed over the past several thousands of years, so has midwifery. This is common knowledge.  &gt;So lets see your source for "Home births have better safety rates even when only comparing low risk planned home births to low risk planned hospital births."  Seeing as I never made *that* statement, I don't feel particularly rushed to defend it. If I have free time, I'll do the research for you to satiate your lazy curiosity. Seeing as you only believe there are two options, hospital births and home births, I imagine you are too willfully ignorant to care, though.
TwoXChromosomes X I had a bit of a delay once, but still not toooo far from my normal period (I think 7 days tops). I think worrying about the possibility of being pregnant was just stressing me out :)
Parenting X My advice is if there is no absolute need for a bottle don't do it.  Your baby is a month old.  He will start to have a once or twice a day 2-4 hour bigger gap between feedings.  I have seen many moms end up giving up breastfeeding with good intentions of just so she can get more sleep.  The reason being is breastmilk is a supply &amp; demand business.  For every missed feeding your wife should be pumping.  Otherwise she is telling her body to slow down how much milk it is making.  This can become a slippery slope of starting formula supplementing and eventually not producing any breastmilk at all.  I strongly advise she seek out a local La Leche League group for support and advise with these things.  I am more than happy to answer any further questions about how the moms body reacts to nursing and anything else in regards to breastfeeding.
Parenting X while breastfeeding is best, dont be hard on those parents who can't. My son was born 6.5 weeks early and was in the NICU for over 3 weeks. He would breastfeed(with issues) once per day. All his other feedings were bottle fed ( i pumped for my son for 10+ weeks) and bottle fed ( when he got home he didnt want the boob, wasn't good at it to begin with) after that long my supply diminished to nothing and I had to make the tough decision to switch to formula, with no support or encouragement from my doc. In fact he made me feel like a bad mom who just wasn't trying hard enough.  I had seeked assistance and help from lactation consultants both at the hospital and after we were home
TwoXChromosomes X I like the pads in the black boxes, only problem with the tampons is they're too big for me. I can only wear light flow tampons because regulars never fit, even though my flow is not light.
TwoXChromosomes X I had a ruptured appendix once. The docs assumed because I was 18 and the pain was slightly off placement that I was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy. They didn't care that I kept telling them I was a virgin.   Anyway, turns out my appendix was not in the usual position (about 4% of people have a misplaced appendix?) so they didn't catch it and it caused an abscess in my abdomen and a month later they removed it. I have a giant  up and down scar like I had an old school cesarean section.   But the pain IS similar to period cramps, dammit!
BabyBumps X I'm probably as far along as you, and I had a bit of success at a place like TjMaxx/Marshall's/Ross (Beall's here in FL).  The selection was small, but they did have maternity jeans for a good price.  They had a decent amount of Liz Lange stuff for cheaper than Target sells it.  Step up from thrifting, but not full retail.
BabyBumps X I just went to Target and bought a pair of maternity pants for 50% off, $15!  All of their summerish clothes are on sale right now.  If you have a Target near you, try them.  I can't fit into maternity tops just yet so I bought some cute tops in the regular section.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on maternity clothes either, Target is definitely good for that. 
BabyBumps X My cousin got a few pairs of jeans at Ross and she says that she loves them!  I'm not a very good thrift shopper (I lack the patience and the skill), so I splurged and got a pair of jeans at the [Motherhood Maternity]( ) store, best purchase I've made so far!!
Parenting X I know it's disappointing to not have a shot at the natural birth, but after 30 hours of labor and 3 hours of pushing followed by an emergency c-section, I wish it were scheduled.  Since mine was an emergency...I will tell you about the my friend's scheduled C.  I was invited into the room to share the experience.  Once the medication is administered, my friend felt no pain.  They had a curtain up so that she or her husband did not have to see the procedure.  Her husband stayed by her head and supported her.  I had a pretty good view of the incision and it was not bad at all.  There were a few moments of pressure for her as they removed her baby, but overall, the procedure was so smooth and easy and was over in a matter of minutes.  Her recovery took a few weeks.  It's hard at first bc you want to do everything but you can't, so make sure that you have good support to help you in those first weeks.  My friend said she wished she had let people help her more in those first few weeks but was worried they wouldn't bond properly if she wasn't the one doing everything.  You and your baby will bond even if you let people help you.  Best of luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I've never had an issue with pap smears. My doctor has me lie on my side in the fetal position and it's no problemo. I don't enjoy the speculum but it's not painful if it's done right, just uncomfortable. Though I did have the awesome experience of getting to feel my uterus through my abdomen, for such a small thing it sure releases a lot of blood.
TwoXChromosomes X The latest guide lines from the American Cancer Society suggest getting your first pap at 21 but having general pelvic exams earlier. I had my first pelvic exam when I started getting my period and I believe this is still recommended. 
TwoXChromosomes X My bone density was lacking when they tested it after several years on the shot.  Osteoporosis runs in my family and my old doc (who moved, or I'd still be with him) and I decided to stop the depo shot, and go back to more traditional methods like the pill.    I did enjoy it.  I didn't enjoy the weight gain from it, or the kind of nuttiness it caused me.  =/  And I would perhaps like to have kids sooner than later, so I'm not looking for an extended method such as depo or an implant.  
TwoXChromosomes X Getting to feel bits you wouldn't otherwise feel is awesome. I used to work with a doctor who always did this kind of extra thing for her patients. She always asked the ladies if they wanted to put the speculum in themselves and was so kind, gentle and respectful to her patients (mainly sex workers where I was) that she was overbooked for paps and STI checks for months in advance. Luckily she trains other doctors, too. 
TwoXChromosomes X It will hurt more if you're not relaxed or if they don't lube it up enough. Otherwise it shouldn't really be painful. 
TwoXChromosomes X No need to come off as rude. You are correct, you can't have a mentrual period while pregnant, but you can have regular vaginal bleeding which can last up to 5 days every month while pregnant. This is why women think it is their period and don't think they are pregnant. -you-have-your-menstrual-period-while-pregnant  If you are really that concerned then take the Plan B. Then if she is due to have her period, certain tests can test up to 5 days before her missed period. I doubt she is pregnant at all.
BabyBumps X Good luck! I had hyperemesis and ended up in the ER a lot and had to stay 2 times in the hospital. There wasn't a single day that I was pregnant that I didn't throw up. :(  
TwoXChromosomes X I was like this for a bit with one guy I was dating...I just attributed it to how uncomfortable I was around him all the time because I haven't had this problem at all since we split...I know that's not very helpful but I had it and now it's gone so...knowledge never hurt anyone?
TwoXChromosomes X I know I use pads at home, and tampons when I am out and about.  I have found more frequent changing of the tampon prevents some of the extra cramping. For me, anyway.
TwoXChromosomes X I use mine with my IUD, no problems so far. But I did see a post from a girl who said the suction caused her IUD to come out. I'm careful to break the suction before removing. Either way, there's no way I could ever go back to pads/tampons.
TwoXChromosomes X When "parental rights" mean the right to deny young people their own access to sensible and necessary health care, those rights don't mean shit.
TwoXChromosomes X It is not a human life if it cannot sustain life separate of its mother's womb (and )I use the term "mother" only in the biological sense.  In the first trimester (and through part of the second), a fetus is simply a parasitic grouping of cells.  I have never had an abortion.  I, personally, would never have an abortion.  But I did miscarry at 17 weeks and I can assure you that what ended up being expelled was not alive.   
TwoXChromosomes X if you pee all the time, use a "light" tampon.  I used to have that problem as well, but I've become a diva cup convert and I don't think I'd ever go back..
TwoXChromosomes X So odd, I agree that pregnancy isn't a disease and I've heard that phrase actually spoken by those who want to move toward more natural childbirths and less stressful pregnancies.  I don't know how it makes any sense in terms of contraception though.  Something doesn't need to actually be a disease/illness in order for it to be part of preventative health.  To deny that millions of women and people do not want to be parents/pregnant at least at the current time is ridiculous.  People like to spout off about how great life is, yet the reality is that without birth control people would be having children they are completely not ready for.  It's also easy to say you are against contraception, but what less available contraception means is more abortions.  If you are against both, I still think most would say they do not want more abortions.  Those who think life is sacred should be supporting contraception, not condemning it.  Paying for contraception also makes more sense for society because a child especially one born to someone who doesn't want it or cannot afford it is certainly going to cost society and the government a lot more money than providing birth control. 
TwoXChromosomes X hmm...I use a divacup (have since they came out to replace the keeper) and have an IUD and my obgyn didn't say anything about it when I got the IUD put in 2 years ago...      Edit: say goodbye to the super light periods with an IUD, though....I used to have a really easy short, light, cramp-free period, but I had truble with birth control and thought to myself *an IUD would be so much more "natural" than hormonal pills*....it wasn't until I had the worst cramps ever that I realized there isn't much that's natural about sticking a foreign metal body up there either.  The horrible cramping dissipated after the first 6 periods and went away entirely after a year and a half, but the flow is still much heavier and clottier than before.  
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, Mirena.  It hurt coming out, but nothing like going in.  I had some cramping for about 30 seconds, then mild discomfort for a couple of hours.  Some spotting as well.
BabyBumps X If you're late, take a HPT. Why do you think you may be pregnant if you've been using condoms?
TwoXChromosomes X A gyno has seen some pretty nasty things. Also, he/she has looked at thousands of vaginas so there is literally nothing about your crotch that could be surprising. So don't worry about what the gyno thinks. They're always super professional and know how to talk you through it so you're not too uncomfortable. If you find yourself being awkward, ask some questions or just laugh uncontrollably. I did the latter and it ended up being a fun time. Good luck! :)
TwoXChromosomes X My first pap smear involved an old lady feeling me up. I tried to think of my boyfriend doing the breast exam (to ease my tension). Then I looked up and I saw the little old lady. Well I couldn't help but laugh. I would just say, it's awkward. Women need to have pap smears done. So embrace the awkwardness!   Also, don't be afraid to ask questions! Your gyno is there to make sure you are healthy, yet at ease. You have a right to know what he or she is doing or plans to do for your pap. Good luck deary!
TwoXChromosomes X the Diva Cup is different; Instead is disposable and sits a lot higher in your vaginal canal, while the Diva Cup is reusable and sits a bit lower. I haven't used Instead myself, but I've read that Diva Cups can be easier to get aligned correctly.  The very best thing about the Diva Cup is that it can hold a LOT of fluid, which means you can wait longer between changes. If you have an extremely heavy flow, you'll still have to empty it every couple of hours, but even on my heaviest days, I can keep the cup in for at least 6 hours with no leaks. It's entirely possible that you could get through an entire school day without having to empty it, which would be much more convenient and less stressful! :)
TwoXChromosomes X Well you could get CVS (chorionic villi sampling) to verify the blood test, if you wanted. 
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on the person.Do you mean she just finished her pack of progesterone, so she's on her 'period' week? Was this her first pack of it?   Her body will take some getting used to getting nudged into having a period, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if her period still went another week or two without showing up.   Also, why are you worried? That she might be pregnant? 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;because I did have a doctor that told me my cysts were "no big deal"   Yah, I had a doctor who told me that, too. Then at 20, I landed in the hospital because of the agonising pain caused by a 12cm cyst on one ovary that was threatening to rupture. They had to cut me open, remove the giant cyst, the ovary it killed, and part of a fallopian tube. It then took the better part of 3 months to recover.  Any doctor who doesn't take ovarian cysts seriously would not be a doctor of mine for very much longer.
TwoXChromosomes X I have/had PCOS - dunno if I still 'have' it because I yanked out my reproductive organs to get away from the fucking problems it caused a few years ago.   As I said in a comment below, I started having pains that lasted a couple months - until I landed in the hospital for major surgery to remove a huge cyst. I suggest you find a way to get an ultrasound as soon as possible, because you could have a similar problem, and if it *is* a large cyst and it bursts, it could potentially kill you.   
TwoXChromosomes X IUDs sounded good until I realized that the one that would make my period lighter has hormones (not sure I want to go down that road again with something so expensive as an IUD) and the one that would make it heavier does not have hormones (and my period is already crazy heavy).  I thought some kinds of spermicides were less likely to cause infections?  Doesn't it depend on the form they come in, or are they all pretty bad?
TwoXChromosomes X I found that there was virtually no smell.  I mean period blood always smells a bit metallic, but I never noticed it unless my nose was close to it while I was emptying it.  I think the gross smell of tampons and pads occur from a combination of the absorbed period blood just sitting there and the icky deodorants/chemicals that are in both of those things.  I had the idea too that the period blood may start to smell bad after being in there for up to 12 hours but it did not whatsoever.  I also found that in the first month there was some very light spotting, but I never actually spilled it.  I actually find that spotting can occur anyway, but usually because my period has started before I put it in so it can't "catch" everything, but I just use a pantiliner and it's no big deal.  You could of course insert it prior to getting your period to lessen this, although I think it possibly could still occur when you empty and reinsert the diva cup anyway.  Hope this helps, I really love the DivaCup, it weirdly lessened my cramps and makes me feel a lot fresher and happier than when I used tampons. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;if you are over a certain age you should be going in for regular paps and pelvic exams, even if you are not sexually active.  o_o what is this "certain age" and please tell me it's, like, 65.
BabyBumps X You should ask what other options there are for induction if it really does come to that.  When I was induced they put in a cervix ripening agent that helped get things moving.  They said that was a good option since I was about 2 cm dilated but not really effaced.  It was a little uncomfortable while they placed it but it was just a tiny pill like thing that worked for about 4 hours and helped get things going.    In any case, I hope you go in to labor spontaneously!  Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I was on depo for six months. My period did stop but my mood swings were horrible. I decided not to get the third shot but it took me six months to get it out of my system - during that time, I had nasty side effects: facial cysts, acne, my skin tone was uneven, vaginal dryness and PMS.  I will never go back to depo. So... Don't get another shot.
TwoXChromosomes X This is kind of ridiculous - both of these have the exact same ingredients:  norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol. They're more or less the same pill. Click on the ingredients [here]( -35.html). Even if the other pill has different concentrations it's still likely you'll have similar side effects. I would have thought your doctor would switch it up a bit :/  I have PCOS and have used Diane 35 and Femina 35 (cyproterone, ethinyl estradiol), best reaction is to Ortho Evra patches (norelgestromin, ethinyl estradiol). Patches really are more comfortable and I don't have to worry about vomiting or diarrhea after taking the pill. Ask your doctor, I think they'd be suitable for you.  P.S. If you're uncomfortable with your doctor, find a new one. For me it seems they didn't even listen to you if they prescribed the same thing with a different name.
BabyBumps X I echo the sentiment that a CNM is a good route. I too would like to have an unmedicated birth. But I also want to be sure that, if something should go wrong, that there is the best medical care quickly available. A CNM in a hospital or birth center is an excellent middle-ground. 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, I don't really know anything about the science behind ammenorhea or anorgasmia. Regardless, I have a few questions/suggestions.  First, you said that you have trouble masturbating because you have trouble "coming up with fantasies." Do you watch/read porn? I've found that if I'm having trouble thinking of something, pornography (or even erotic literature) definitely helps. Alternatively, when I masturbate I usually like to think about my boyfriend and our latest sex session...  Also, do you use only your fingers or have you tried toys? If you haven't tried a vibrator, you may want to- many women find it easier to orgasm while using one.  I'm sure it's difficult, but I would just recommend trying to relax and not thinking about it. If while you're masturbating or while you're having sex (especially while having sex) you're thinking, God, I just can't orgasm, then you're not concentrating on how good the sex feels. It's much easier to orgasm if you're not thinking- if you just let yourself experience the feelings and let go.  Apart from that, I don't have much advice-- only wanted to say good luck and I hope you find a solution soon.
TwoXChromosomes X Did you talk about this with your doctor? Do you know which strain you have?  Without knowing the specifics of your case, it's difficult to give you advice. But *in general* HPV is not *that* serious. About **3 out of 4** Americans will contract a strain of HPV at some point in their lives.  Most HPV infections clear up on their own - 70% within a year and 90% within two years.  Maybe I'm doing a bad job of saying this, but my points are:  1) Contracting HPV is nothing to be ashamed about. The vast majority of Americans are going to get it at some point.  2) Most HPV infections clear up on their own. Only a small minority of cases lead to serious complications.  3) If you haven't already, you should talk to your doctor about it, to get some solid medical advice and facts.  EDIT: Also, it is very possible to acquire HPV even with regular condom use. Condoms aren't especially effective at reducing transmission rate with this virus.
TwoXChromosomes X From what my doctor told me apparently they only offer Gardasil to women up to age 24 because after 24 they just assume you have some strain of HPV. It's that common. And, like herpes, condom use does not always stop HPV from spreading. Basically, if you're sexually active you're going to have to deal with HPV at some point in your life. No need to blame yourself or be ashamed, it's much more common then you think and there are SO many different strains. My old roommate has some random strain that eventually turned out to be harmless but was still a form of HPV.
TwoXChromosomes X That's quite strange. For your cycle to have just changed out of nowhere. Are you taking any type of birth control? I know when I got on the type I'm taking things were whacked for 2/3 months, and then again just recently. Have you changed your diet recently? Started or stopped working out?
BabyBumps X I do have a breast pump, and was considering using this to help get things started. My question is, will this force me to start producing breast milk and if so, won't I be pumping the colostrum that my baby needs?
BabyBumps X My water broke during pushing the second time, and the first time it broke right before pushing (during transition). I'm just curious as to why you'd have ARM just because your water hadn't broken prior to pushing.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you talked to your Gyn? I know you're 14 and it might seem hard or embarrasing, but I think you should talk to your doctor about it. They can at least get you on birth control pills which will help regulate your periods.
BabyBumps X Hi, I'm a CNM and I just had my first baby in July, so I've been thinking about these things from both sides of the aisle for a while now  :)  My husband is a doctor, too, not OB.  We compromised on what I wanted (homebirth with a midwife) and what he wanted (hospital) and I had the baby in the hospital with a CNM and the support of a doula.  The doula was WONDERFUL!  She came to our house when I was starting into active labor, made helpful suggestions about positions to try and ways to deal with the contractions, and then helped us decide when to go to the hospital.  It was really, really important to me not to go in until I was well into active labor, because a lot of births that I've seen that have turned into the epidural/stalled labor/pitocin/c-section spirals have begun with the woman being admitted before she is actually in labor.  Depending on the facility and the midwifery practice, you may not be able to have your CNM for continuous labor support.  Many CNMs work in shifts.  I encourage you to get a doula to have with you for the entire labor.   My CNM was extremely flexible and was able to help me negotiate things I wanted with the nursing staff: intermittent monitoring, freedom of movement, to get into the tub, push how I wanted, and to have my baby with me continuously (all this within the realm of not having any complications of course; if anything went south I wanted the staff to know I understood they had to do what they had to do).  Your husband will probably not understand your motivations for wanting an unmedicated birth until he sees it  :)  That was the case with my husband, anyway.  He had never seen what I thought of as a "normal" birth, where the woman spent most of the labor moving around, not stuck in  bed with monitors attached, not getting cervical checks every two hours, etc.  He could understand that epidurals are associated with increased use of pitocin, which is associated with nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings, and with instrumental birth, which is associated with third and fourth degree perineal tears.  Before the birth I asked him to follow the doula's lead with ways to be supportive.  He needed to just be a dad during the birth, not to have his doctor-hat on.  He knew that I was very aware of all my pain med options and would ask for them if and when I wanted them.    After the birth he was really stunned with how different it was than all the births he had done as a resident, and how quickly I was back on my feet and healing afterwards.  I really don't think there was any way for me to explain it to him before.  He just had to be there  :)    I wish you guys the best, and I think it's great you're thinking about these things beforehand.  One thing that shook up my view of birth was that, in the end, it was 12 hours long, and then it was done.  Then you have a baby to raise!  That really does eclipse the birth, or at least it sure did for me.  
BabyBumps X Oh yes- after the placenta I had a post partum hemorrhage and my husband was really relieved we were in the hospital.  The interventions done could and would all have been done at home with a competent midwife, but my husband and hell, probably I too, would have been a lot more nervous had we been dealing with it at home.  I am particularly more comfortable with nurses, CNMs and OBs when dealing with emergencies because I am more confident in their training.  Frankly you can never really be sure with a CPM.  Their certifications are dodgier.
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you. Since I bled a bunch at the beginning, I thought my lining had been shed. Apparently my body was just preparing for the second round. 
TwoXChromosomes X Right, but spiders, bacteria, weeds, etc. do not have the same rights and protections as a human life, which is what he considers a fertilized embryo to be.
BabyBumps X I felt my first kicks at 17 weeks. I usually felt kicks about every hour. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 17, and started my period when I was 15. I've never really been that regular, though generally my cycle has fluctuated around 5-6 weeks, which always worried me enough as it is.   However, I recently went 66 days without a period. It's since been and gone, and the actual period was as regular as it always is, it's just my cycle length that worries me.   Should I be especially worried, or is it normal to be irregular like this? 
TwoXChromosomes X For prevention, make sure you pee before and after sex, drink plenty of water, and take cranberry pills. I used to get UTI's way too often, and these things helped a ton. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had this exact issue and didn't have my period for 8 months. I was on birth control for half the time and then went off to see if not having the hormones would fix it. It didn't. But anyway, are you on birth control? My gynecologist said that sometimes birth control can stop ovulation completely and that is it perfectly okay. But then you could also be having a hormone or thyroid problem. Those are checked with blood tests and treated with medications. My tests came back negative and I was put back on birth control(a different brand this time) and my period came back. It's still a little iffy and irregular but it's definitely back. So the conclusion here is that you should still go to a gynecologist to get checked out but it wasn't that hard to fix.
TwoXChromosomes X No fun :( I gave mine 2 years and finally had it removed, the cramping, spotting, and mood swings never got any better, and my periods were heavier than before I had it inserted. Give it a few more months, hopefully you'll have better luck than I did!
TwoXChromosomes X Mine are usually sore for about a week before my period... I have not been happy for the past week and a half as it decided to stay longer this month...
TwoXChromosomes X If you are really worried about being pregnant you could ask your doctor for a blood test.  I did that once when I had missed my period for a couple months.  The reason I had skipped was because I was coming off of birth control and my body was re adjusting.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Some of them actually do say it's bad while they are getting it and call the people performing the procedure murderers.   Frankly, those people are worse. They're the ones who made the decision to have the abortion, not the doctor who performs it. If someone truly believes abortion is murder, and does it anyway they're a pretty awful person.
TwoXChromosomes X I didn't know it was possible either. At first I thought maybe she was having false labor contractions, which can happen, but they never stopped. The birth center called it "slow to start" labor.   We are so happy they are both healthy and safe, no matter how she was delivered. 
BabyBumps X True, it is important to realize how big a decision to have a child is. I think the OP seems to be grasping that this is a very serious situation and seems to be asking a lot of the right questions.  But abortion is also a decision that a lot of people take too lightly without considering both the short-term and long-term emotional effects (personal and those in the relationship with the father). This is also very worth researching.  There is also adoption to consider. There are so many couples aching for a child to give a great life to.
BabyBumps X I felt our little girl at 14 weeks and my husband felt her around 19/20 weeks for the first time. The kicks were very faint for him at first but by 24/25 weeks he definitely felt her on a regular basis.   It only gets better. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; but if we view a fetus as a potential person rather than an actual person,   Sure, "if," but why should we? What makes a person? I don't believe viability is a good criterion of personhood. We don't see that applied in other areas.  I know pregnancy can be very hard on a woman, but I think we can all agree that death is worse. If the fetus is a person, susceptibility to bronchitis doesn't justify their death. 
BabyBumps X We are 34 weeks along. Right now I'm really looking forward to not being pregnant anymore, haha :P  But with baby I'm excited to see what kind of personality my little boy will have and I am also excited to teach him things. I've also been told by everyone that when baby is finally here, there is no other feeling like the bond/love that you feel so I am really looking forward to that, also :)
TwoXChromosomes X I absolutely adore my Mooncup. I never could wear tampons for some reason, but I got used to the cup really quickly. I was a virgin when I started using it and at first it looked a bit intimidating, but thanks to the LJ [menstrual cup community]( -cups.livejournal.com/) I learned about the different kinds of folds that make the insertion a lot easier. That place is chock-full of relevant info, experiences, fixes to problems, it's pretty much the perfect place for all your cup needs.  It's unlikely you'll feel the cup at all once it's in, so no saturation with peeing. The cup has a stem, but most people cut it off completely so the whole thing is inside the vagina and nothing at all hangs out. The only time I can feel the cup is when it's getting full because it moves a bit lower.
TwoXChromosomes X If you use the lotion, not the ointment or salve, and only use a little on skin, not membrane, it should be okay. Call your GYN office to ask to be sure. My GYN told me to use hydrocortisone in the vagina itself if I thought I had a yeast infection. Or to just go ahead and use an OTC yeast medication.
TwoXChromosomes X I gave up and went back to Instead cups because I found the Diva Cup hurt too much regardless of how I folded it or how much of the tip I cut off.
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, the most typical form of FGM is much less severe than male circumcision (or MGM, as it is an unnecessary cut into healthy flesh). If women are now protected (since only 1996!) against even having one drop of blood being drawn (which was the most common ritual) then how can we justify removing a large piece of skin from our boys (and if you look into it, intactivists are; across the board, not against necessary surgery nor against it being elective for 18+ men to decide for themselves... it's the babies and children who are not allowed to choose for themselves that they are trying to protect!)
BabyBumps X Well the blood is bright red but like I said, there's no pain. The color is what has me concerned. Also, the way I noticed it. I was taking a shower and when I looked down it looked like I was peeing blood but I wasn't peeing. It's been about two hours and the bleeding hasn't stopped but there still isn't any pain. I'm especially freaked out because my roommate is at work and my phone was disconnected last week so I can't call or go to the hospital until morning :\
TwoXChromosomes X I LOVE OB TAMPONS  BUt none of my friends will use them. Something about the no applicator (which I prefer. I now hate applicators).   I find that OB tampons are shorter and slightly thicker than other brands. I am a short girl and they are much more comfortable for me. Sometimes I am forced to use a tampax, which even when I insert fully feel like they are too long for my vagina.  I have slept with a tampon in before. I have worn them for 8 hours before (altho usually I need to change them much sooner). Never have had an issue.
TwoXChromosomes X Early Response tests are accurate up to 5 days before your period is due.  Definitely take a test.  Your symptoms sound much like mine did when I was first pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X The insertion wasn't so bad. It kinda just felt like slightly-worse-than normal period cramps. I used to say the pain was worth it...but here I am, all pregnant and stuff.
Parenting X Napped. Wife did the same. After the birthing, first feeding and bonding time I took over with our baby girl. She then got to sleep and all was well.   Just remember to let her have some rest :)
TwoXChromosomes X The pill is a bad option for a lot of reasons too, especially if you live an irregular lifestyle. I'm basically incapzble of taking antibiotics consistently for 10 days, let alone having to stress about not forgetting to take a pill every day for the next 20 years of my life.while technically it's supposed to be 98 percent effective, the pill is very susceptible to human error.  Also, hormones  There are IUD's that are completely hormone-free.  Basically, if done right, you don't have to worry about getting pregnant for 5 years.
TwoXChromosomes X There's more chance for error. An IUD can be badly placed or dislodged, but with the pill you can basically screw up 365 days a year.  Even if you use the pill perfectly, it has about the same risk margin as the IUD. But with the IUD you don't have to worry about it for years. Why make your life more difficult? I totally see why it's becoming more popular.
Parenting X 's clothes from here when they have a sale.  Inexpensive and some really unique stuff.  Some stuff is the same as you can get anywhere but other things are really unique.
TwoXChromosomes X My physician pretty well forced me to get my first pap smear at 21 (don't even get me started on that) even though I wasn't and had never been sexually active. I was a virgin and had never even been fingered. I endured the pain only to receive a letter in the mail from our provincial health system a few weeks later informing me that my pap smear results came back abnormal. Naturally I was fairly distraught and uncertain as to what this really meant. So back to the doctors I went very nervous for a follow up. Turns out this letter stating that my smear was abnormal referred to the fact that my doctor had not done the slide well enough and they couldn't see any cells to do that testing... Why am I giving you this whole story???  Be sure to find out what they mean by abnormal.
Parenting X Not only because they get less sleep, but because it is more work. You body is PRODUCING nutrients to feed your child.Also, The mom must ensure the baby has a proper latch and is getting enough nourishment. this takes time and effort on Mom's part.   I both breastfed and formula fed my children. Breastfeeding is alot of work. Most people do not understand that!!! 
Parenting X Preemies are so cute! My son was 3 lbs 6 oz when he was born, and my husband and I started to look at regular-size newborns and think how funny-looking and fat they were. It looks like your twins have gotten strong and healthy since then -- congrats!
BabyBumps X You'll need the hospital pads for a little bit after you give birth.  You bleed A LOT.  I ended up getting an epidural and then pictocin because it slowed down my labor.  The epidural made it so I don't feel anything so the pictocin really didn't seem like a big deal at that point.  I would have rather had a tear than be cut but I know that they can be worse.  Luckily mine wasn't too bad.  I ended up wearing the clothes I planned to wear home while I was there because I got tired of wearing a hospital gown.  You may want to consider something comfortable to lounge in if you don't want to wear a hospital gown anymore.  Many people say that you don't really notice the placenta being delivered.  I felt it, it didn't hurt, more or less just felt weird.  Mine came out really fast (like 5 minutes after the baby) so it surprised the doctor since they usually take a little big longer.    I would say having them break my water was weirder than the placenta.  
TwoXChromosomes X You might have HPV, but it's not as serious as you're making it out to be (in most cases). I had an abnormal pap smear a couple months ago, and had to get a colposcopy. I was scared of the colposcopy (which wasn't that bad), and about the possibility of having HPV (which I do) until I did some research and talked with my doctor. I have to get a pap smear in a few months and basically keep track of it to make sure it doesn't develop/get worse. 90% of the time, the immune system will clear up HPV by itself within two years. Tell your partner-but don't stress. [Educate yourself]( -hpv.htm) and be sure to ask your doctor any questions you have.
TwoXChromosomes X Other forms of birthcontrol can apply hormones topically, meaning you get them in a much lower doses (which means she may have less problems with the side effects). The nuvaring or an IUD would be something that comes to mind.    She could also get a nonhormonal IUD (it's made of copper). If she is interested in what her options are, I'm sure her family doctor can advise her on what would work. 
TwoXChromosomes X I experienced a similiar month when I first started the pill. I called my Gyn who said to skip the filler pills and just continue taking the real bc pills and that should stop the period. It worked and every month after that has been better.
BabyBumps X It's normal for symptoms to come and go. Some days my breasts were super sensitive, the next day it was gone...nausea would also come and go. When I searched google, it wasn't very positive, a decline in symptoms linked to a missed miscarriage...I started freaking out (of course). Baby was doing great and I'm 38 weeks pregnant now...  If you are worried, I would just go to the emergency and ask for an ultrasound. Also, you can rent or buy a doppler and try to find baby's heart beat but at 9 weeks it's early for some dopplers (couldn't hear my baby's heartbeat until 13 weeks).   For now, I would really not tell the family in law, I know it's tempting and everything but wait until a least the first trimester to be over. It's really not fun to have to tell them that you miscarried...  Good luck
TwoXChromosomes X Don't gussle water and then take the tests. Drink normally and wait 5 at least 5 hours to take a new one. Better yet try with your first morning urine tommorow.  If you are having an issue peeing on the stick, pee in a cup and dip it for the amount of time in the instructions. If you still have a hard time reading them go buy digital tests. They clearly say Pregnant or Not Pregnant.   You are likely pregnant since you got a postive on one. It's much harder to get a false postive than a false negitive. Good luck!
BabyBumps X It made my wife more comfortable... once we were able to pick it up (I might have ordered the doppler a few weeks early, in retrospect). For a while there she was worrying, "Is baby still growing?", and finding the heartbeat with the doppler put her at ease.  Your milage may vary.
TwoXChromosomes X life is the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death - an embryo has all these things; he or she is growing constantly, his cells are reproducing rapidly, his little systems functioning at full capacity getting him ready for everything life has to offer him. Even at as little as 6 weeks he has little eyes and limb formations - telling yourself that he isn't "alive" just because his brain tissue hasn't developed yet is just something to make yourself feel better about what you are going to do to him - end his little baby life. Just because you think you had a better idea of how your life was going to go doesn't mean its ok to kill off a child made out of love because his existence isn't convenient for you at the time. abortion for medical necessity is one thing, abortion because you're worried about the life you could give him - im just at a loss for words how nuts that is. Rationalizing away your fears doesn't change the fact that this little "parasite" as you called him is really a little living piece of you and Taylor. I pass our local clinic all the time - the most common sign I see outside is "I killed my baby, and I regret it" no bible thumper's jesus message could touch that statement.
Parenting X Not exactly what you asked, but related information I wish someone had told me:  1. **Get only the slowest flow nipple** of whatever you choose.  I actually didn't know there were different speed options the first time I bought bottles &amp; nipples.  They're listed in the store with recommended ages - so the older the baby, the faster you can have the flow (larger hole).  However, if you're breastfeeding, all you ever need is the slowest flow.  That's it.  Your 9-mo-old will still drink out of newborn hole nipples and will suck it down super fast.  2. **You don't need the 8oz bottles** or anything larger unless you're planning to formula feed.  4oz bottles or 5oz bottles are plenty.  Again, doesn't matter how old your baby gets.  Breastfed babies eat 2-3oz per feeding.  Even when they're older, they don't drink more because the composition of breastmilk changes so the quantity stays about the same.  Formula fed babies will be drinking more and more and more and having 8 or 10oz bottles, but that's something you'll never use if you're breastfeeding.  I wish I'd have known. I bought 2 4oz bottles and 6 8oz bottles (thinking I could use the 8oz bottles to hold less in the beginning).  Yeah, I ended up buying more 4oz bottles later.  My son never had more than 3oz in a feeding (okay, except in the beginning couple months when I didn't know what I was doing and we overfed him a couple times, oops) and he was 30 pounds by the time he was 12 months old!  
TwoXChromosomes X Good advice about the angle. But please also consider the fact that most cotton tampons are bleached and may have other weird things in them. Even though they're 'safe' most of the time, in certain people they can cause discomfort or strange reactions. Good for you for getting a diva cup! I haven't used tampons in 4 years, and I'd really like to get something more ecologically friendly than disposable pads (which also have funky ingredients in them, especially scented ones.) I mean really, do I need to smell amazing on my period? I'm the only one down there that week anyway.  Regardless of how "safe" something is marketed as, or how much research it has, *you* know what you are comfortable putting into your body, or near such a sensitive area.
Parenting X More on quantity: It's normal for infants to "cluster feed" in the afternoon/evening for a few hours where they will nurse and nurse and nurse.  It's not because they're starving and need more food. It's because they need to be near mama, they want comfort, they want warmth, and they have a high need to suck.  All of this is good for your milk supply.  Newborns can't control quantity from a bottle. The bottle nipple goes in their mouth.  So they suck, because their instinct to suck is triggered (even if they're NOT hungry).  The bottle drips milk into their mouth without effort at all... so their mouth fills with milk.  They don't have much head/body control, and now a mouth full of milk. So they swallow it.  Then more milk comes, etc.  It's very easy to overfeed a young infant from a bottle.    At the breast, a baby can suck to extract milk when he is hungry.  If he just wants to suck, he can suck differently and not get any milk, but get his sucking need fulfilled.  If he's thirsty but not hungry, he can pull out just the watery foremilk and get a drink without getting much more.  If he's having a growth spurt, he can nurse and get more fat to fuel his growth and development.  It's a custom meal.  A bottle (even a bottle containing expressed breastmilk) cannot do that.  This article talks about normal newborn behavior and why breastfeeding isn't just about food: _%20newborn.htm
TwoXChromosomes X I have ALWAYS had an issue with the Always brand and also any brand with some sort of "Dry Max" or super absorbancy treatment. (For a while I actually thought my lady garden was allergic to blood!) I must stick with the basics when I do venture to the drug store.  I've now switched to Diva Cup and cloth pads and my week-ish is much more pleasant. 
BabyBumps X I went into labor naturally, but didn't know I was in labor.   I was 41 weeks and went into the hospital for a 'stress test' (my OB didn't want me going over 40 weeks but agreed to it if I'd go in for a stress test twice a week) and while I was there, they checked me and I was 5cm.  So they wouldn't let me leave!  So I wasn't able to wait until I was far along to go to the hospital, as I'd planned. :( I progressed quickly, more than 1cm/hour and I wasn't in pain until they insisted on strapping me down on my back in bed. At that point, I was 8cm, and then I stalled at 8cm for a few hours because I was so uncomfortable.  At that point I caved and asked for an epidural - which I didn't want.   They gave me the epidural, but it didn't work.  Apparently it doesn't work for everyone. :)  The anesthesiologist said my vertebra were too close together, so he couldn't get it down.  I could still feel everything and move and it did nothing for my pain.  My labor did stall out, or at least that's what they told me - they're in a hurry with births.  So then they gave me pitocin. My baby was born 5 hours after I walked into the hospital (not thinking I was in labor).  I would've known I was in labor by 6 or 7 cm for sure, though.  It got more obvious. ;)  Relaxing through the contractions totally worked, though!   They also, without telling me or asking me, put in a pressure cathetor and stuck some... something... on my son's scalp before he was born, which left scarring on his head for over a year.    I only feel lucky that I didn't get a c-section.  The interventions and pressure started the minute they sent me to labor &amp; delivery.  Luckily women in my family tend to birth quickly. I also feel lucky that my epidural didn't work.  It wasn't what I'd wanted.  They'd been pressuring me to get one since I first arrived - even though I wasn't in pain when I arrived.    They also send somebody in to drill me with questions about my medical history - while I was in intense labor!  On and on and on with the questions.  I pre-registered to deliver in the hospital - why wouldn't they have asked the majority of those things at that time rather than when I was trying to focus &amp; relax?    I was really unhappy with the hospital, but glad I was able to experience and feel birth.  The pushing part was amazing.  It was also the part that had scared me the most beforehand.  It felt so good to push.  I wasn't expecting that.  The contractions are what hurt - especially if you're not relaxing.  The urge to push was strong, and when I pushed it felt wonderful.  It was also pretty amazing that I could feel my son descending and feel his head and then body coming out.  I guess I didn't realize I'd be so aware of everything, and I sure didn't expect it to feel good pushing out an 8 pound baby. :)
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, that's easily the worst part about it.  I have a bag, it almost looks like a small pencil case (remember those from grade school?  haha) that I got at H&amp;M a few years ago.  it's some kind of plasticy/cloth hybrid so it is water proof and easy to wash and no smells escape it.  When I'm working or whatever, I use the inserts so I can just swap them out.    But like I said up above, I use the lunapads as a backup to the diva cup or when I'm too lazy to use the divacup, so I don't have THAT much experience with solely relying on reusable pads.  I've done it (this pad period I had I only used reusable pads) but if I were going to be at work all day I'd most likely be using the divacup as well.
TwoXChromosomes X I do know those pains that tend to be "one sided" (quite literally lol) are because of the side in which you ovulate. If you ovulated on your left side that month, then period cramps are going to be more to your left due to your ovulation. They're supposed to switch every month, but personally it's like....oww my left. next month.....general ow.....next month....ugh left again....where's the right?! I would assume then, that I have cysts on the left.  IDK about being prone to cyst elsewhere. My mom had one on her face when she was 16, but has had TERRIBLE cysts her entire life on her ovaries. Personally, I have random pains in my breasts, and my labial area, but all the doctors say it's nothing to worry about (mind you, only from what they hear, not many have checked themselves, and none that have say otherwise.)
Parenting X I think this is why so many mothers get upset when other mothers who *want to breastfeed* are told to supplement when it doesn't seem medically necessary.  Many babies won't take the breast after having a single bottle.  I've had friends go for weeks with lactation specialists and who really feel like terrible moms because their babies won't latch to their breast after getting a bottle.  Unless a baby legitimately needs that bottle, it shouldn't be given in the first place.  Doctors, hospitals, nurses and mothers should know that it increases the likelihood that a baby will stop nursing.
BabyBumps X It depends on how regular her cycle is. Mine has never been regular, so it was never a concern for me to go a couple of months with no period. I would say if I had been regular, at about 2 weeks of being late, I would grow concern and want to talk to a doctor. 
BabyBumps X Even if you hit the "bullseye" each month, there's still only a 25% chance of implantation. Keep that in mind when you're ttc. If she doesn't have a regular cycle, she may not be pregnant, but her period might still be late. I wasn't regular at all, and I would go for months at a time without a period, which makes for some really nerve-wrecking waits when ttc. Good luck! 
BabyBumps X "They" say to see a doctor if after 60 days there's no period and no positive HPT.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never used yogurt in *that* way.. but eating a shit ton of it will replenish the levels of bacteria necessary to keep your bits (and intestines) healthy.   I've had friends swear by the use of a peeled garlic clove up there, though. 
TwoXChromosomes X Chronic yeast infection sufferer here- I've tried it. It makes it feel better for a little while but it doesn't cure it. Meds are the only thing that cure it for me, I've tried all kinds of home remedies.  If anyone's interested in trying this remember that it MUST be plain yogurt! Flavored yogurt will only make it worse because it feeds off of the sugar.
BabyBumps X For example: my pre-ovulation temp is between 97.4 - 97.9   When I ovulate. It typically jumps to 98.5 - 99.0 and stays until the day my period starts.   You would definitely need a decent thermometer to track it since it's not the biggest change typically. 
TwoXChromosomes X Don't know how or why it works... something to do with the live cultures in the yogurt, but it worked for me. I just slathered copious amounts of it on and in my hoo hah and slapped on a pad. It was instantly soothing (chilled yogurt FTW). After repeated applications I found relief.
TwoXChromosomes X It's about the pH, and also helpful bacteria, fighting off the bad ones. I don't know, but I've tried it and it works for mild infections. Kinda messy, though.   Monistat isn't THAT expensive, and tends to work better, plus it comes with that tube of magic anti-itch stuff.  Another cure I haven't used, but which many women swear by, is a clove of garlic. You take the papery skin off, then tie it to a string (or unwaxed dental floss) and insert it. I guess worst-case scenario it's not going to do any harm, but I draw the line there.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had a diva cup since freshman year of college, over 7 years now.  I hated pads and had leakage issues with tampons. I was constantly in the bathroom and ruining sheets at night. I hated the smelly waste, and was concerned about the bleaching/unnatural materials.  No smell, no trash, very few leaks. I hated how dry tampons felt, I could always feel them. The cup I can't feel once it's in. I feel confident swimming and being more active than I ever did with tampons. I feel cleaner.  So much money saved. 30 bucks, 7 years ago. No signs of wear. I would have spent hundreds on traditional products in that time.  It really changed my life. I still have to deal with pms and cramps but the whole bleeding logistics thing is not something I have to give much thought to, and it used to be a constant concern.  It's definitely worth trying.
TwoXChromosomes X Boric acid capsules (you fill gelatin caps with drug store boric acid powder) work better.  When Monistat was prescription only, this saved a lot of women a lot of money.  They still work just fine.
TwoXChromosomes X I *llooovveeeee* my [Lady Cup]( ) (European brand which I prefer and recommend over Diva Cup).  I used to get some leakage with tampons but I don't have the same problem with cups. Also, I *never* feel the cup inside me and I used to sometimes feel tampons depending on how rushed my placement was.  I don't have to worry about carrying tampons/pads/liners with me OR running out of them and having to run down to the store on a surprise (read: I forgot I was due) period. For me this means I can put my cup in and go out on the town, or go camping, or go to the beach, or *anything* and I don't have to bring spares with me. I just find a cubicle or patch of bush somewhere, take out the cup, empty the cup and put the cup back in. This is especially amazing when drinking. Absolutely no need to try and squeeze tampons into those tiny, tiny purses we insist on taking with us.  But the best, best, *best* thing is no need for pads. I do not use them. Ever. My cup can stay in for 12 hours which means overnight baby!! If I sleep in in the morning I don't even need to change it before work, I can do it when I get there and don't have to worry about it.  Oh, and my boyfriend can go down on me with it in and not have to worry about leakage or a strange little string hanging out of me. Win.  If you need more convincing in a particular area hit me up, I'm quite sure cups have zero downsides so I can accommodate any questions :P
Parenting X Just curious... What was your reason for not breastfeeding at all? It seems like most moms at least choose to feed their babies colostrum.  How did you handle your milk coming in? Did you need to pump at all to relieve the engorgement? If so, what happened to that milk?  I have a friend who did the same, but without the anonymity of the internet I can't ask her these questions.
BabyBumps X You can most certainly worry and then you ovulate late which creates the illusion that your period comes late.   Your luteal phase doesn't change in length from month to month like the time between period and ovulation can. If it fluctuates it is only a days difference usually no more. Your LP is also a great indicator of why some people have trouble conceiving, too short of an LP and your body isn't giving an egg enough time to implant and get cozy.   The idea isn't completely incorrect; you just worry different parts late.   The only times my LP have been different in length is if I have had uterine surgery or if I experienced a 'chemical' pregnancy. Other than that it is the same every month usually 11/12 days long.   
TwoXChromosomes X if putting straight up yogurt in your crotch weirds you out - go to a health food store and get your hands on capsules of acidophilis. put two directly into your vagina. they break open (the gelatin from the capsule dissolves completely) and problem solved. you can repeat the process if necessary, but Ive never had to.   when youre broke its amazing, you dont have to spends 20 bucks on a reliable infection set, AND you can take the rest of the capsules orally from then on out to prevent future yeast infections. 
TwoXChromosomes X You should maybe do some research into how the pill works so you understand it better and why you should take it as prescribed.  It stops you from ovulating, so yes, if you don't start taking the pill till after the point in your cycle when you've already ovulated, then you could be pregnant. I'd say make a choice - be on the pill or use another form of BC but doing it the way you're doing it makes no sense at all. No wonder you're freaking out. 
TwoXChromosomes X It could be due to retroverted uterus. It's pretty normal and can be diagnosed from a pelvic exam or ultrasound. _uterus
TwoXChromosomes X How come your thyroid isnt under control? Are you seeing your doctor regularly? What type of medication are you taking?  I've been taking synthroid(.122) for years and have been on many different types of birth control and it has never affected it in anyway.  Your doctor should know what BC will work best with your thyroid disorder imo. I think you should work on stabilizing your thyroid before testing out the bc if you're worried about it, especially if you experience hyper and hypo thyroidism.. but just remember, its better to be too low than too high, you can always take medicine to bring it up, but its a lot more of an ordeal if its too high.
TwoXChromosomes X I have medium in both soft (loop stem) and regular (no stem), and small in regular (loop stem). I don't recommend the stemless, and don't actually use it that often.  I only get leaks if i put them in in a hurry and don't get a proper seal.
BabyBumps X I did attend but I dropped out. My milk supply is so low and I tried everything. LLL added more guilt. It's so hard.
TwoXChromosomes X Can you feel your strings? Are you spotting or going to start a period soon? Sometimes cramping can be a sign that you're expelling your IUD from what I hear, but cramping after sex I also think is normal to a certain extent, especially if it's a bit rougher then usual ;)
Parenting X It happened to me around the same time and I had a perfectly healthy and easy pregnancy, it is scary but more than likely not a sign of anything wrong-just her body making room for the little one. Congratulations!
TwoXChromosomes X Don't do it! That's one you'd need to talk to an OB about as it might have negative consequences (or, you know, burn). I do know that there is a home remedy for that kind of thing that involves putting yogurt inside. Good bacteria and such (I think you can google this one easily). I do believe that it not only restores good cultures, but helps with pH as well (I won't swear to the pH thing, this is from memory). Mine told me about it last year. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 21 and mine is doing this. I got hormone tests and everything came back normal. I didn't have a period for about 5 months. Got it last month, and it hasn't shown back up this month :/. They attributed it to weight loss (I lost 5 pounds...MAYBE). I guess even small amounts can fuck with you but idk.
TwoXChromosomes X Def. check with your doctor.  At least you have a period every month! Mine only comes every...2-3 months, usually, but it's fairly regular at least.
TwoXChromosomes X medical student here. with most of the other advice, definitely see your PCP or OB/GYN if you have one.   two things it could be, given the limited history:  -have you noticed associated acne or weight gain? do you have a family history of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome? if so, you might have PCOS, which causes the changes mentioned. You should know while this is not a great condition cosmetically (with hair growth and acne being side effects), it's not typically life-threatening but can lead to problems down the road if uncontrolled.  -you could also have the beginning stages of amenorrhea secondary to weight loss or stress. grad school can be quite stressful, and with lack of sleep, eating less, and weight loss, your periods could be spacing out. typically this is easily correctable by lifestyle changes (unfortunately, a challenge in grad school).  hopefully you get some answers from your doctor!
BabyBumps X Your doctor should be able to determine more closely how far along you are by ultrasounds. I just had my first one last week and the technician said that they weren't going to change my due date because the measurements of arms, legs, leg-to-butt, and head matched up with how far along I was (15 weeks). If your doctor thinks it's time, there's a really good chance s/he thinks you're on target.
BabyBumps X A lot can go wrong, but there is very little that can be done.  That is why most docs want to wait a bit before you come in.  If the pain on your side becomes severe or you experience bright red bleeding, you should call the doctor's office and they will likely want to get you in for an ultrasound at that point.
BabyBumps X Congratulations!  I think the first appointment being around 8 weeks is pretty typical.  My midwife wouldn't see me until 8 weeks as well.  It counts from the first day of your last period.  She had told me that unfortunately if something is going to happen that early in the pregnancy there is not much medical intervention that could be done anyways.  My midwife was not planning to give me an ultrasound at all until the big 20 week analysis.  My uterus was measuring quite large at 14 weeks though, so they gave me one to make sure I wasn't carrying twins.  I would imagine that if ectopic pregnancy is a concern they would give you one earlier, but I'm no medical professional.  Have you told your doctor that you are experiencing this cramping?  Perhaps they will get you in sooner than 8 weeks if they are aware of this.  Try not to stress too much about it though.  I had really bad cramping for the first few months and was told it was completely normal.  Best of luck to you!
BabyBumps X Only early first trimester ultrasounds are accurate for dating purposes - and even those are +/- 1 week.  Ultrasounds done in the third trimester are +/- 3 weeks.   They're really not super accurate in estimating baby's size or gestation.
TwoXChromosomes X You mentioned bad skin and facial hair. Have you been checked for PCOS? That can cause all sorts of crazy hormonal issues that you might want to see an endocrinologist for.
Parenting X Very true. A lot of moms w/ epis say they had an instabond. Some with natural births said it took them time. It varies depending on mom. Some wish they had gotten an epi, some wish they hadn't.   I don't need/want an epidural, so I don't get one. If I ever felt the need, I would.   Birth trauma probably plays more of a role in bonding issues than "was an epi used?" Choose a supportive caregiver and a good birth environment.
BabyBumps X Although I don't think membrane stripping should be done routinely, I would absolutely get it done if facing an induction.  I had mine stripped a few days before my induction and though I didn't end up in labor it got me a painless 2.5 cm further along.  I've already decided that this time I will ask to have mine stripped at 41 weeks if I don't have a baby yet.
Parenting X We're switching to a birth center in a few weeks. I'm so glad we have one available for this birth. Question - how long were you guys at the center? Ours says you can't be there longer than 23 hours so if you're in early labor they have to send you home or elsewhere for a bit. 
Parenting X Congrats!! I wanted a natural birth so, so badly..got a doula, took hypnobirthing classes, talked a lot of shit, and wound up going 2 weeks past my due date, getting induced, and getting a c/section after 3 days of labor.  I hope with all my heart that the next one is a natural VBAC. 
TwoXChromosomes X Can you get an early period while on the pill? I've never been on it but it's always been my understanding that you can't ever even start to bleed until you start the sugar pills...
BabyBumps X Everyone is different, and you worrying about what type of mom you'll be and if she's "inherit" some not best traits, already shows what an amazing mom you're going to be. She was unplanned, this is your first baby-- of course it's going to take a while for everything to sink in. Your world is about to do a 180 on you. I got pregnant at 19, unplanned and was terrified. Now, I'm going to be 100% honest. I only started getting excited at around 35/6 weeks, but that's because we were going with an adoption plan until then. When my daughter came I didn't get that initial "omg I'm in love!" It took me a while. Everything felt surreal, like I was in a dream. I couldn't believe this little thing placed in my arms was given to me to take care for. She turned 13 months yesterday and she is the most amazing thing that has ever been a part of my life. I just cry thinking about the amount of love I have towards her. I can stare at her for hours, it's crazy! But you can/will get there :) Everyone is different and gets there at their own time. 
BabyBumps X I'm not a worrier either, but this is just incredible and hard to fathom what is happening. I look at my daughter and can't believe a year ago, she was so tiny growing inside of me that we couldn't even see her.  The first few weeks after the baby is born is a little hectic but it became very routine, normal and natural for me. I'm sure it'll be that way for you. I'm of the camp that pregnancy is harder than having a baby even though I had an easy pregnancy (- maybe I have an easy baby too!).
TwoXChromosomes X It's not like the body keeps building and building lining -- to the contrary, BC causes the uterus *not* to build a lining in the first place. So there's not really anything to lose.  Plus, the periods you get while on BC are not true periods (because there is no real lining), but "withdraw bleeds". 
TwoXChromosomes X He might be knocking against the cervix a bit.  Doggie is a deep penetration position, and the cervix can sometimes bleed if it gets irritated.  Your best bet is to have someone check you out just in case though.
TwoXChromosomes X This has happened to me before--my ex was really well-endowed and doggy style ripped me up (oh god, eew) a couple of times.  No worries--it happens.  Just make sure that if you feel dry or uncomfortable that you either switch positions or use some lube.
TwoXChromosomes X AZO, cranberry juice, and tons of water will only help with the symptoms. They might help with the discomfort now, but an untreated UTI can result in a kidney infection. Call your health center again and tell them the situation or see if they can refer you to a nearby clinic. I don't think you should wait a month for treatment.  Edit: Once you've gotten rid of it, cranberry juice, proper hydration, and peeing after sex can help prevent you from getting another one.
TwoXChromosomes X Birth control pill isn't mandatory, no worries- just that you have birth control METHODS in place. So you can have abstinence and condoms, or condoms and some other non birth control pill.   And birth control pills actually improved my hormonal acne as a teen, which was nice. Didn't take care of the cysts, but at least the zits and little baby stuff disappeared.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had really good luck with ASOS Curve. The clothes are pricier, but I shop the sales.  Thrilled with the quality, and the dresses fit my curves very well. 
BabyBumps X Hypnobabies is different than Hypnobirthing. We discussed several physical coping techniques and practiced laboring and pushing positions, but the focus was the self-hypnosis which you practice 30 minutes per day every day until the birth. They also teach partners how to support mom (when, if, and how she needs it). My birth was mostly pain-free until the point of transition when I lost my focus. I have friends who took the class and had truly pain-free births... hopefully I can focus better next time and have the same results. But I loved the class and I'm convinced it was essential to my awesome birth experience. 
TwoXChromosomes X Good news!  Also, even if the pre-cancerous cells continue to be a problem, the procedure to remove them is pretty tolerable.  I had a LEEP done to get rid of my pre-cancerous cervical cells and everything is fine now.  Good luck to you!
TwoXChromosomes X Sears, Macy's, Nordstrom's, Target, Forever 21, Old Navy, and many other stores all have plus sizes. I didn't realize you needed you own special plus size *store* to be able to buy plus-sized clothing.
Parenting X Yes you are. You keep crapping on about how they're uneducated about childbirth and are doing thing that should "only be reserved for emergencies". You can't get much more judgemental.  Believe it or not, some women can know ALL the facts, have hours upon hours of childbirth classes, have a midwife and a doula, and still choose an epidural.
TwoXChromosomes X Nope, but I do hope that it progresses the way you want it to. My Mom wanted natural, but I turned around on her and she needed a c-section. I hope that your little one follows your ideal plan :)
BabyBumps X I started getting Braxton hicks at 14 weeks. It freaked me out so I asked my midwife. She said they actually start around six weeks, but it takes a while to feel them, because at the begining your uterus is so small. As second timers, we feel them earlier then first time moms too, because our bodies are more experience in producing them, and detecting them.  So yeah, you are fine. And when you orgasm, you get a bh too, but there is nothing wrong, and you aren't hurting the baby, so just enjoy it!!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;but my main concern in his position would have been that just as easily could have been something non-treatable.  Then he should be responsible and use condoms. Non monogamous sexual relationships come with risks. We're all responsible to protect ourselves.
TwoXChromosomes X If it's too much, you'll definitely know. A lot of what you might think are clots might just be uterine lining, which is no big deal. Everyone's different, but the only time you should start being concerned is if you become lightheaded or dizzy during periods of excessive (like, a fuckload) bleeding. Or if your period lasts longer than it does usually and the bleeding doesn't start dying down. It'll most likely be super obvious if there's an actual problem.
TwoXChromosomes X I just wanted to tell you that I am so sorry for your loss. Hopefully, you have an answer by now, but my OBGYN told me it could take 3 months to get your period after a miscarriage. It took me about 6 weeks to get my first period after my early loss.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you ever had "ninja periods"? The kind that starts just when you don't expect it? Like, it's a little early than normal, or at the start of the day there's nothing that tells you "you're going to start bleeding soooooon...." and then in the middle of the day SPLAT, your panties are all red?   I've had some of those. Very uncommon, but they happen. And obviously, I'm not wearing any "protection" haha.
Parenting X I know you said after 35, but if it helps, my mom had me when she was 35 and I'm pretty healthy. Only issue I know of so far is that I have mild IBS (nothing lifestyle changing, just a little annoying at times) which may have been passed on through her having ulcerative colitis.
TwoXChromosomes X Sweden offers 1 year and 4 months of **paid** maternity leave. The father gets a minimum of 2 months leave also.            I have just moved to Sweden, and I can confirm that it is an awesome country.
BabyBumps X I did my triple screen for both my pregnancies. There's no use in waiting around to know if baby is alright. I would rather know for myself. Even if they did find a chance of Down's, I would opt for more tests. My friend took the triple screen and she had a high risk, then had an amniocentesis done, and he baby was alright. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.
BabyBumps X I'm almost 11 weeks and if the triple test is the same as the "first trimester screening" as my doctor has referred to it, I've already scheduled the appointment for when i'm at 12 weeks. They said it could only be done from 11-14 weeks, but I'm not having the amniocentesis which they said I could have done at this time as well. Like others are saying, even if you're not planning on terminating the pregnancy, you'll have time to prepare and research if a problem does arise. I'm taking every chance I get to have them check whatever they need.. as long as it's not invasive or has an added risk of miscarriage. Pregnancy is full of such uncertainty, it's been driving me nuts! 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had a mirena put in around christmas time and I *love* it. I'm usually very sensitive to hormonal BC like the pill due to my depression. Fortunately the dosage in the mirena is so low and spread out over 5 years so it doesn't screw me around at all :)  My cramps *are* worse than before I got it, but I don't have a period anymore! I'll occasionally have spotting, but nothing bad enough to complain about.  Over 4 more years until I have to worry about babies! I'll probably get another one put in after that.
TwoXChromosomes X I'll tell you the truth then.  It does matter. I don't like big dicks, I don't like small dicks, but I sure as hell like the average.  It matters because big dicks hurt me, and little dicks are impossible to feel without some serious maneuvering. 
TwoXChromosomes X I got the Mirena inserted almost a month ago and I love it! The only issue I've had so far was that I cramped and spotted for a week, but I hear that's normal. No problems otherwise! I was on Yaz before and it was giving me the absolute worst migranes and stomach aches and made me miserable overall. Yay for not having to worry about kids until 2016! I recommend it to anyone. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm thinking of getting Implanon, an implant that goes in your arm. It's incredibly effective (rate of pregnancy is even lower than sterility procedures!). It has no estrogen, which is great for me. There are possible side effects, and irregular bleeding for the first few months is very common. Some women stop getting periods completely after a few months.
TwoXChromosomes X Relevant fact. We all start the same after we are conceived and hence the skin that forms the labia-minora in women is the same tissue that forms the penile skin in men ( with the glans being homological to the clitoris ).  Basically, reducing the inner labia is the female equivalent to circumcision (cutting off the foreskin ).   **EDIT:** Thought I should mention it since I drew the parallel to circumcision. This is not to be confused with the female genital mutilation that is practiced in some African cultures. In contrast to circumcision and labiaplasty, female genital mutilation typically involves completely cutting off the most erogenous parts of the vulva, including the inner labia as well as the clitoral glans, and sometimes even sewing the labia together in order to deliberately make intercourse painful and difficult for the woman. It's truly quite horrific. Western surgeons have had some success in creating a new clitoral glans for women that have fallen victim to it , by moving the part of the clitoris that is found inside the body up to the surface, and using it to create a new clitoral glans, but it is obviously an imperfect treatment for something that should not be happening in the first place.   
TwoXChromosomes X I was diagnosed with HSV-1 when I was four years old through some fluke thing and have had it in my body ever since. I do get about 2-3 outbreaks a year, almost always stress related (but also prone if I get a cut or pimple around my mouth, which at my age is almost never). Never had it in the genital area though. As far as I know I've never transferred the virus to any of my partners (all male). I talked to my doctor about it and was told that the risk of transference is extremely low, but to stay away from oral sex or kissing if I'm having a flare up. I had no idea the rate of infections varied by gender. Thanks for the info.
Parenting X Do they still nurse, or are they formula fed?  If it's formula, they might be getting too much of it now.  I baby-sat a formula fed baby when he was about that age.  He had pooping problems, and the doctor told his mom that it's because he was getting way too much formula.  Talk to your doctor, but I don't think they're supposed to get more than 24 ounces of formula a day at that age.
Parenting X When the head of the NICU says that the cord being wrapped around the baby is causing it distress, I'm going to listen to her.
TwoXChromosomes X I love the depo! 99.9% chance of effectiveness- you get a shot in your arm once every 3 months- has worked for me for years. I'll forget the pill :( The patch is great but not covered by all insurances or carried by all dr's. 
Parenting X I have an incredibly high tolerance for pain, but that is irrelevant if you have to be induced. The contractions are many times more painful. I had no choice but to be induced, since my water broke and I hadn't progressed AT ALL after 12 hours of labor (still only 1 cm!). Even with induction, I still developed an infection 10 hours later and had to have an emergency c-section. The doctor actually said that the situation was so bad both for me and for my baby in distress, that he wasn't even giving me an option. He was visibly concerned.  There are lots if women out there who wanted natural births but couldn't for various reasons, and it's not because we're wimps who can't deal with the normal pain of childbirth.
TwoXChromosomes X I was holding out for the pool because I really felt like getting in there would make things progress fast enough that I wouldn't need it. I'm in Germany, and nitrous oxide/gas and air isn't offered as an option. They suggested chamomile tea as pain relief because there was already a lady labouring in the pool and it was likely to be several hours before she was done with it; I suggested they ram their chamomile teabags up their bottoms and get me a gigantic needle. I don't see how Pitocin, which increases the strength of the contractions and hence the pain, is just fine as an intervention but something that makes things bearable isn't.   Next time (and I would like there to be a next time) I definitely want a go in the pool though. I was amazed at how instinctive it was that I just felt like I wanted to be in the water. I had a shower but it was Not Good Enough.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah! That was my first guess too, but I don't feel itchy at all. The internet also says it should be white and clumpy and my discharge was yellow.
TwoXChromosomes X I had a few abnormal paps and then a colposcopy a few years ago. I was really, really nervous both about the abnormal pap and the colposcopy itself but the procedure was completely fine for me. The doctor didn't find anything abnormal to biopsy but I actually requested that he do it anyway, because I'm a worrywart.  I took a few advil beforehand but I don't think I needed them. Obviously every situation is different, but just know that I felt absolutely no pain. Everything came back fine and I've been having normal paps for years now.  You'll be okay =) This is so very common.
TwoXChromosomes X Not sure if I'm right, but sponges were the thing used in historical times, when there was no tampons and pads. So it's more about back to basics. I'd still recommend the cup to everyone instead. Not sure how safe I'd feel with a sponge.
BabyBumps X Sounds weird, but it could it be coming from your urethra? Sometimes I get a clear, watery fluid from my urethra randomly. It's the same stuff that gets produced when women are "Squirters" except it doesn't happen when I orgasm, it just comes out randomly sometimes :P. It's pretty watery and clear.
BabyBumps X I'm not saying that people that choose natural childbirth think they're superior. The satire of the article is that natural birth is very rare these days due to medical intervention/convenience and some women who didn't choose to have a c-section or didn't use an epidural think they made the morally better choice for their baby vs. their own comfort. 
TwoXChromosomes X I love OB. Mostly because I critfail every tampon insertion roll and some how manage to give myself a plastic / cardboard cut every freaking time I use something with an applicator.   When I am especially heavy I will also wear a panty liner with my tampons. Mostly because on a heavy day I bleed through in an hour or two and I can't always interrupt a client at work so that I can change my tampon. 
TwoXChromosomes X I wasn't able to watch the whole video, but each form of birth control (including various pills), all have their own set of side effects that effect each female differently. Low libido and other similar things can be a side effect of birth control.
BabyBumps X I didn't feel pregnant until about 6-7 weeks when the morning sickness started kicking in.  If you avoid that, there sometimes aren't a whole lot of symptoms until you start to show.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't know if you've considered alternative menstrual products, but it's possible that tampons just don't agree with you. I agree with karma-pudding, try OB. They're a little more personal to insert, but they're also super convenient to carry. I am an avid menstrual cup fan these days. My Diva Cup makes shark week SO much more bearable.
BabyBumps X I took 3 tests and all were positive. The only reason I took a test in the first place was because I take them routinely every few months and I had what felt like menstrual cramps for about 5 days, my period was only a couple of days late. I visited my nurse practitioner the next day and got an official positive, and she pointed me in the direction of a couple of good OBs.  I never "felt pregnant" either until I was quite a few weeks in and my only symptoms were occasional, spontaneous nausea and sleepiness. The at-home pregnancy tests are almost always right and a false-negative is much more likely to occur than a false-positive (and the generic brands are just as accurate as the expensive ones) so you're probably positive! Good luck and congrats :)
Parenting X My son was born prematurely and weighed 3lbs 14ozs.  3 days after he got to go home from the NICU he had a high fever.  He was only 2 weeks old.  They had to do a spinal puncture to check for meningitis.  Was the hardest decision to make.  He was so so tiny.  All turned out okay though.
TwoXChromosomes X I bought some U by Kotex pads once and really liked them, so that's my go-to pad brand at the moment.  I think I'll get a box of their tampons and a box of obs and see which I like.
BabyBumps X My period had been kind of irregular, so I kind of put it out of my mind. Until one day I was like "Well, I haven't had a period in a long time. Might as well take another test." Then I got the positive. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I'd definitely go for the IUD if you can't get the tubal yet. Depending on type, you're safe for 5-10 years and their effectiveness is the same as the pill, but minus the human error of forgetting to take it/it being neutralizes by other drugs etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a kiwi chick and we have the same brands of tampons as you guys across the ditch, Libra and Carefree, and I know that Libra do applicator tampons so you may just need to go and have another look at your supermarket?
BabyBumps X As someone who almost didn't have a healthy baby, I think you're misunderstanding what people mean.  A birth that does not result in a healthy baby is a disaster. A tragedy. Something that will take years to come to grips with, and will never be gotten over.  A birth that results in a healthy baby -- even if the birth experience isn't what you want -- is something you can overcome. Many women do not enjoy childbirth, or find it fulfilling, or will have something go wrong, but most of those women will recover and love their baby and forget about the birth. Your birth sounds much, much worse than most, but compared to having a not-healthy baby, surely it is relatively minor?  Because we cannot predict whether a birth will require intervention -- many women will need c-sections; many women will need pitocin; many women will need other help -- it is important that women go into childbirth cognizant of the fact that the childbirth may not go to plan. That does not mean that doctors or nurses should ignore the wishes of their patients; of course they should listen and try to accommodate mothers. But mothers must not build expectations that require the perfect birth in order for them to be happy.
TwoXChromosomes X I have thrown up and passed out from my cramps. Hurray from birth control! &lt;3 It fixes everything.  I will say, though, at least the initial pain only lasts for ten minutes. Cramps will be that painful, without faltering, for your entire period.
BabyBumps X My first test was negative, too. I took it as soon as the test box recommended doing so. Three days later there was still no period, so I took another and it was positive. Watch for veeeery faint lines. I think my first test may have actually been positive, but the line was so faint that I ignored it.
TwoXChromosomes X Ask your doctor for one with desogestrel as the progesterone, as this one has less side effects, as acne and break through bleeding (yes, some girls experience more, not less, acne after starting the pill..). It does have a slight higher risk for thromboembolism (blood clots), but as long as you're not in a high risk group (you're young and don't smoke(?)), they're safe. And anyway, the risk is still less than for a pregnant woman;)
BabyBumps X I'm in Canada so like others have said all mothers get 17 weeks of maternity (15 of those 17 weeks are compensated at 55% of salary up to a max of $468/week). Then the two parents decide how to split an additional 35 weeks of parental leave (with the same basic monetary compensation as above).   On top of that my employer offers a very generous "allowance", so while I am on maternity and/or parental leave they will provide me an allowance that adds to the standard benefits and tops me up to 93% my full salary. So basically I get a full year at full pay.   Contrast that with my previous child, who was born when I was a student in high school. I was allowed three weeks absence. I continued to attend school right up until the day before my daughter was born (which just happened to be a holiday) and returned three weeks later. It was very hard.   I have a lot of respect for the ladies in the US that return to work after six weeks. I hope some of our 'damn dirty socialism' from the North catches on down there and gives your babies the quality mom and dad time they deserve!
BabyBumps X Oh God my first trimester **sucked** and I know exactly how you feel. It does get better but during that time, I thought it would never end. I was sick all the time, couldn't eat any thing, and what I did eat would make me sick. My doc gave me a prescription for Zofran and wow it was a life saver. I've had to take it through a lot of my pregnancy (about a half a pill a day) but it really helped me eat and sleep. Once my 2nd trimester kicked in, I felt almost normal!! I'm just hungry all the time and have some trouble sleeping. I'm now 35 weeks and it's hard to believe I'm almost done! But no, pregnancy is not "great" and people who say it is must be lying! I'm pretty proud of myself for getting this far...I am sooo ready for it to be over with. You're not alone! And the moment you start feeling that way, just come back here on the internetz and you'll feel better :)
TwoXChromosomes X If you are concerned, you should talk to a doctor. Lots of things can effect your period, like stress, weight, exercise, hormones, diet.....
TwoXChromosomes X Congrats! Hope your cramps dissipate quickly (mine stayed for my first 3 weeks, but they're all gone now!)
Parenting X I think doctors are watching their asses.  Things aren't going smoothly, it's probably safer to get it out.  If anything happens to that baby, the parents will sue.  Probably trying to avoid that.    I will say though, natural birth is great, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't work out.  I wanted a natural birth, I ended up with a 9# 4 oz baby that I could not birth on my own.  I wish you luck!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I threw up everything from approximately week 11 onward with that pregnancy, it was awful.  Oh God. Me too. Nine months of hyperemesis. I even had Zofran running through my IV on the delivery table (and still threw up twice.) Good times. 
TwoXChromosomes X I used condoms with my ex for over 4 years straight as an only form of birth control and they worked very well for us. I later got an IUD but actually felt more secure and in control with the condoms.   When properly used condoms are very effective, so it's odd telling people who use them "why aren't you on birth control?". Condoms are actually probably the most widely available form on birth control, and to many the easiest, cheapest and with the least side effects.
Parenting X Our bill was 8K in Boston - but they did not even deliver the baby - we arrived at the hospital WITH the baby (who was healthy) - I had him in the car on the way there. So 8K for delivering the placenta, a couple of stitches, a bed to sleep in for two days, and a few meals. 
TwoXChromosomes X While I don't disagree that circumcision is genital mutilation, it is on a very different scale than female genital mutilation, not because it's male vs. female and this is a female-driven community, but because of the circumstances surrounding female genital mutilation and the consequences of it. I suggest looking up what happens on average to women who have their genitals mutilated and comparing it to the average circumcision recipient, and then tell me they are at all comparable.
TwoXChromosomes X Again, I'm not arguing that the principles in either case are preferable one way or the other, just that the execution and the severity of the consequences of each are vastly different. Circumcision is often done in a sterile environment to boys of a very young age and, though it carries the consequence of loss of stimulation, is more often than not almost entirely harmless otherwise. Female genital mutilation is none of those things. I'm not condoning circumcision, but it hardly compares in my opinion. A man with a circumcised penis can still fully function sexually and biologically, the same cannot be said for most women who have had genital mutilation.
Parenting X It can be a concern all people like but it's not a valid reason to legislate morality.  Why shouldn't that woman be allowed to abort male fetuses if she wants to?
TwoXChromosomes X Missing a period due to stress DOES happen, but you'll probably want to take a pregnancy test if your period doesn't show up soon.
TwoXChromosomes X See your doctor. It could be PCOS or in some cases, a pregnancy test would come up negative bc @ 12 weeks pregnant hCG levels may be too high to read on a home pregnancy test causing a false negative.
TwoXChromosomes X I would try to get into see your OBGYN or GP asap. It sounds like a miscarriage (I've had 6) and you need to make sure it was compleate. Left over tissue can cause infection and/or cause your body to still think it's pregnant.  If you are soaking a pad an hour, have a fever, have smelly discharge, develop shoulder pain, or feel faint go to the ER right away.
TwoXChromosomes X I am coming up on year 5 with my Mirena, no kids.   My procedure was awesome.  I only had pain when they were inserting it and no other complications or pain afterwards.  Two weeks later, I was having condom-free sex with no problems.  If you are nervous about it, just schedule a day off of work and let them know that there is a possibility that you will be able to make it in that day.  Same goes with the condoms, if you are already worrying about possible side effects, just use one to be on the safe side.    Lady fist-bump to you! Mirena is awesome!
TwoXChromosomes X They are not the same, but they are very similar actually. A baby is just a bunch of rapidly dividing cells that feed off of the mother... cancer is a bunch of rapidly dividing cells that also feeds off of the nutrients the mother ingests.
BabyBumps X Please keep in mind that the stress of thinking you are pregnant can also delay your period. This used to happen to me all the time in my twenties before I really wanted to get pregnant. I'm not going to tell you to relax and not worry about it, because I know that is not possible. But if you get another negative test or you finally get your period the day after the negative test, know that you are not alone in stressing yourself out about it. If you are still getting negatives and not starting, I would go get a blood test at Planned Parenthood so you can stop worrying either way. 
TwoXChromosomes X There are many different pill formulations, but from what I read skipping a day is not a major risk in most cases. They say to take it as soon as you remember, and take 2 if it's the next day.  See: -missed.html Also, I am not a doctor. You should probably talk to one of those. 
TwoXChromosomes X There are different degrees of vaginismus. The most severe degree prevents intercourse, whereas milder degrees cause pain and tightness even with successful penetration.   The exam should not have hurt at all, and she should have known that. In your next exam for your second opinion, tell the doctor what you are feeling during the exam, and rate your pain on a pain scale. I like [this one.]( )  Luckily, my GP (primary care physician) was very caring and knowledgeable, so referred me on to a urogynaecologist when we couldn't complete the exam due to pain and the closed muscle.  This article encouraged me to seek help in the first place: _ow_to_wow_demystifying_painful_intercourse  Now I am going through treatment and my homework largely follows the "end the pain" routine in ["Heal Pelvic Pain" by Amy Stein.]( )
TwoXChromosomes X 'Sexual harassment, is intimidation, bullying or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.'  Asking someone on a date/go out with them doesn't seem to be bullying, coercion of a sexual nature. There was no promise of rewards for sexual favours.  Maybe the OP is incredibly attractive and the doctor decided to ask her out on a date...   So how is it sexual harassment, I've checked the definition and it just appears to me that the OP is incredibly attractive and the Doctor wanted a date, it's slightly unprofessional. But if the exam went well and did abuse his power in that way I don't see the sexual harassment so englighten me.
TwoXChromosomes X It's been awhile since I read the package of BC pills, but I believe it says that if you miss a pill, to also use an alternate method of BC for the rest of the cycle.  Personally, I would take plan B just to be extra sure.
TwoXChromosomes X I can go a few hours on my heavy days (usually days 2 and 3 of 5 or 6)...  I can see how annoying it would be to go even shorter amounts of time!  But compared to tampons, I agree it is less uncomfortable.  When you have to insert and remove something that often...  The cup definitely feels nicer all around.
BabyBumps X Like others have mentioned, don't worry about it, I'm having baby #3 here in the UK, and they haven't weighed me once! That being said, I started out close to 150 lbs (5'5.5"), and I'm now at 28 weeks...haven't stepped on a scale in 3-4 weeks, but at 24-25 weeks I was only sitting around 132 lbs!   Yes, that is down 18 lbs!!!   I've been trying to eat a little more, but I'm not finding my eating habits any different than pre-pregnancy. For the record, I am a fairly healthy eater - lots of homecooking and balanced meals - meat, veggies and carbs. I'll be happy if I can break even weight-wise with this pregnancy, but let's face it - my 150 lbs pre-pregnancy weight didn't exactly make me skinny, so the way I see it, the baby is using up my reserves and if this was one of my first two pregnancies, this would be a healthy weight for me at this point.  Just make sure to take your vitamins - the baby will take everything it needs from you, so as long as you feel "healthy", just keep doing what you are doing.
TwoXChromosomes X You're not alone. Even their standard warming lube made my vag feel like it was on fire. I had to stop using Durex condoms for the same reasons :(
TwoXChromosomes X I'd dispute that "probably" and substitute a "maybe." I have periods that heavy and I much prefer the Diva cup to my other options. I find it much more comfortable than tampons, and once you get good with it it's just as easy. Not to mention not having to carry 5-10 tampons/pads if you're out of the house the whole day. 
TwoXChromosomes X Some of the points she mentioned weren't selfish at all. One of her points was that she is of the opinion that she doesn't want to bring an unwanted child into a rough life if she isn't prepared to care for it. If someone doesn't have the resources or capacity to care for a child it's unfair to bring one into the world.
TwoXChromosomes X Tampons are irritating because they dry you out, most commonly. Cups, because they are not absorbing anything, are also not absorbing the liquid in your vaginal cell walls (imagine how your  mouth would feel with cotton balls in it all day. That's how your vagina feels and why it is irritated by the end).  It's fine to sleep with - because it's inside of you it won't go anywhere far. Chances are that you're not sleeping upside-down, right?  You can buy them in stores, yes. Instead at the grocery/pharmacy, and silicone cups in health food and feminist stores.
TwoXChromosomes X Things luckily turned around for me once ze bf and I started using some standard Trojan lubricated condoms. No weird scents, no warming lube, no spermicide, NO BURN.
TwoXChromosomes X Are you using the smaller size? You may want to try the larger size, or even another cup with a higher capacity. The small Diva takes about 20ml, and there are a few out there that will hold up to 30ml. I'm a heavy bleeder myself and I use a larger cup on my heavy day (usually the second day). The larger cups will be just a few mm wider so it's not as scary as it might sound, especially if you've already got the insertion and removal down.   And yes, I bleed way over the average. I would be thrilled if I was even close to that.
BabyBumps X For me, labor comes about a week after the plug falls out.  Maybe it was 2 weeks...but it's not that long.  I also didn't dilate very much the first few times and still went into labor just fine.  They gave me pitocin to help the dilating along, and everything was fine.  It's the same thing that happened to my mom.    Good luck! :)
TwoXChromosomes X The active ingredient in most warming lube (except I don't see it listed on this KY Yours and Mine) is capsaicin. **Extract of chili.** For cooling lube, it's menthol.  Lubes that claim to do things can cause irritation in sensitive people. Glycol, parabens and glycerin can be troublesome too, all of which are present in one or both of these KY lubes.  I use Sliquid Natural because it is hypoallergenic. Yes! is a good choice too. Medical lubricant causes me to have splintery pain due to the glycol.  &gt;Ingredients  &gt;Yours For Him: Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Maltodextrin, Honey (miel), Methylparaben, Sucralose.   &gt;Mine For Her: Water (eau), Propylene Glycol, Polysorbate 60, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Benzoic Acid, Menthyl Lactate, Methyl Salicylate, Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Hydroxide.  His lube sounds like a recipe for a yeast infection (so many sugars) and her lube sounds like a recipe for pain (so many irritants).  *Edited for actual ingredients
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely trim! I use the FemmeCup (pretty much the same thing), and I have trimmed the stem completely off. I took a nail file to it to make it all smooth, so it doesn't look like there even was a stem to begin with and nothing pokes me. While the stem could make removal easier (I did not find this to be the case before I trimmed), you don't need it. I just kinda squeeze the cup from the bottom to remove, using one finger to kind of slide up and push on the rim to break the seal. Once you break the seal that it makes around your cervical opening, you can just slide it right out.   On the sitting thing: Could it be that the cup is too long? While most cups are pretty much the same in design, length/girth does differ by brand. For example, I got a FemmeCup (as opposed to the Diva) because I was told that it was a wee bit smaller around and shorter in length. Also, most cups come in more than one size. Usually they market the smaller one for women that have not had children, or younger women, and the larger one for older ladies or ladies that have given birth vaginally. Worth looking into :D  Another handy hint: Sometimes, no matter how hard I try, I just have an off moment with putting it in and it does not immediately sit in its best position. In this case, I find that if I lay down for a few minutes it sort of moves itself into the most comfortable position. This could just be me, but worth a shot if you have the time to try it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Have an upvote for spreading the word. I can't speak highly enough about menstrual cups. I don't think they're any grosser than pads or tampons, you just need to clean them or they *will* start to get gross. I've been using the same cup for 5+ years and I will never use anything else. Except another menstrual cup, if/when this one ever wears out.
BabyBumps X I didn't really gain until about 20 weeks, and I was at a "healthy" (average for my height) weight before I got pregnant. My doc wasn't worried, so I wasn't either. Definitely bring it up at your next appointment, but try not to stress out about it. Weight gain hits everyone differently. The pound a week is an average; for some people it comes gradually, for others all at once. 
TwoXChromosomes X late to the party, but:  &gt; One major unintended consequence of these regulations is that if Planned Parenthood clinics and other health clinics that provide abortions are forced to shut down, they will be taking all of their other services with them, such as affordable pap smears, breast exams and birth control for low-income men and women.  couldn't the PP clinics stay open and offer these services as long as they don't also offer abortions? there are like half a dozen PP clinics within 50 miles of me here in texas, but only one of them performs abortion services.
BabyBumps X I'm in the same situation.  I'm 20 weeks now, started a overweight, lost a little in first trimester, and haven't gained anything yet.  I talked with my Dr explaining my concerns she said that my weight is redistributing (I am def showing).  She says the weight will come soon and I shouldn't worry.
TwoXChromosomes X I've used pads since my first cycle and I have to say, I've never had what you are describing. They've never felt like skateboards (I get the thin ones that have wings), my period is supposed to smell however if you change it often enough you don't get that residual scent, and I've never noticed them. I don't think I've ever noticed them on any woman for that matter.   As for tampons, they kind of disgust me. The thought of sticking a cloth like material that can leave behind fluff in my vagina? Sorry, no. I'm not on board with having to remember to change them every 4 hours either. Oh and they are extremely uncomfortable to me.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, you guys could have torn something. Its pretty common. How much blood is 'quite a bit'? How long has it been bleeding for, and are you still bleeding? Is there anything besides blood? I.e. Any abdominal pain?
TwoXChromosomes X Honestly? My period is light enough that I can't wear tampons which is both a blessing and a curse. I love that it's super light and only 3ish days long but on the flip side it makes doing anything that requires tampons (swimming, etc) almost impossible. Even the lightest flow tampons are too much. I don't actually wear pads though either, I wear liners. 
TwoXChromosomes X Hair loss can be a sign of iron deficiency.. you should get checked out just to make sure it's not a symptom of a larger medical problem.
TwoXChromosomes X I've got polycystic ovarian syndrome. It makes my periods very infrequent but heavy, abnormal facial and body hair, and there have been studies about a link between PCOS and obesity. It's a pretty common disorder, and it sounds like that's what you have as well. It can be treated with shots or birth control pills, but I've also heard of it being controlled with Metformin, which is typically used to treat diabetes and insulin resistance.   Don't be scared. You're not alone. Also, I'm not getting any treatment for my PCOS right now because I've got my blood sugar under control. I know it's scary when the doctors say "You've got XYZ!" but I promise you it's not a big deal or the end of the world. I suggest you get tested for diabetes or insulin resistance, but those conditions are ALSO not the end of the world. You'll be fine, I promise. PM me if you need someone to talk to. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm really tempted to switch over, but considering I have such a heavy flow that I'm forced to use both pads and tampons simultaneously on occasion, how likely is it that a menstrual cup wouldn't actually leak as well? How often do you have to empty it?
TwoXChromosomes X I don't like tampons for regular use because I find them uncomfortable. Also, I have a pretty heavy flow so I have to change tampons very frequently so I don't have serious spillage. I use tampons for outfits that absolutely can't be changed(i.e I'm wearing some sort of evening gown or outfit for a special occasion and I can't wear a pad) but I find wearing pads a lot more comfortable for me. I can definitely smell the blood, but it's such a miserable time anyway so I just try to change my pads fairly frequently/supplement it with a little toilet paper.
TwoXChromosomes X VALTREX. other than that, abreva. Also, remember that when you have an outbreak, it is very possible to spread the virus to other regions of the body. For example, I have oral herpes outbreaks; my doctor told me never to fool around orally during an outbreak because it could spread and become genital herpes. Hearing or reading this sounds logical, but I hadn't thought of that until she told me, so just keep that in mind! 
TwoXChromosomes X I have the implanon in now have had it for a bit over a week.  used to have it 4 yrs ago and i too got some spotting the doc said if i want i can try some period pain killers (naprogesic dont know where u are but here in australia thats what we have) theres apparently a hormone in those pills that even out the hormones in ur body. I have spotting now and just started takeing the pills yesterday so ill give them a couple of days to work. 
TwoXChromosomes X I got my Implanon placed on June 15, two days after my period finished. July sucked because I bled for almost three weeks straight. Then I had 4 days off and bled for 2 more weeks. I called my gyno, but she said that it was totally normal. I skipped the last three weeks of August, which was amazing! I got a period two weeks ago and it only lasted one week, but three days later I got round 2 and it's finally waning. TL;DR: My gyno told me that Implanon effects everyone differently. What you're going through is probably normal.
TwoXChromosomes X The CDC estimates that "HPV is so common that at least 50% of sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives." -HPV.htm  Had it, cleared it. For you, they've caught it early enough that they won't let it develop into cancer.
Parenting X And you can guarantee that you'll always use a condom, and it will never break or slide off, and you will never have an unfaithful partner with whom you're having unprotected sex?
TwoXChromosomes X That's how old I am too, and I have a boyfriend who I've been with for 5 years. I don't even *know* what strain I have - it seems like a lot of doctors are being kind of slack when it comes to this. I got examined but have yet to received any further information. Am I supposed to wait for it to go away or develop into cervical cancer? All I really know is that my blood-work showed low levels of estrogen.
Parenting X &gt;Cutting off skin = cutting off skin and there's no way around that.  Absolutely, which is why I'm not sure why the procedure seems so difficult and involved medically when it really does just take a matter of seconds at a bris.  I've never witnessed a "medical" circumcision, but I've been at several bris ceremonies and it's damn quick.  Maybe our bigger Jew penises just make it easier....
TwoXChromosomes X I have HPV. I found out a few months ago. It's super common (according to my doctor and the internets) and usually clears up on its own within a couple years. I think people just don't like to talk about it because of the STD stigma. In reality, most sexually active people get it at some point.
Parenting X You have a rare condition, and that's why everyone should cut off their boy's foreskins?  Why not simply wait and then get the circumcision when they are older if they want to?  Make it the child's choice.
TwoXChromosomes X "Worst" is a relative term. Your doc is right that it's not something to freak out about. This strain is the one of the two strains that are most likely to develop into cancer *if left untreated.* As long as you keep getting your paps when they're scheduled, you do not have to worry about getting cancer. You may have to get a biopsy, and eventually if it does not clear on its own (MOST do), you'll have a procedure to kill off the top layer of cervix cells. I had cryotherapy. It wasn't the most pleasant, but you don't even need sedation at all. HPV is most common in young women, so you're unfortunately in the most vulnerable age bracket (actually, you're older than average). Your sex life is normal. Your partner may be a carrier, but since he doesn't have a cervix, he can't get cervical cancer! It would be very very very rare for him to have any issues or even ever know whether or not he has it.
Parenting X Hell fucking no, don't do it. I would rather lose a finger than my foreskin.   First up: it's not yours. It's his. Bodily integrity is a human right. Imposing cosmetic surgery on non-consenting infants is not.   Second, foreskins are awesome. Let me count the ways:  * Tens of thousands of nerve endings. That's an *astounding* amount of sensory bandwidth.  * Those nerve endings include a whole lot of sensitive stretch receptors - as the foreskin moves, it reports a whole lot of positional detail. That's a whole extra *kind* of sensation we're talking about.  * Frictionless gliding mechanism. The foreskin isn't just a "piece of skin", it's a toroidal linear bearing, providing *completely* frictionless movement, far superior to any amount of lubrication. Okay, break to explain this one:  Take a stretchy satin shirt, with the sleeves too long, about a hand-length past your fingertips. Put it on, turn the end of the sleeve in on itself, and glue the cuff to your watch strap. You now have a functional model of an intact penis. Your hand is the glans, the sleeve is the foreskin, your arm is the shaft.   Now grasp your sleeve, and extend your arm to look at your watch. The fabric *rolls* over your hand - it doesn't slide. There's no friction against your hand at all, because nothing slides over it.   Or take a pinch of eyelid/elbow/scrotum skin, and rub between thumb and finger. Again, no friction on your finger pads whatsoever, despite a firm grip. This is what we experience. We don't need lube to masturbate, because we have something far better built-in.   * Stimulation from friction **sucks** next to frictionless massaging. Intact guys have access to both - and while friction can be an interesting place to visit, none of us would ever want to live there. * The frenulum is known by some as the 'male clitoris', and is exquisitely sensitive. Even if it's preserved (it usually isn't), one of the things it's most sensitive to is stretching as the foreskin retracts. No foreskin, no stretching, you've just lost a vast amount of sexual pleasure.  * Because the foreskin has a vast number of nerve endings, the sensation it provides, while not necessarily more intense, has much higher bandwidth. Think copies of old audio cassettes, which went all muffly. No matter how loud you made them, you still couldn't make out the details. Or imagine caressing a breast with half your hand gone numb.  * The foreskin protects and moisturises the surface of the glans (which is an *internal organ*, and does not have skin), keeping it sensitive and supple. Men undergoing foreskin restoration report that the difference in sensation is akin to the difference between wearing a condom and going bareback.  * Because we don't rely on friction for stimulation, condoms don't suck *nearly* as much for us as they do for circumcised guys.   There are no good reasons to circumcise.   * Hygiene is not an issue. Five seconds in the shower, just pull back, wash, release, done. Washing your ears is harder work than that, but you don't go cutting those off.  * I daresay that there are lots of guys in the world that find intact female genitalia 'weird', too - but if someone suggested you should cut up your daughter to suit them, you'd punch them in the face. Think about that.  * In some places, the majority of girls are circumcised, too. If you went to live there, would you have your daughter circumcised so she would be "normal"?  Even if you wanted to, there's no good reason to do it early.   * It's his body, it ought to be his competent adult choice. You wouldn't give him a tattoo - or even let him get one himself - until he was an adult, so why this?  * Done as an adult (assuming he wanted to), there's vastly more margin for error, plus he could actually choose exactly how he wanted it done.  * In infancy, the foreskin is fused to the glans, like your nails are fused to the nail bed - and needs to be forcibly stripped free. Why deliberately choose the extra-traumatic option? * Infants cannot be given sufficient pain relief, either during the operation or during the healing process. There's research to indicate that the trauma has permanent effects on neural development, including permanently lowering their pain tolerance. Why would you do that to your own kid?  * A diaper environment is a *terrible* place for a wound to heal. Jesus, just think about that.    And that's not even covering stuff that can go wrong. Google for 'botched circumcision' sometime, along with 'necrotizing fasciitis'.   In short: there's lots of inherent downsides, lots of risks, no benefits, and no all-fired hurry to do it as a child.   Just leave it alone. Your kid does not need bits cut off him.  
TwoXChromosomes X Absolutely fine to have sex during that time.  You are protected, provided you have not skipped pills and you are taking your pill as prescribed :)
Parenting X &gt;but circumcision to FGM is like amputating a finger is to amputating an arm  That's the point. They're both genital mutilation. The argument they use is  that the male one mutilates less. If you're given the choice between a cosmetic surgery that chops off your pinky and your arm, your choice will be "neither".
TwoXChromosomes X Well, I've had mine for about five or six months. I have a Femmecup which are smaller than the Diva Cups. The way I put mine in as fold it in half and just slide it in. Once the cup unfolds, it grabs on to your walls and though it sounds uncomfortable, it's a slight as a tampon. Mine is a little difficult to get out but pretty much what I do is just grab the nose (my friends [guys] call it a rocketship) and pull. It's important at this point to be relaxed since it might be a bit uncomfortable. And it's kinda awful taking it out in public because you can't really wash it out but I just wipe mine with some toilet paper and be on my way. Hope that was informative. :)
TwoXChromosomes X It catches everything, really - I've had perhaps 2 occasions when I had a bit of overflow, and those were overnight. If I'm sleeping, I can't really sense when I need to do anything about the cup.  I can usually wear mine for anywhere between 4-12 hours depending on flow (and that 4 hours is when my entire uterus has decided to get the fuck out).  Is the Diva cup soft? I have one called Lunette, and it's made of silicone. Totally amazing.  
TwoXChromosomes X I fold mine into a 'heart' shape, then give it a twist or turn once it's up there to get it in a comfy position. That also ensures that there's a vacuum seal to stop any leakage. You take it out by pushing the side of it in (WITHOUT PULLING, there's a vacuum seal!) to break the seal, then pull it out. Tip into toilet, wipe (or rinse with hot water if you can), reinsert. Boil it once a month for about 3 min between shark weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X This past weekend my period totally caught me by surprise when I was at my boyfriend's (It was a whole 7 days early--I do track the thing and I'm normally prepared).  I had to use not just tampons, but applicator tampons because that's what his sister had.  I have never used those before--it was an experience.  I'm not enamoured of tampons much after using the diva cup for so long--it totally throws off my moisture balance.
TwoXChromosomes X The first few days of my period are super heavy, and the Cup is suuuuuch a relief. I usually have to empty my cup three times on my heaviest day, as opposed to going through 7 or more tampons.  As far as messiness goes...I won't lie, when I first started using it it was MESSY AS HELL. It took me a good three periods or so to really get used to getting it to fit right, and emptying it without making such a mess. I mean, sometimes it would look like I just murdered someone with my bare hands. Now that I've got it down, everything stays tidy and I can comfortably/securely insert or remove it it in just a few seconds.
Parenting X During the first six weeks, I would pump one feeding worth and go to bed early. Around ten, my husband would take the pumped milk in a cup, let my son suck my husbands clean pinky finger, and my husband would insert an eyedropper if milk periodically. It enabled me to get a resonable stretch of sleep, and then I'd take over for the night shift. This way we had ne concerns about nipple confusion or anything and my husband was able to help with those tough early days. It's a great trick and I reccommend it.
Parenting X Yup.  We did a little bit of formula to build up their strength.  It actually makes breast feeding easier.  Even our lactation consultant and doctor suggested this.  I would do this before water.  They really are not supposed to have water that early on.  As far as cluster feeding goes, we had this with twins!  It was a nightmare but we got through it.  Everything is a phase.  Get through one and then onto the next....
TwoXChromosomes X So, I generally don't *have* to empty it in the public restroom, but it has happened a handful of times. I'm at school for up to twelve hours at a time, so I do occasionally find myself needing to clean it out.  Here's what I do: I carry a wet bag (I make'em; they look like a little makeup bag but are line with a plastic cloth) which holds my backup cup, a disposable pad, and a cloth pad. This goes with me into the bathroom. I remove the cup while on the toilet and dump what I can into the water. I use some TP to wipe the excess off of the cup and myself. I flush, go back outside to the sink, rinse my cup, and then return to the toilet to re-insert.  Much easier, though, if you can get into a bathroom where the sink isn't divided from the toilet itself. We've got several of these (unisex) bathrooms at my school and I prefer them when I'm menstruating, since it makes handling cup cleanup a lot easier.  I carry the spare if something unforeseen happens to the first one (dropped on the dirty floor, ends up in the toilet, etc.). I keep the pads for "just in case" - partially in case I need to give (the disposable) to a friend and partially in case my body doesn't want to cooperate with the cup and I need an alternative.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a fellow light flow lady, and that's actually why I started using the cup. It's perfect. No need to change it for 12 hours, no scratching your insides, no hunting to find a box of light tampons, no wasted pads. You should definitely try it.
TwoXChromosomes X Hey, don't be scared! While you get used to it, wear a pad or pantiliners if you're nervous.   It is so worth a try, I promise. The keeper or mooncup is where its at, don't use the instead cups to try to switch. Theyre not the same at all.
TwoXChromosomes X If you set in place right, does it stay in place. I am a bit worried about it getting messy from moving around. I have always used pads my period doesn't last long. If I use pads as apposed to tampons. When do you need to replace it? 
Parenting X Still, the baby will not suckle as long if he/she is filling up some from the supplement. I had to use a supplemental nursing system too, but for different reasons. I pumped and used my own milk, because I had enough and could. Maybe OPs wife could express a few drops of milk instead of using water. 
BabyBumps X I felt the first movements around 16 weeks, and for me it was a fluttery feeling, like if you imagine your tummy as a fishbowl and there are some small little goldfish swimming around. Having said that, I was 20-21 weeks by the time my partner could feel anything. For me, feeling movement is one of my favorite parts of pregnancy. Congrats!
BabyBumps X First time was 20 weeks. I think I always thought it was gas before that, but at 20 weeks I was certain.  Second time I felt a very distinct flutter at 10 weeks. I only felt something every few days at first, but very regularly by the time I was 22 weeks or so. 
BabyBumps X &gt;i believe ill deal with problems as they arise  The problem with a disease like PKU is that by the time your child is exhibiting symptoms, he might already have brain damage.  Testing for PKU insures that the unlucky few babies out there will start to get treatment before real damage is done.  &gt;you should go live in other countries and see how differently they handle their children.  Almost all developed countries have newborn screening programs.  They might handle their children differently, but apparently they also see the value in this testing.  
TwoXChromosomes X Lucky :( I was on OTC for about a year and it made my periods go from 4 days to 7-8 -- and gave me unbearable cramps. I already had cramps but OTC made me bed-ridden 1-2 days a month they were so bad :(
TwoXChromosomes X Have you changed pills? If not, have you been taking your pills regularly? Missing pills or taking them at varying times of days can lead to irregularity.. If you are on the same pills and are being consistent with them, at least call your GYN and ask if you should come in.
TwoXChromosomes X If you can find parents who'd adopt your kid, you should stay away from abortion.  The only cases where I find abortion to be acceptable is if the pregnancy is either endangering the mother's life or caused by rape.   However, killing an unborn life (regardless of how far the development has progressed) should not even be regarded as an option by people who fucked up with their protection. "But no method is 100% safe!" Yeah, the main purpose of having sex is creating offspring and you should keep that in mind. Taking a risk does not justify life termination.
Parenting X I had similar concerns about my youngest daughter's nose bridge and epicanthal folds but they went away long before 2.  I'm not sure that helps you at all, but I understand your concern and you should definitely keep on the doctors about it.  Has she had genetic testing for Down's?  I think they can karyotype with just a blood test?
Parenting X First off, if your child has been tested for down, and it hasn't shown up, then you should feel pretty safe.  Because Down is a chromosomal disorder, it's present at birth -- it's not something you suddenly develop.  Also, there are other things related to the epicanthal fold. Have you talked to your pediatrician about it? For example, there's Williams syndrome (although it's very rare), there's Cri du chat syndrome . . . 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, I would see the doctor or ask at the pharmacy then. You can always use the cream they sell for yeast infection (to relieve the itchiness) without the pills. It will most likely work if it's a yeast infection.
BabyBumps X I had the opposite experience - my ultrasounds were clear, but my bloodwork was all messed up and showed quite a high risk for Down's. We forewent the amnio (too high of a risk for my liking, and it wouldn't change my decision to keep the baby anyhow), and so far all ultrasounds have been clear. Currently at 29 weeks and hoping for another ultrasound in a few weeks to check up on the little one.  It's up to you how much testing you want done - don't let anyone bully you into anything, I know that I was really being pressured (by medical staff) to get an amnio, but I opted for more ultrasounds.  Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Ah, yes, that does change things. I would echo the advice given about first living together on a "trial run". And if you want kids: make a plan. Make sure he's as committed to it as you are, and that he will help you raising them equally. Agree on who will do what when the baby arrives. This is probably something you want to discuss before you conceive.
TwoXChromosomes X It's really different for everyone, for some people it's a minor inconvenience, for others it can mean really bad pain (cramps, headaches, etc.) and possibly days off from school/work.  For me it's not that big of a deal.  I get some cramps and a headache sometimes but overall it's very bearable and there's always midol or some other pain reliever if it gets too bad.  I actually don't think I have mood changes before/during my period.  At times I suppose if my cramps are bad I may not be as pleasant as other times, but I don't think I have hormonal mood changes, though it seems like a lot of people do.    I recently switched to using the [divacup]( ) which is quite popular on 2x but not as much out in the world.  It's a menstrual cup that you can leave in for 12 hours (as opposed to 6-8 for tampons).  I've found it curiously has reduced my cramps and makes periods a lot easier to handle.  It seems like it'd be messy but it's actually better than tampons in that regard once you get the hang of it.  
BabyBumps X As of today ....  I am... 9 weeks pregnant (I'm such a noobie!) my favorite part of pregnancy is... Planning the nursery set-up my least favorite part of pregnancy is... morning sickness....:( I'm most excited for/to... Hold the little munchkin and have some snuggle times!  I wish someone had told me... That pregnancy was a little like puberty all over again.  I can't wait to... Drink a cold glass of chardonnay and kiss some baby toes  my advice to someone recently pregnant is... Don't worry so much! Women have been doing this for millenia. 
BabyBumps X **As of today ....**  **I am...** 18wks pregnant  **my favorite part of pregnancy is...** Knowing my SO and I made this little thing growing inside me  **my least favorite part of pregnancy is...** How uncomfortable I feel  **I'm most excited for/to...** Know if it's a boy or girl!  **I wish someone had told me...** The truth on how pregnancy really is! (The vomiting, the sensitive stomach, the constant need to pee!!!...)  **I can't wait to...** Have an alcoholic drink  **my advice to someone recently pregnant is...** Eat right, drink lots of water, drink tea with ginger (it helps with the stomach issues!!!), and think positive.
TwoXChromosomes X I can only speak for myself, but if i know I can't keep a child, I'd much rather bring it to life and let loving parents raise it, than to kill it because it's "not a baby yet".   The line of thought that it would be more difficult for me to give it up is something i'd consider as selfish, and I certainly wouldn't be okay with killing my future kid over that. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't want to pressure you but since you're pro-choice maybe you won't be offended if I just say... if you're not capable (emotionally, financially, etc) of going through an abortion are you sure you're capable of motherhood? It's much more demanding, emotionally, physically, financially, etc. And, uh, a little bit more of a long-term commitment?  If you (like me) are pro-choice but maybe sqeamish about abortion for yourself, what about adoption? There are so many choices today surrounding open adoption where you can a part of the child's life (or not) to whatever extent you want. In return, you get to DECIDE when you want to have a kid and make someone's else's life very happy!
TwoXChromosomes X Congratulations!  You know it is not an ideal situation, but you seem to know you want to keep this child, it is a miracle and the joy you will have raising a beautiful baby will trump any heavy-hearted feelings you might have right now. Everything will work out.  
Parenting X Well, my daughter was born premature and she is now a healthy and happy 3yo and is the perfect size, if not a little bigger, than most girls her age. Do you have a nicu in your area?
TwoXChromosomes X Please please please get the abortion. You are ruin so many lives here. You're ruining his, his fiance's, your kids who will likely grow up without a father, and your own for having to raise a child on your own. Be logical, not emotional. Get the abortion.
Parenting X "The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth" - Henci Goer "Ina May's Guide to Childbirth" - Ina May Gaskin "Ina May's Guide to Breastfeeding" - Ina May Gaskin  also if you're interested  "Spiritual Midwifery" - Ina May Gaskin.  all are amazing reference tools
TwoXChromosomes X My "normal" lasts about 4-5 days, and involves pretty awful cramping the day before as well as the first two days. Also menstrual migraines near the end. :(  tl;dr: 5 days of my body hurting literally all over.
TwoXChromosomes X If it is any type of UTI you will regret not going to the doctor. (If cranberry juice doesn't work) You never know how AWESOME to pee pee all the way (being able to completely empty your bladder.) 
BabyBumps X As of today .... **I am...** 12 weeks pregnant  **my favorite part of pregnancy is...** seeing the baby on the ultrasounds  **my least favorite part of pregnancy is...** feeling barfy  **I'm most excited for/to...** find out if it's a boy or girl!  **I wish someone had told me...** how uncertain pregnancy is  **I can't wait to...** meet my child thennn have a BIG BEER  **my advice to someone recently pregnant is...** RELAX, enjoy the ride!
BabyBumps X Sadly there isn't anything we can do to prevent them really. There is no need to wait usually, they mainly say this for dating purposes.   It is very scary starting over. Myself I had a chemical pregnancy then a miscarriage and with my current pregnancy I suffered a vanishing twin. I'm 7 weeks away from this baby making her debut and I'm still nervous.   Just take a deep breathe and try. I just held my breathe until 13 weeks with this pregnancy. 
TwoXChromosomes X Your doctor knows more than your friend. If you don't like your birth control brand, your doctor will prescribe you a different one. As long as you read the directions on your birth control and take it properly (no antibiotics, no smoking, etc) AND you use the condom properly, I think your chances of preventing pregnancy are much better than just the condom. Just remember that the pill doesn't protect against STDs but the condom does.
TwoXChromosomes X Good choice!  Garlic and yogurt are the best ever for a nasty horrible yeast infection.  :3  Just be careful of not giving yourself a UTI (because I...have done that -_-)
TwoXChromosomes X First off- echoing the many "talk to your doctor!" imperatives.   Secondively- if it were I, I'd be wary of the YAZ. I was on a version of it for a while, and it gave me ridiculously awful mood swings. That being said, everyone is different, and it might work well for you. If you've consulted your doc and done your research and decided that YAZ might work for you, then go for it!  C- Yeah, birth control has side effects. That's what happens when you mess around with hormones. Just be aware that if the headaches/ nausea that may accompany starting the pill don't stop by the end of the first month, you should see your doctor.   And finally and most importantly- no form of birth control, be it condoms, pills, or even surgical sterilization, is 100% effective. If you're sticking with only condoms, make sure you're using them correctly, and that they're not expired. If you're on the pill, it won't be effective immediately, and certain other medications/antibiotics could reduce its effectiveness. Do your research; make sure you know what you're getting into!  edit: formatting
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on the pill, and when I stop taking it, it takes 2-3 days before anything starts moving. I usually wear tampons for at least a day during which nothing happens - I think you'll be fine as long as you go with the light-flow ones. TSS is very rare, so just make sure to change it regularly. You can try the Diva cup, but nearly all testimonies I've read say try it for the first time at home, where it's okay for it to be a messy disaster (difficulty getting it in and out, etc., though you wouldn't have to change it during dinner). 
TwoXChromosomes X Increased blood pressure means increased blood clots from inability to pump the blood correctly, increased blood clots in your blood vessels means increased chance of having a stroke.
TwoXChromosomes X If you believe him, then you're fine and you're not pregnant. If you're still paranoid, you could always get some Plan B at the pharmacy to ease your anxiety.
Parenting X Oregon actually DOES have a board of direct entry midwifery, but licensing is still simply optional to practice there.
TwoXChromosomes X If it's a yeast infection, yes. If it's not, well, it won't hurt! Smear it all over a tampon and stick it up your cunt. Make sure it's really plain because the sugar added to other yoghurts will actually do damage. I hope you feel better soon!
BabyBumps X I had morning sickness for 5 months with my first. I was more sick with the first more tired with the second.....unless morning sickness gets worse. Oh God, I hope not.
BabyBumps X Why did your midwife decide to transfer? What was the transfer rate of your midwife? Did your caregivers ever find a reason for why labor was so prolonged in your case?  I have a friend who says she labored for 72 hours! It was a huge battle to ward off the hospital staff who wanted to just do a c-section... but she got her vaginal delivery like she wanted (baby was being monitored and was doing fine).   I think people will be able to ask less general questions if we get to read the birth story first :)
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using generic Seasonale for years and would never switch back. Like others said, I have short, light periods, and you only have to worry about it 4 times a year. I've had occasional breakthrough bleeding, but it is not typical (for me). 
BabyBumps X Are you including early labor in that 57 hours or was it all active labor? Was your water broken? How often did your midwives listen to your baby's heart?
TwoXChromosomes X Oh, i don't know, i actually haven't been to a doctor because of this. I've just collected some advice that told me to 1) drink a lot and 2) stick to cranberry juice.   However, I would assume that i'd be fine with a repressed UTI too, if it helps my peeing pain and still gives my body time to clear it on its own. 
TwoXChromosomes X Be careful. Chlamydia presents with many of the same symptoms as UTI's (stinging pee, needing to pee often but not actually peeing very much when you do go, etc). If you're getting them consistently get yourself tested. To be fair there are some people who get them regularly and are STD free but there are also others who don't realise they have Chlamydia and go on to spread it etc.   Other than that, cranberry capsules have been shown to help support the urinary tract and you're already peeing after sex so there's not much else you can do unfortunately. 
TwoXChromosomes X I used to get them all the time too.  The water, cranberry juice/extracts and peeing after sex didn't do anything to change it.  I now have antibiotics that I take prophylactically (every time I have sex) and I don't get them anymore.  Unfortunately, not all docs will prescribe them like this, but it couldn't hurt to ask next time you go in.  "You know, I get these so often that I feel like I'm in here every other week.  I've been doing some research and I've heard that some women take a small dose of antibiotics whenever they have sex to avoid getting UTI's.  Is this a possibility?"  
TwoXChromosomes X But the images they show are dishonest.  They use gruesome  pictures of decapitated late term miscarriages and tell people they are earlier abortions.  I find nothing gruesome or distasteful about scraping something the sized of a quarter with no sensation out of a uterus. I find the thought of forced birth pretty gruesome though.
TwoXChromosomes X It could be. I had TONS of crazy problems and we actually thought it was M.S. There's certainly no harm in having your levels tested. Keep in mind that it's tricky. I was considered normal but always on the cusp of being abnormal. Eventually I had to have it removed and go through periods of no thyroid replacement hormone and then too much. Every symptom I had could be linked to those two states. It's worth investigating, imo.
TwoXChromosomes X If it hurts, stop! You don't want to teach your body that sex hurts. Have non-penetrative sex until your pain is fixed.  My husband and I have a great sex life, giving each other orgasms with our hands, mouths, sex toys and other body parts (eg [intercrural sex]( _sex)).  If the first doctor you see can't help, get a referral. A urogynaecologist diagnosed my severe vaginismus and mild vestibulodynia and set up my treatment.  Feel free to keep me updated or ask me anything. 
TwoXChromosomes X Your hormones might be fluctuating since you're due for your next shot. The shot has been great for me (2+ years). I stopped having my period immediately, and the only time I experience any kind of PMS (I was a mess every month before BC) is if I'm not right on time with my next one. Unfortunately, with BC, every woman is different and you'll find horror stories about each one.  If you're symptoms are that frustrating, however, you might try something different. 3 more months is a long time to wait and see whether they'll stop.
TwoXChromosomes X And if the womans life is at risk? Or her child will be born with a horrible disease/genetic defect causing them to die early and live in pain?
TwoXChromosomes X The part where he asserts that unwanted pregnancies "can only arise from a callous carelessness on the part of the parties involved." 
TwoXChromosomes X I take Loestrin and you're fine. They reason the pharmacy is saying that is because with other birth control pills that are polyphasic (rather than monophasic like Loestrin), you have to take each pill at the same time because they contain different levels of hormones depending on what time of the month you take them. Loestrin works differently, so you have the same level of hormones in your system during all your active pill weeks.   TLDR: As long as you only miss one pill, you're safe!
BabyBumps X I have thought about that but it is really hard to tell when things started to go wrong and there is no way to ever know. I really trusted my midwife and I think if I had gone to the hospital any earlier there would have been a pretty good chance of me having a c-section and not a vaginal delivery. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I take cranberry pills. I feel like the sugar in cranberry juice fuels the bacteria that causes UTIs. Plus the pills are more concentrated and without the sugar. My gyno said it's fine to take pills instead of juice.
TwoXChromosomes X This is a huge decision to make both ways. I say try picturing your life in the future with a child and without a child. Beyond taking care of a child you need to know that you will have to work to support the child and that many of your future plans will completely change.  As for your boyfriend.... It is true that it is your body, but that doesn't mean that the child isn't his. He is entitled to his opinions and as much as he needs to respect your opinions, you need to respect his. He is freaking out, he seems to know he cannot raise a child and that he will not raise one at this point. Nevertheless, if you go against his wishes, have the child and break up with him... he is still entitled to be a part of that child's life if he so chooses. Personally, I have witnessed relationships fall apart because they had to make this decision and either way you go, you will be going through a whole lot. Though it is anecdotal, I know how difficult this decision is. No matter what this will be a very testing and emotional point in your life. I hope that the two of you can resolve your differences and that you make whatever choice is right for you, your boyfriend and the child.  edit: Just to be clear, I am not advising you either way. I just want you to know that this is a huge decision in which multiple parties are involved, that you need to seriously think about. That may not be much help, but it is the best advise I can give. I'm glad you have a good support system and I wish you the best of luck either way.
Parenting X My next birth will be a home VBAC even if I have to do it alone. My first son passed away in utero from a simple condition that the Dr should have noticed and delivered me sooner. I was induced shortly after. Pitocin is the devil and I was in pain even though the epidural.  My daughter was born via unnessacery c-section because my Dr didn't want to deal with me any longer and it was a holiday weekend. She lied to me and told me my baby was going to die unless we got her out.I ended up with PTSD and post partum psychosis from the trama of the delivery.  My next pregnancy..higher powers willing as I have infertillity issues..will be a home VBAC with a midwife and doula and I can't get them I will be doing it at home alone with a back up plan for the hospital.  Plan for the worst and make sure you trust the people that are going to be delivering your baby. Talk to other people that have used them.Read up about them online. Check sites like yelp and rate mds.
BabyBumps X I did a 36 hour labor and 2 1/2 hours of pushing before an emergency c-section. I feel your pain. I didn't even got to push my baby out! now I am 6 weeks til number 2 is due and have a planned cesarean...can't go through that again!
TwoXChromosomes X I didn't bleed at all. But, as far as I know some bleeding is normal. A couple of things are good to keep in mind here, first of all, everyone's hymen is different. Some people's are barely existant (like mine was) and some almost entirely (or sometimes even entirely) cover the vaginal opening. If you tear more tissue it's reasonable to assume it will bleed more.   Second, people can easily think they've lost a lot more blood than they actually have. Blood looks dramatic, it's bright red and eye catching, people tend to just panic about it.   If it's just light, spotting type bleeding it should be fine as long as it tapers off within the next day or so. If not, you should see a doctor. If it's *heavy* bleeding, it could just be your period.   Lastly, even if you're on your period you should probably go ahead and take Plan-B.   Better safe than pregnant. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's one of the few educational policies we continue despite every objective test finding it both ineffective and dangerous (it often curtails condom use). Particularly when we have comprehensive sexuality education, which stresses abstinence as the only 100% way to protect yourself, but also discusses safe sex and healthy relationships.   CSE has been proven to both delay the onset of sex as students make decisions about when they are ready, but makes them safer when they do choose to be active.
Parenting X My wife just had one (emergency) due to the baby being breech and her water breaking.  I can attest as an outside observer I would never want to have one.  Moving and caring for the baby was pretty much not an option without help for the first week.  Hearing these stories of elective c-sections makes me wonder what sort of misinformation they were given to think it is an "easier" option.
TwoXChromosomes X It's good that your going! Don't be scared. It takes 30 seconds to do a pap. They will probably do a breast exam since it is your first time, really simple and fast as well. I don't know what advice to give other than it really is no biggie and don't be scared! Unless you are having any problems, I can't think of any questions other than birth control if you are interested? I make conversation with my gyno and it makes it less weird and goes by really fast. Good luck!! 
TwoXChromosomes X I cannot orgasm from only vaginal stimulation at all. It feels awesome and I actually prefer penetrative sex to oral, but it never gets me off. Instead, what I tend to do is touch myself whilst having sex. That usually does the job.
Parenting X This. Some women can't breastfeed. Some babies and mommies are unable to become proper nursing partners. Mine never latched due to nipple confusion (hospital gave her a bottle at birth against my wishes). I pumped and pumped and when I went dry I had to give in. These things happen. Breast feeding "advocates" need to chill the eff out. They don't do anything except *stress out mommies who can't breast feed*.   Also why was your post downvoted? There is no call for that. 
TwoXChromosomes X Dehydrated after frequent urination. Some medicines can make you pee, thus dehydrating you.
TwoXChromosomes X I just worry over the possibility that people who find themselves pregnant accidentally don't consider any alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. Perhaps it isn't the right time to raise a child but there are many families who are on massive wait lists to adopt a new baby. 
TwoXChromosomes X And I think that's why most pro-choice people hold that a fetus becomes a "person" when it is viable (can live outside the womb, on its own). And then we get into conversations about when viability begins etc etc and on and on it goes.  
TwoXChromosomes X 60% of all pregnancies are naturally terminated or "aborted" by the body for a number of reasons. it's not a life when the egg splits. it's a potential life.
TwoXChromosomes X I think IAreSeriousCat was referring to anyone pro-life who seems to consider children miracles in most contexts, but when it comes to unplanned pregnancies they say that abortion is a cop-out and the "sluts" should be punished with having children.
TwoXChromosomes X spotting is sometimes experienced, bleeding like a period is a problem. See your Dr. Bleeding is not a sign of pregnancy.
TwoXChromosomes X I would recommend googling this problem re: your particular pill. This happens to me EVERY time I try to skip a period. I'm on Nuvaring, and when I searched this problem, I discovered that taking the ring out for a few days could interrupt the bleeding. It worked like a charm. Not sure if taking no pills for a few days would have the same effect, but it's worth checking.  Meanwhile, my vote would be for manual, oral, and period sex. Just go for it!
BabyBumps X For the last two days my nausea subsided (i had it really bad, no vomitting though) and i started to really worry. Had my first sonogram today and i have a perfectly healthy baby! 
TwoXChromosomes X Why do you say it's reckless? An abortion is a lot safer than carrying a pregnancy to term.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;its acceptable to end the life of a non-sentient lump of cells.  Why do you describe it as a "lump of cells"?  Is that to minimize the impact in your mind?  Passed the first few weeks, it's not an accurate description.
TwoXChromosomes X I was one of those "consequences" of a mistake and I can tell you, forcing someone into giving birth to their child does not make them "lovingly raise" the kid, just makes it harder for them growing up knowing they weren't actually wanted. In a lot of cases, "pro-lifers" are punishing the baby more than they are the mother. Just sayin'
TwoXChromosomes X yah I had the copper one before, and it really made my periods a lot heavier.  Switched to Mirena (does not affect my mood) and my periods are SUPER light.  Very happy, had it for 8 years (I'm on my second one now).
TwoXChromosomes X Totally agree that it's worth getting the copper IUD. I can't use hormonal contraceptives either. Like you, I found that my period was really heavy to begin with but has gotten lighter with time - it's not really much heavier than before now and I've had the IUD for over a year. It would be nice if there were more (reliable) non-hormonal alternatives out there though I think :)
BabyBumps X my pregnancy uptil about 8 weeks (sore boobs) and then after that nothing until 13 weeks with some minor back pain, has been uneventful. Luckily I didnt never had morning sickness, so I've just been growing a baby with nothing to show for it. lol
TwoXChromosomes X I got a Diva cup (the small size) but it's *way* too big. Mostly in that it's too long for me, I trimmed the stem all the way to the base and it still protrudes/is visible when inserted as deep as I can get it. I want to try the lunette or the moon cup, but I've been pretty broke as of late. Whenever I get some better paying work I'm *definitely* getting one. It seems like an awesome thing to use and would save quite a bit of money in the long rub, 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay just wondering.  It seems like it's positioning, but I was just asking but I know I do get some spotting even though I know it's (DivaCup) in correctly when there's already blood in there, since the cup doesn't absorb it.  Maybe a different size would help?  I have the DivaCup which I've heard is bigger than some of the other cups.  
TwoXChromosomes X Well to be quite honest, 'life' isn't an issue for me. I can accept the argument that as soon as a sperm and an egg meet, a potential human being has been created. This does not make me feel any differently about abortion. So what if it is a human life?   BUT a 'potential' human being is different from an individual, actual human being, and I would say that this distinction arises as soon as the fetus is capable of living outside of the mother's womb. This does not need to be a full 9 months, since healthy babies can be born prior to this, but I certainly wouldn't consider a 12 week old fetus to be an independent human life. It is a potential human life that is still entirely reliant upon the mother's womb and body for protection and nourishment. So I hope this answers your question... I feel that an individual life begins as soon as the fetus is not entirely reliant on the mother in order to survive.   If the fetus gets protection and nourishment against the will of the mother, I feel that she has every right to be rid of it. No human being alive today is allowed to impose themselves on another in such a way.
TwoXChromosomes X and now she is going to be stressing about a possible pregnancy on top of this?  If her period is a week away yet (assuming a 28 day cycle), she would barely be past implantation (if there was a fertilized egg) and most pregnancy tests aren't going to be sensitive enough for pick this up
BabyBumps X I felt "not pregnant," other than the tiredness, for basically the whole first trimester. (Don't hate!) Don't let it stress you out -- you have enough to stress about as it is! Enjoy the "easy" days as much as you can. 
BabyBumps X They'll probably check for it, but you may not be able to hear it yet.  My doctor said sometimes they can't find it until closer to 11 weeks.  My son was super wiggly during exams so I didn't finally hear it until my 20 week ultrasound.
BabyBumps X I had one at 8 weeks to measure how far along I was (according to my period I was only 4-5 weeks, but my uterus felt further along). Then I had one at 12 weeks for those standard abnormalities test. I had one again at 20 weeks, which is that one big ultrasound (I'm surprised you didn't get that one, I thought it was standard procedure). That's usually all my doctor gives, but I was measuring really large (at 37 weeks I was measuring 43 weeks) so I had an ultrasound every week after 37 weeks. 
TwoXChromosomes X So they're suggesting the devil is the one making me have an abortion? Why can't it just be my own choice with no influence other than my feelings that I can't raise a child and don't want to force another baby into a corrupt fostering program? I don't like the idea that they're saying things like that. Its a scare tactic. 
TwoXChromosomes X That would be spotting. Its not as heavy as a period, it doesn't last as long, and its not bright red fresh blood like a period.  Calling it a period is a dis-service to women who through abstinence only education do not know what is going on with their bodies. 
BabyBumps X I'm in Canada, and I've had 3 "big" ones. At 13 weeks to date the pregnancy, at 20 weeks check for abnormalities and to measure, and at 29 weeks because he was moving too much at 20 weeks to get good measurements.   I've had 2 really quick ones at my last 2 Dr's appointments because I'm 38 weeks and the baby still hasn't turned. I'll likely have one more on Monday.   It's probably better that you don't have too many ultrasounds because that means everything is going well and your baby is healthy. 
BabyBumps X I'm having twins, so I've had brief ones at every appointment so far, but I've had full-scale growth scans at 11 weeks, 20 weeks, and 24 weeks (and I've been told there will be a few more of those.)
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely could be ovulation. I know at ovulation I get major PMS symptoms, super emotional, irritable, etc. 
BabyBumps X I wish!  the baby had it's legs closed, but the technician seemed like she thought it was a girl but wouldn't commit to it.
BabyBumps X I'm taking a course on Human Reproductive and Developmental Biology and we just went over ultrasound findings. Basically Choroid Plexus Cysts are found in many babies, and sometimes those babies do have problems. But they're more a red flag when something else is wrong, and should not worry you. 50% of adults have CPC's in autopsies when they die from unrelated things.  Also they're only a soft marker for Trisomy 18, not Down's Syndrome, so more than likely as long as your baby doesn't have anything else indicating abnormalities, you shouldn't worry about it.
TwoXChromosomes X When I stopped taking the pill (also at 25, incidentally, and also having been on it for 7 or 8 years) I noticed 2 things immediately: my migraines went away (only once every few years now instead of almost monthly) and my libido uhm... well, I suppose it returned to normal, I wouldn't really know because I went on the pill the moment I became sexually active. It basically went up a notch or 10 :D. I have not had PMS since I stopped taking the pill, despite the fact that the cramping and bleeding became about 10 times worse. I tried an IUD, but spent the next 8 weeks after having it inserted bleeding, so I had it removed again. My periods were shorter, more intense in a negative way, but overall it was a good thing to have done. Of course, OH had already had a vasectomy so that made going off and simply not using anything a lot easier. (Had my uterus removed quite a few years later so no periods anymore either, hooray!).
TwoXChromosomes X Does the ring make most people's periods shorter? Because I was expecting the same period I always get, which is also 6-8 days. It may be worth not using it continuously and getting a shorter period in order to not deal with spotting and irregularity. And I can't switch to a higher dose pill. Last time I was on a high dose pill was the worst three months of my life, and I just can't do that again.  Thanks for the advice and information.
TwoXChromosomes X For me, it's my lower back that just KILLS. It hurts to move, and I'm usually stuck in bed for 2 days. :(
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;and bacterial vaginosis   I've read so many "it's normal, it's natural, it's just you! Don't worry!" comments it kind of irks me. Day in and day out of discharge that is so thick your panties aren't in a normal state isn't normal.  Go to your doc/PP. Tell them your discharge is off, that you've changed dietary habits, etc and you suspect BV. Get a STI test if your sexually active while you're at it.   It's nothing a prescription of Flagyl won't wipe out.
TwoXChromosomes X My cramps have lessened when I switched from tampons to cup. Lessened SIGNIFICANTLY. I used to have really debilitating ones that left me bedridden one day a month, and now I literally have none. 
BabyBumps X I went in hoping to do it naturally and ended up getting an epidural.  I was induced around 10 am using a cervix ripening medication (no pictocin) and around 2 am I was exhausted and needed to sleep and couldn't because my contractions were too intense/close together and I was having back labor.  After the epidural I was able to sleep off and on for a few hours but it did make my contractions slow way down and my blood pressure drop.  I don't think I would have made it through to having my baby vaginally had I not gotten the epidural because I was have been too tired to push.    Seriously, have an ideal birth plan but go in with an open mind.  You never know what will happen.
TwoXChromosomes X I use BC to skip one period out of two. It halves the suffering, and then some because my periods are lighter with less cramps. My sister got the IUD with hormones and thus skipped three years of periods.
TwoXChromosomes X I love love loved tampons too and was really confused about women who professed pad-love, but I switched to the cup and now I'm a convert like everyone else. It's MORE comfortable than tampons, more convenient, can  be used for all activities. It's helped me get to know my own cycle better, it's helped me get rid of cramps (I didn't even realize, until after the fact, that tampons were causing me cramps) and pretty much, all the pros of tampons over pads are exemplifies in cup over tampon. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm wearing the Divacup right now, and I can't even feel it. It's more comfortable than tampons because there's no string and it doesn't feel dry when you put it in/take it out. It can take a month or two to get used to, but after that, I would never go back to tampons.
TwoXChromosomes X But it's *another* ethical issue. And outside the womb *any* adult can take care of it, preferably one that wants to. While in the womb, there is no choice. If a woman truly does not want the child, there is no win-win situation. Either you protect the physical integrity of women, or that of fetuses. In this case, you really can't do both. And i'll pick a sentient woman over a cell cluster any day of the week.
TwoXChromosomes X "sound" healthy means nothing. If you take antihistamines, or nasal decongestants you're already messing with the way your body naturally deals with being alive.   Birth control is no different. Just imagine: no period &amp; once the IUD is removed, no waiting period for your body to get back to normal. 
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, the first ob/gyn I approached about getting mine said she was hesitant because she had two women lose their fertility because of getting an IUD (two cases in 19 years) and she didn't like giving them to childless women because of that reason. 
TwoXChromosomes X Well, my pills say if you missed one pill, to take it when you remember then continue as normal. It's when you miss several active in a row that you need to worry. 
TwoXChromosomes X Paragard here- Me too. :) I wasn't a heavy bleeder before, but my periods *have* gone back to what they were before I started on hormones, which is awesome. I only bleed once every other month, if that. It's awesome to not have to worry about it (99%+ efficacy rates wooo~) and yet, not have to fuck with bleeding every month.  The lower blood pressure is nice, too. &lt;3
TwoXChromosomes X If you can spare the $$, get a box of pregnancy tests and take one every few days just to give yourself some peace of mind.  No doubt about it, as Lala_Clara notes, stress can delay menstruation.
TwoXChromosomes X First of all, props for being responsible. The 4 a year are cool, weren't an option when I was on the pill. From what I've heard, they work just as well as the others. Have you thought of norplant? You may gain weight, lose weight, be more moody, less, everyone is different, all you can do is try it and see how it affects you. Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X Oh, that's great. :)  By slight breakthrough bleeding, are you saying heavier than spotting but not heavy enough to be a real period? Hahaha. I'm bad with period flow terminology. I'm used to mine being really heavy.   One last question! Would you say you felt better on the pill or implanon? In terms of sex drive, emotionally, and physically?
Parenting X Get a good laundry system set up and show the useless help how to do it. My mother-in-law came for 5 days after my son was born, and I cried when she left. The laundry was always done and the dishes as well. Make sure she gets plenty of rest and take the baby if that's what she wants. I was so tired the first few days it was nice when someone would hold the baby so I could take a nap. :) You are an amazing friend and she's lucky to have you!!
TwoXChromosomes X How about we don't shame anyone? And how about we practice an encourage other to practice safer sex?
TwoXChromosomes X i used to work out 5 days a week, eating perfectly. was even a personal trainer. did not lose a pound. then my mom got cancer, stress found me, and i lost my appetite. -40 lbs later... my own body doesn't even reward me properly.  though...i wouldn't want to gain weight during stress...that would be punishment on top of punishment...but u know what i mean.
TwoXChromosomes X It really depends on what kind you use. For example, I'm on Errin (a POP) and if I miss it by like an hour and a half, apparently I'm okay in terms of protection (my specific instructions give me three hours), but I just set myself up for break through bleeding and cramping the next few days. I'm not sure if I've *ever* been this concerned with taking my pills on time.
TwoXChromosomes X The tests are accurate once your period is a week late, so this is a good plan.  Don't stress! Stress keeps periods away (until they can sneak attack).
TwoXChromosomes X You're spotting, it's perfectly normal. As time passes and you continue using bc, you should spot less frequently. I started out on a 3 month regimen and after a year I decided I didn't want 4 periods a year and skipped the placebos. I spot every few months but I haven't had a full fledged period since mid-2009.
TwoXChromosomes X Tonight, when I was curled up into a ball and wincing every time I breathed from cramps, my SO laid down with me and rubbed the tension out of the area. Menstrual cramps are the same as any other muscle ache, and for, say, a backache, you'd have someone work the knots out. Same concept. It was insanely intimate and relieved so much of the pain.
TwoXChromosomes X I track mine at mymonthlycycles.com. After a few periods, you can get an estimate of how long your cycle usually is, making it pretty easy to predict. You're pretty young, so your cycle might not be regular yet. Some women never have very regular schedules. YMMV. 
TwoXChromosomes X However, babies are capable of living on their own even if they're still inside the womb from some point on. And if the mother chooses to breastfeed her kid, it's still a parasite from your POV. So the borders are more than blurred - I would even say there are none.   If you define the parasitic character as the fact that the child is INSIDE of the mother, then it should occur clearly to you that the process of "getting rid of it" happens perfectly fine by itself after that time. And that's where adoption comes into play, as you mentioned. 
BabyBumps X By separating membranes, is that sweeping your membranes? From personal experience, if your body isn't ready it's just not going to happen without serious medical intervention. I had mine swept 3x and other then a couple of cramps, it never brought me into labor. If you're not dilated or effaced at all, they wont really be able to do it well [I think]. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you suck at remembering to take pills then they're more of a hindrance to you than help. Especially with low-dose oral contraceptives they have to be taken at the same time every day to be totally effective.   I would suggest the Mirena IUD. It's inserted and you don't have to worry about it for 5 years. No pills to forget. The Mirena (as opposed to the copper IUD) usually makes both cramps and periods lighter and shorter. 2 out of 10 women don't have periods altogether. 
TwoXChromosomes X I am a pacifist. I am against war and the death penalty and even self defense on a personal level (for myself).  I include abortion in the list of things I am against because I believe unborn babies are people.  I  don't understand why you assume that we are all in favor of indiscriminate killing for everyone except babies?
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not really sure what you think this proves? Having outside partners, having more partners however you acquire them, cheating... those are all risky behaviors. That doesn't make having many partners but being open about it safer than serial monogamy. There are many ways to put your health at risk, and many ways culture can encourage risky behavior. One way is eschewing the stigma associated with promiscuity, since stigmatizing promiscuity may have a value when we're looking at the public health risks associated with it. see, e.g. -6736(05)72403-X/fulltext  Another infamous way to encourage risky behavior is abstinence-only education.   No matter what the situation at the outliers, the safest way to conduct yourself, and the safest behaviors to encourage are... less risky ones.
TwoXChromosomes X I prefer my boyfriend's penis to every other penis I have seen or imagined, and his is UNCUT. He does keep it clean tho, which is important.
TwoXChromosomes X Just curious, why did you choose cloth pads over diva cup? Cloth pads sound really inconvenient.
TwoXChromosomes X I was always a die-hard pad user (my periods were just too heavy for tampons), but I've been using the Diva Cup a while now and love it. Just thought I'd throw that in!
TwoXChromosomes X Are you guys going at it for a fairly extended period of time? Are you switching positions a lot?   I don't know what it is, but when my guy and I do doggy style, I get really raw, abraded, dry, and sensitive, and it becomes painful. So maybe it's the position you guys are using.   What kind of lube do you use? Maybe try a different brand or style? Do you top up during the act, or just at the beginning?  Has he switched condom brands (if you guys use them)? Or perhaps you've developed a sensitivity to whatever brand he is using, and should try switching?
TwoXChromosomes X If it isn't normal pain from dryness or a-bunch-of-sex pain I would go to the doc ASAP. Sometimes yeast infections don't have symptoms, I've never had any "normal" yeast infection symptoms.    
Parenting X Look, it's hard. It's really hard. Maybe things will be different for you and maybe they will be better, I don't know you or your boyfriend, but starting out in life with a child to take care of... hard. Do you even know how much child care costs? Medical bills, diapers, formula (if you need it)? I'm not trying to scare you, but your mother has good reasons for recommending an abortion. I always assumed I would get one till I actually got pregnant. I had my kid early, 1 year later the dad was gone. I was just arguing with him today because he thinks $400 a month in child support is an undue burden (and he's 50 years old btw). I've pretty much done everything on my own, I've sacrificed much of any sort of "normal" life. I don't regret it. I love my kid more than anything in the world, I would happily sacrifice more if I could. You sound like you would regret an abortion. It's your body, your choice and your own decision, but be prepared. If you're gonna be a mom, be prepared to go it on your own. You already know what you want, you're just looking for someone else to be on your side and validate your opinion. Guess what?  Being a mature, grown-up Mom means it's your decision and you get to make it and you get to live with it. I don't mean to sound harsh, but that's what it comes down to. 
Parenting X From the tone of your post it sounds like you've already made the decision you want.  If you do what someone else wants you are going to regret that for the rest of your life.  Children are hard, but it is possible to have one and still go on with life.  I think the boyfriend is just scared, worried, and unsure as to what to do, give him time.  This might help you see if this really is a person you want to be with forever or not also..
TwoXChromosomes X Just a quick thought about this. Women need to fear epidurals, not childbirth!   In over three years of working in labour and delivery, I've only seen forceps required ONCE in a patient without an epidural. In patients with epidurals, on the other hand, we do forceps quite often. Epidurals are wonderful, but unfortunately they take away your body's ability to utilize gravity and positional changes (like squatting, using the birthing ball, hands and knees, etc) to rotate your baby and facilitate the physiological cardinal movements of labour and childbirth.   That being said, something like 80% of first-time moms will have an epidural. So its pretty commonplace. 
TwoXChromosomes X I freaked out at first and took a few tests, but quickly realized that the risk of pregnancy is so low with Mirena that there was no need, and haven't taken one since. I do PMS a little before the spotting happens, like I said there are cramps and an increase in acne.   The strings poking the husband is something that just has to go away on its own, though switching positions can help.   As to having "all the benefits and none of the side effects" there is no single form of hormonal birth control that won't have some side effect, and some women are affected by hormones more than others (like I mentioned, I am also taking an antidepressant, which lowers libido as well). 
BabyBumps X I didn't feel her move till the middle of my 22nd week.  My placenta is in the front so it took longer to feel her since she had to kick around it.  I got the best movement starting around 34 weeks, though.  This was when she turned and I could finally feel those high up kicks!! Before then it was waaay down, under my bellybutton. Don;t be discouraged if it takes a while, you'll feel 'em :)
Parenting X You said in Canada you get a whole year of leave - is it paid leave, or just "we'll hold your job for you" leave?  If it's paid, who pays it?  Is the company required by law to pay for it, or does the government pay for it?
TwoXChromosomes X That's what a TL;DR version will get you. ;-)  Some of this is semantics. Rhythm Methods is usually Day Counting exclusively. It's assuming your cycle is so long, and you ovulate 14 days in, or always on certain day. Sometime RM will use beads that you cycle through. That's not really how the body works though. Cycles change in length every month, ovulation days change for all sorts of reasons.   I always know exactly when I ovulate because I take my temperature every morning. I know reasonable well how long my boyfriend's sperm can live in me based on my cervical mucus. If you want it even more exact you can track your cervical opening/position.   If hormonal methods are working for you, I won't encourage you to change. I just want to present this as a viable alternative for people who can't stand the pill/shot/patch/ring.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're on a non-continuous pill (where you take the placebo pills for a week instead of continually taking hormone pills), then the bleeding you get is technically withdrawal bleeding, not a real period.  (That is, bleeding due to withdrawal from the hormones.)  The pill works by preventing ovulation, and this doesn't stop working during the withdrawal week.  Also don't feel stupid; they're not very transparent about this stuff.  But yeah, technically if you're on the pill you never ovulate or have a real period.  You could skip the withdrawal bleeding entirely and it would be fine.  I did that for about ten years, only bleeding every half a year or so.
TwoXChromosomes X Sorry, never been a tampon user! I get irritated down there with them in as it is, so I couldn't imagine what it would feel like hanging out with no blood soaking going on!
Parenting X I did extended breastfeeding on all mine. Actually, I weaned my first at a year, because I assumed that was what you did. Then she got sick and refused to eat hospital food, so I put her back on the breast, and didn't wean her again until she was two. My other children were four and five before they weaned.   At that stage, they nurse occasionally, if they are sick or injured or in need of comfort, but you don't have to drop everything and feed them in public.   In case you are wondering, I'm not a tree-hugger type, I just go with the easiest form of mothering, and this was it. 
TwoXChromosomes X I wasn't worried except for the cramping pain.  The cramping/pain sucks right now, but I think it will be worth not having to think about birth control for 5 years (could have been longer but I want to have kids in 5 years).  What I'm going through right now is the worst part.  In 2 or 3 months everything will be fantastic.
TwoXChromosomes X Planned Parenthood will put them in even if you haven't had a child.  I got mine in when I was on my period (so the cervix is more open and easier to put it in).  I have Paragard.
TwoXChromosomes X I have been taking the same BC for almost 7 months. That happened to me for the first couple of months. Now I don't even really have a period anymore. I do believe its working but it takes longer than 6 months for the hormones and stuff to regulate. Unless I'm wrong and I'm dying from some crazy un-period having disease.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, just a few months ago I had a full blood and lipid panel done. Everything came out normal.
BabyBumps X Don't lose hope just yet. I miscarried completely once at 6 weeks then with my current pregnancy I experienced a subchorionic hematoma/ vanishing twin at 6 weeks. I bled some red but mostly brown (old) blood for weeks until the hematoma healed.   Just hang in there. You just may see this tiny little blob pulsating at 7 weeks. I hope you do. 
TwoXChromosomes X "Yes, certain brands of birth control pills can be used in increased doses as emergency contraception. The Emergency Contraception Website has information about what brands of pills can be used and how to use them."  From [Planned Parenthood's website.]( -topics/emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill-4363.asp)
BabyBumps X The best advice I can give you is to read Toni Weschler's Taking Charge of Your Fertility and try not to stress/obsess about getting pregnant...enjoy the process :) Also, ovulation predictor strips and home pregnancy tests are super cheap on Amazon!
BabyBumps X Haha I know. I think it was a mix of old wives tales of how I was carrying and their gut feelings. When I found out the sex I called to tell my friends and they are like "we already know it's a boy!" They were clearly wrong :p
Parenting X My first never took a bottle at all. Not that we didn't want her to while she was in daycare, but she never did. She also never took a pacifier. She wanted nothing but mama! She weaned from the breast before her 5th birthday.  My second took a bottle at daycare just fine. She took a pacifier briefly for about 2 months but didn't really care much for it. She was off the bottle and onto the cup by 15 months. Still nursing at home.  We had old-style sippy cups that could spill, and for the no-spill ones we always took out the valves like you. My first could never get anything out of the valve cups anyway. Some of the newer cups are valve-less and also spill-proof (such as Take-and-Toss and Nuby soft-spout) and that is nice too.  I didn't have to break my first from the bottle or pacifier at all since she never took either. And it was not a big deal with my second since she was also still more attached to the breast than the bottle. As for the breast, I let my kids decide when to wean themselves.
BabyBumps X I also use an app called "My Days" but it just basically tells me when i'll get my period and a few days i "may" ovulate, so i probably should find a better one.
BabyBumps X I had spotting a few times during this pregnancy. Apparently it was from sex. My cervix is very tender and any contact with, for example, a penis, makes it bleed just a bit. I was also told by my midwife that some women spot all through thier pregnancy andits perfectly fine, although you always want to tell your care provider. A miscarriage is when there is a lot of blood. I had one a while ago, and it was unmistakeable. I bled suddenly and profusely, and the pain was intense. Mild to moderate cramping is normal in your first trimester. It's your uterus growing. When I misscarried, the cramping forced me to the ground.  Edit: I just wanted to clarify that the miscarriage and the spotting were in two different pregnancies. I'm currently 33 weeks along and this is the pregnancy I've had the spotting in.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks for your input, but everyone is different... I'm going to give it a shot.  If the esthetician's treatments don't work, then it's another round of Accutane for me (worked for me very well before I screwed up my hormones with a bunch of different birth control pills). 
TwoXChromosomes X straight from the website: "Please use caution when using any internal feminine hygiene product with an IUD as there is the possibility of dislodging it.  Many of our customers use The DivaCup and an IUD simultaneously, but we recommend that you become familiar with your particular IUD risks (such as the body expelling the IUD, etc.)."   Basically, ask your gyno and YMMV
BabyBumps X Haha I totally hear you! Yeah, the wait to test is always the worst :/ And it's like you never really know because everyone's experience is so different! When I had implantation bleeding with my first, it was like a regular period to me and it last 4-5 days, the only difference was that it came a week earlier then usual. 
BabyBumps X How much is she showing? I am 11 weeks and I think I am showing but I think I can hide it (work don't yet know and no one has mentioned it - they might think I have eaten all the pies)
BabyBumps X Well, the embryo is only about an inch long at 11 weeks, so it's not really big enough to move organs and cause the belly to stick out.  It's possible she's showing from her weight gain.  This happens with me when I'm pregnant.  All the weight gain is immediately in the stomach area!  I'm short, and I showed very early.  By 18 weeks, strangers could tell I was pregnant.  Many women don't get strangers asking them until more like 24-28 weeks.    Anyway, it's really nothing to worry about.  Showing earlier just means she'll have people giving up their seats for her and holding doors open for her and asking her questions about what she's having and when she's due and how she's feeling.  For a first pregnancy, that stuff is a lot of fun :)
BabyBumps X I'm so sorry for your loss, I've had two miscarriages in the past the second one with a D&amp;C. Give yourself all the time you need to grieve and recover and just know that it will happen for you, I got pregnant again about 8 months later (took 2 months before ttc after the d&amp;c 6 months to get pregnant) I just had my son three weeks ago. For now all you can do is just take care of yourself, when you're ready to ttc again ask your doctor about taking baby aspirin and progesterone in your first trimester.
TwoXChromosomes X [Torrid, a plus size clothing store, has a great selection. ]( )  [Avenue also has great stuff. I got two pairs for something like $30 at the end of last season. They always have great sales!]( -Size-Boots.aspx?DeptId=19963)
TwoXChromosomes X If you read the instructions on pregnancy tests they tell you the time limit and window to check. 
BabyBumps X 21 weeks yesterday! Due February 19th, 2012! Doc says they'll induce a week before, though, so about the 11th I think, unless she decides to vacate the premises earlier!
BabyBumps X Ohhh I want to know when you're due. We thought I was farther along then I was. My baby was a ninja and somehow managed to make me miss my august period even though I wasn't supposed to lol. I had implantation bleeding and was regular before this.
BabyBumps X 32wks here too, yay! my due date is first week of December though
BabyBumps X 27 weeks, official due date January 10, but it's twins so I've been told no later than Christmas...which seems to be coming fast! 
TwoXChromosomes X I think all of your answers were super helpful, I just wanted to mention one thing: I spoke to my doctor about getting a copper IUD, but she said it would be a bad option for someone who experienced bad cramps before starting BC.  Apparently something to do with the copper makes them worse.  Yikes!
TwoXChromosomes X Since I'm still learning, my experience isn't probably the best for you. LOL. But um, I tried what the manual said.   Essentially, you squat/squeeze to make the cup ride down lower in your vagina. Then, you squeeze the bottom to break the seal and slowly pull it out. 
TwoXChromosomes X When you put it in, you essentially create an airtight seal with the rim of the cup against the wall of your vagina to prevent leaks. When pulling the cup back out, you 'break' the seal to pull it out. Can you imagine trying to pull that cup out when it's still exerting pressure from inside your vagina because you haven't broken that seal? B| That would be very painful and uncomfortable.  edit. wording
TwoXChromosomes X Think about the size disparities. Rupturing of internal organs, massive internal bleeding... horrific &lt;=[
BabyBumps X 33 weeks and I'm due November 24th, Thanksgiving day!
TwoXChromosomes X There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to have sex.  Nothing.  So long as you're not hurting anyone, go have fun.   Just keep it Safe, Sane and Consensual .  Wear condoms, go on the pill, learn about safer sex, get tested for STIs regularly, try not to hurt anyone's feelings, be honest about your intentions, and go be as slutty as you want.  Also boys masturbate once or twice a day on average, and frequently more often.  
TwoXChromosomes X 3 months? Talk about over kill.   Most are 7-14 days if the cycle is started correctly in regards to your period, some people wait a month to be sure but that's normally not required. Consult your info pack and a pharmacist. 
BabyBumps X ~~10 weeks, I'm due May 7th. My original due date was April 30th (based on my LMP), but after two ultrasounds to measure the baby the doctor updated the date to May 7th.~~   Update: lost the baby had a D&amp;C today :(
BabyBumps X Haha, we're due-date buddies!  I'm due 4/25 as well!  Ready for the 2nd trimester?
TwoXChromosomes X No, because I take anti-depressants that can decrease the effectiveness of my birth control and I really really really don't want to get pregnant. I'm switching from the mini-pill to an IUD so I'm not sure how that will combine with my anti-depressants as I'm going to get a copper non-hormonal IUD.
BabyBumps X 17 weeks, due March 20...didn't find out I was pregnant until 13 weeks, missed the whole first trimester! :)
BabyBumps X Congratulations on your amazingly cute little one! As someone who is also hoping for a natural birth (albeit at home), can you share any pain management tips that really helped, or really didn't while you were in labour? We meet with our doula soon to discuss techniques I'd like to use, and would love some tips!
Parenting X I think it's really important.  Other people won't put as much stock in it but I truly believe that it is the responsible thing to do to be able to support the child on your own before having them.  It is not my job as a tax payer to pay to raise a child that you chose to conceive knowing full well you can't support them.  If you want a child work to get yourself into a position where you can care for them on your own.  Things happen and social programs are there to fall back but shouldn't be relied on when making the decision to have a child.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm actually implying that abortion should be treated the same way as spontaneous abortion (i.e. it should not be prosecuted or investigated in any way). I believe that semantics are important, and separating abortions from miscarriages as if they were vastly different things makes abortion seem much worse than it truly is.  I did state that medical abortions were essentially induced miscarriages, so clearly I'm aware that spontaneous abortions are not in any caused by the mother, and I did not mean to imply otherwise. I'm sorry if my statements were misinterpreted. 
TwoXChromosomes X No no no to anything Gap, Inc (Banana Republic, Gap, Old Navy). The quality has gone down but the prices have gone up. Not worth it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Most employers in the US are required by law to give maternity leave. 
TwoXChromosomes X I get cramps around the timw I ovulate and from about 3 days before my period starts till about 3 days into my period. 
TwoXChromosomes X Are you twisting it a little and tugging a little after it's in? By doing that you create the vacuum seal and should help with any leaking problems.  
Parenting X Yes, a fish! When I was pregnant with my first a male co-worker asked me what the movement felt like, I was only about 19/20 weeks and I said it feels like there is a guppy in there flopping around.  He said that was the best description he ever heard and now he "gets it" lol  My first I felt around 17 weeks, my second I didn't feel until closer to 20 weeks.  It will come!
BabyBumps X Babies can lose between 5-10% of their birth weight after being born and this is ok and expected. Some of it is tied to if you have an IV with saline pumping into you for an extended period - you gain water weight and so does your baby. Colostrum comes in very small amounts and it is supposed to, but as others have said, it's plenty for the first few days. My daughter didn't latch on properly for almost 24 hours and nobody told me I needed to supplement. They did give me a couple of drops of formula to put on my nipple to encourage her just to latch, but that was it. My milk didn't come in for about 5 days. Babies are given about 2 weeks to regain their birth weight and it's very doable. Breastfeeding is difficult at first, but with help and dedication it can become a very rewarding experience for mommy and baby.
TwoXChromosomes X My wife breastfed for about a month. The baby wasn't gaining weight so we took her into the hospital, and the doctor said she wasn't producing enough milk for her so we had to switch to formula.  Anyways, her breasts still look pretty much the same. They got a little bigger when she was pregnant, and she had to go up at least a cup size I think, but hers don't sag at all or anything like that. I think she's a C-34.  As a side note, an often unknown downside to breastfeeding is that unless you pump all your milk out then feed it to the baby in a bottle, it's very difficult to know just how much milk you are actually supplying to the baby, since it can't be measured when it's going straight from teet to mouth.
TwoXChromosomes X I use the diva cup and I love it!  BUT my period is really heavy so it requires me changing it every two hours the first two days (and I mean two hours is the MAX or else there's an enormous leakage).  I thought it would be able to last longer than super tampons or pads, but it can't, not for me at least.   I have figured out that I can use a super tampon in combination with the diva cup, which gives me four hours of protection (does anyone else do this??)   Not trying to scare you away from the diva cup, like I said I'm a diehard fan and I use mine every month, but only having to change it every twelve hours won't necessarily be reality for you.
Parenting X It took me a while to feel anything. I don't know if I was mistaking the fluttering for gas, but I didn't feel a real kick until 23 weeks. Then it was all day long, every day...and hard! it felt like she was going to pop a rib sometimes.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes! I'm actually using it *right now* lol   My worst day is my first day and if I have my diva cup in, I don't have to think about my period *at all*.  I guess I'm lucky to have a relatively light period so I can leave my cup in all day (about 12 hrs, but I've pushed it to 20+ hours before but not on the first day) and not worry about a single thing.  The only time the cup ever leaked for me was when I did yoga with it.  My friend has a considerably heavier period and it took her some time to get used to it, as opposed to me who loved it on the first try.  She said she used to have to change tampons every 1-2 hrs on her first day.  Now with the diva cup, she can keep it in for 5 hours on the first day until it starts to leak.  I think her period is so heavy that it starts to overflow beyond that.  So there is a bit of a learning curve based on your period but sooo worth it IMHO.  Another good thing about it is that you can keep it in when you're spotting and not worry about TSS.
TwoXChromosomes X Wow! Way to make me sound like a horrible person, when I was just trying to support her and tell her that the decision she made was not wrong and agree with her that she made the right decision for her and her child. Also, I was not saying that her anger is unjustified or invalid, I was trying to say that she should not worry about what other people are saying when she made the right decision.
BabyBumps X I'm about 6 weeks (confirmed), and I found out I was pregnant at 4. I found out I was pregnant because my breasts hurt so bad that I knew something was going on. I ended up noticing that I can squeeze out colostrum so I took a test. That was only at 4 weeks. Since then my boobs have grown a ton and I'm starting to see extremely faint stretchmarks on them. However, other than that, I haven't gained weight.  It is definitely possible that you're at 4 weeks, however, they'll definitely confirm at your first ultrasound. Not too many ways to tell until then.
TwoXChromosomes X I could not get the Diva cup to work for me, at all. I tried for something like 6 months, and I'm NOT shy with my body. When a tampon leaks, it's a tiny spot. When a cup leaks, the floodgates open.   And yes, I tried all the stupid tricks, like putting it in inside out, pinching it this way or that... I really wanted it to work but it just wouldn't. 
TwoXChromosomes X There's actually a whole livejournal group for cup users, they have a FAQ database and a really friendly community. I'm at work right now, but I'll link the address later when I get home. They'll answer all your questions and more.  So far I've only used the Diva cup, and I can say my results have been less than glamorous. I get a bit of dribble - nothing an everyday pantyliner doesn't cover, but it's not the flawless protection I hear about. My plan is to buy another brand (probably a Ladycup from the UK) - there is a slight variation of size and depth between brands. Just to clarify: I am not saying that the Diva cup itself is problematic - just that it's probably not 100% compatible with my particular vagina. But I've been using it for more than two years and I still love it.  As far as actually using it goes, taking it out and such, it's not messy at all. You just have to learn how to take it out - some advocate doing a "dry run" before you have a period with it. Putting in a cup when you are not menstruating, or not menstruating enough, is not nearly as frustrating and painful as trying it with tampons.  Since you can leave it in for 12 hours or more, I usually don't have to change it in public, but if it's one of those torrential downpour days, I can usually empty it into the toilet without too much of a bloodbath. You can just wipe it off with some toilet paper if you have to; your vagina is resilient. Otherwise I just empty it in the shower and before bed and have no problems. Also I try to boil it once a month, but really, I'm a disgusting slob and don't usually get to it *every* month.  edit: [cateeliz]( _not_crazy_just_because_i_ask_for_a_tampon/c2r059k) did a really great job at describing what it's like to put it in and take it out. I use soap to wash mine when I empty it, though. To each her own. I usually find myself lacking the proper amount of hands to hold it when I'm doing other things on the toilet, so I throw mine in my germ-infested sink. I'd say the soap is probably a good idea. Man, I am a slob.
BabyBumps X I woke up bleeding dark red blood. Later I had contractions.   Hope it's not a miscarriage. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I really dislike the idea of basically having a cup of blood in me  It's perfectly fine to prefer tampons to cups, but I'm not sure why having a cup of blood in you is any different from having a piece of cotton soaked with blood stuffed inside you.
TwoXChromosomes X Eh, the reason I wrap them up is because if I didn't, the bathroom would have a lingering bloody smell (even if the trashcans have lids).
TwoXChromosomes X I always carry O.b.s with me but I've had women in need reject my offering of an  O.B. Tampon Because they don't have an applicator and that's apparently icky. I dont get it. I prefer o.b. and would definitely take it over nothing!
TwoXChromosomes X They did. I've had dozens of colonoscopies and CT scans, barium enemas and small bowel follow throughs, and they have biopsied my small and large intestines with every surgery (5) and many of my colonoscopies. I have a j-pouch and no colon now, and while my cuff and small intestines are showing inflammation, it isn't enough to definitively determine whether it is UC or Crohn's. However, since I have been developing fistulas they are assuming it is Crohn's. I just started Cimzia on Monday, though! I hope it works! :)
TwoXChromosomes X I love mine. I had it put in during Feb 2007 and I fully admit it sucked for awhile. I had cramps and side pain... and then it stopped. I haven't had a proper period in months and I feel hormonally balanced. My only worry is having it taken out and dealing with insertion again in a few months. 
TwoXChromosomes X it's been working out really well! it's been really good because i bleed a lot and tampons just weren't cutting it (i can bleed through a super in less than 2 hours when it's bad). the cup is pretty easy to take care of, and i do get a tiny bit of leakage, but only when my flow is really heavy and it's been in there for a long time (like overnight). i just found out today how varied cup sizes can be, so i've realized that i probably should have gotten a slightly bigger one and then i wouldn't leak. oh well, this is the best way to deal with it i've found so far.  i think i probably will switch over to using cloth back-ups at some point. right now the extra washing sounds like a bit of a hassle, but i do like the idea of something more eco-friendly. there used to be a day when i was scared of non-applicator tampons, switched to them about 3 years ago. thought the cup was too scary, switched to it this year. i keep trying to be more eco-friendly, little by little.
TwoXChromosomes X I love it.  I haven't heard that it is the most effective bc out there.  More so than Mirena?  The fact that you can't miss a dose means that "perfect use" and "typical use" are exactly the same, so that certainly helps keep the pregnancy rate down.   I actually went in to get Mirena, but they sounded my uterus and determined that it wasn't long enough, and there was a risk of it ejecting the IUD.  Then one of the nurses suggested Implanon.  It's a synthetic progesterone, like Mirena, but only lasts for three years instead of five.  It's also a bit more expensive, but when I added up the cost of the nuvaring (the birth control I had been using) for that time, I realized the Implanon would pay for itself in two years (Mirena is more cost efficient because it's cheaper and lasts for five years).  They numbed my arm up and stuck in the implant.  It was sore for a few days, then itched a bunch for a few more because (as I read) a bunch of connective tissue was growing around the foreign object, and that would keep it in its place.  But some soreness and itching really aren't a big deal, just a little annoying.  I actually have had a few "periods" where I had light bleeding for a couple of days, but they've been few and far between and that will go away with time.  The only downside I can think if is that it doesn't prevent my from breaking out the way the Nuvaring did, so I've been needing to use proactiv to keep my skin in check.  
Parenting X I'm kind of jealous.  My son was more of a wiggler than a kicker.  I only ever felt one really good kick throughout the entire pregnancy, lots of really gentle kicks, and the occasional tapping on my pelvis.  Maybe the next one will be more active.
BabyBumps X I was noticeably pregnant at 8 weeks with this (my third) baby...people would guess that I was 4-5 months along when I wasn't even barely 2...
TwoXChromosomes X This terrifies me.  On BC - missed my first 2 pills of my pill pack, but used a condom.  Had a period.  BUT WHAT IF?  
TwoXChromosomes X I had a child when I was 19. I wanted a girl so bad. When she came out I thought I heard someone say it was a boy, and I felt disappointed. BUT I MISHEARD! I GOT MY GIRL! WOOHOO!
BabyBumps X I had a small little excuse for a belly when I was about 12-13 weeks, but when I was like 19 weeks my belly got HUGE. I swear it grows exponentially every week. I feel like I look more pregnant than I am. I had a friend who is 30 weeks along tell me that her belly is almost the same size as mine, and I'm 24 weeks. I'm 5'8" and thin, so I thought it would take longer for me to show. Psyche.   [This is from like a week ago. I feel huge!]( )
BabyBumps X You're right that squatting tends to be the best for birth, but for women who choose an epidural, that's not an option.  Most hospitals have multiple options for women who don't have epidurals.  For example, the hospital I'm going to has bars installed for women who want to labor or deliver by squatting.  This is a basic, city hospital.  So, even though you want a home birth, don't think that everyone who goes to a hospital has a one-size fits all birth.   
BabyBumps X I can't base this on fact, however, I have been told by a few mothers I know (one of them who I trust very much) that a few sips here and there is okay. FAS and FAE happens when the mother drinks in excess excessively- lots of drinking, every day or almost every day. I was also told that beer will help with lactation. I intend to talk to my doctor about the beer and lactation at my appt next week. If it's true, I'll probably have a few sips of my SO's beer probably starting at 34-35 weeks.  Personally, I have not had any alcohol since I found out I was pregnant. Would I like to have a few sips of wine? Yeah.... I may have a couple here and there, to enjoy it, but I won't get buzzed or drunk off of it.  Congrats, and good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X yea, my cycle is completely off because I stopped birth control. I was expecting my period the same day that I had sex. So... obviously I didn't ovulate before then (when I should have) since I didn't get my period. I'm just worried and confused.
BabyBumps X I am currently 30 weeks and feel huge, but my bump didn't really start to show until around 22 weeks. Before that I just looked like I had put on a few pounds. 
Parenting X We've got a Haberman with our daughter, who has a full cleft palate.  The other advantage of them is that if your infant cannot suck (due to something like a full cleft), you can squeeze the top to get milk into them so they don't need a feeding tube.
TwoXChromosomes X Uh, to use a much more analogous example than stabbing your neighbour, the point I'm making regarding moral obligation with rape is akin to [The Violinist]( _\(thought_experiment\)#The_.22famous_violinist.22_thought_experiment). Do you disagree with the conclusion the author makes regarding it being acceptable to unhook the violinist?   An analogy for consensual sex would be more like someone choosing to push a button with a .2% chance of causing machine to drain the blood from a violinist and hook him up to them for a transfusion. Even if they were not intending for that to be the consequence, they're obligated to save them, since they created the circumstances.  Hopefully that clarifies the difference?  &gt;Can you consistently define severe? Paraplegics? Mentally disabled? Deaf? Blind? Albino? What level of "wholeness" is acceptable?  For starters, with birth defects such as anencephaly, the fetus will never develop the congitive awareness that justifies protecting its life. Fair game.  But aside from extreme cases like that, in essence, it's about how the quality of life. How many paraplegics wish they were never born? How many mentally disabled people wish they were never born? It's a weighing between how much the mother must sacrifice and how much "good" life would be deprived if aborted.  IMO, it's generally best to err on the side of caution, as I do fully support the right to suicide for those who *do* find they wish they were never born.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Abortion is purposefully taking another human being's life through poisoning or dismemberment. A more accurate parallel with abortion would be to crush the violinist or cut him into pieces before unplugging him.  Uh, okay. Let's say that's the case in the violinist scenario, with appropriate caution given to making sure he doesn't feel pain, which is exactly how I'd advocate an abortion if it needed to be done. That doesn't change anything.  Given the circumstances, letting die and deliberately killing are morally equivalent. I'd also say that a mother abandoning an infant in the woods is morally equivalent to smothering it (excluding pain differences, just speaking of the death by abstention vs. death by action). If there is zero chance of survival if you deprive care, you might as well be actively killing them.  &gt;Hooking up an adult person to another adult person amounts to what many call 'heroic' or 'extraordinary' means of preserving life. We are not obligated to use such measures. A mother rearing a babe in her womb is NOT employing any such 'heroic' or 'extraordinary' measures, but the same ordinary means by which every babe's life is preserved and nurtured prior to birth.  How does this change my point?  &gt;the violinist scenario suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for her child than she has to strangers. Patently false based on jurisprudence. Courts prosecute negligent parents. Fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted.  I don't really understand why you're bringing up jurisprudence when your goal is to show why *my* beliefs are inconsistent.  Regardless, this still doesn't change my point. None of the stuff you've pointed out so far indicates inconsistency.  &gt;I disagree that poor development means this person doesn't have inherent human rights.  You'd argue that an infant that's missing most of its brain has a right to life, just because it's human?  I don't really buy that just having a particular arrangement of nucleobases grants rights and protections.
TwoXChromosomes X I haven't decided that life begin with brainwaves. Life begins at conception. If people don't want that, the only rational and scientific one would be brainwaves, and the beginning of "mind". As the mind-body problem has never been solved, it would be established that "life" begins at the first detectable brainwaves at 40 days. But then as this is not good enough to the abortionists, they would further mess with science to fit their pre-defined political views.  Making lungs necessary to life is distorting science to make "life" begin at birth, as you wish it was. It's a completely anti-scientific attitude. Do you believe science? Or do you base your opinions on ancient religious books? Really?
TwoXChromosomes X The story is sad and doesn't solve the mother's problem.  I wouldn't call pregnancy "rest"ful either (if she got rid of her 1 year old to "rest" before the next baby). An early abortion is much easier on a body than a full pregnancy and birth. Hello pelvic floor dysfunction and tearing!  Poor fictional mother. A doctor who won't provide the care she requires. Soon to have two babies because of moral guilt from someone who won't be helping her raise her children. Both the babies and the mother may suffer if she isn't emotionally, physically and financially prepared for this.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Life begins at conception.  So sperm isn't alive?  Life is an unbroken chain. Whether something is alive or not is irrelevant. Lots of things are alive but aren't given a legal or ethical right to live.  The way I see it, what matters is:  1. Personhood - is a fetus a person, deserving of the legal protections and responsibilities that implies? 1. If so, does that person have a right to use another person's body as a host against the host's will? 
TwoXChromosomes X Congratulations!  ...I'm happy because there was a huge clearance sale at Charlotte Russe today. Got me some cuuute tops.
TwoXChromosomes X Natural remedies can help, but there are lots of women who suffer UTIs despite following all available preventative measures. Some people are prone to UTIs due to the anatomical structure of their bladder and/or urethra. For example, there is scarring or stricture around the neck of the bladder, no amount of cranberry juice or hydration is going to completely fix the problem.
TwoXChromosomes X It's healthy. Especially if you have discharge normally---its perfeclty normal to have discharge, but i'm not so sure if it's healthy to have that sitting in your panties all day, esp if its hot! so changing liners so that it's not sitting there all day seems like a good idea, that's what I always do (I get discharge before my period sometimes) and i've never had problems with it. But then I don't wear them regularly. I usually only wear it a day or two before my period. I do know it's good to wear cotton panties to get air flow, and it can help prevent infections. It can also cause rashes (when I was 11 or so and started getting my period, I was terrified of using tampons, and so I'd always wear maxi pads--hate those things, they always gave me what is essentially a diaper rash, presumably because I didnt get much air flow down there) If youve been doing this for years and years, and never run into a problem from that, I imagine problems wont go starting now?
TwoXChromosomes X The copper IUD is 10 years, isn't it?   What annoyances and risks do you speak of?
TwoXChromosomes X I also came here to suggest the copper IUD. Sounds like you, much like me, simply do not react well to the hormones. The copper IUD is the one glorious hormone-free birth control (other than condoms). Not to mention it lasts forever.
TwoXChromosomes X There are different surgeries for endo (although I have NO idea about the success rates), and there are some medications for certain hormonal disorders.  I have heard a LOT of women with PCOS take Clomid and metformin to get pregnant, although those are for specific disorders.  But finding the cause is essential.  Scars were the first clue for me to PCOS, don't stop pursuing a diagnosis with your doctor.  Don't let them write you off and forget about you.  Besides, it seems like PID has similar symptoms to many female-related disorders.    OMG I don't think I could ever do surrogacy...I think that would be so hard to go through. 
Parenting X This is silly enough sounding but have you tried the natural shaped bottles?  Like the Dr Brown natural flow or Playtex Ventair?  On of my step children I helped raise had acid reflux (he was the screecher.) and the only bottles he would accept were the Ventair.  To get him the medication that helped his tummy problem we had to get him off the breast so we could mix the medication with the milk.  The Ventair bottles were a godsend!  Good luck, perhaps you can still find a way to get a break.
Parenting X Don't worry. It's not always like this. I'm not going to lie... you WILL have moments EXACTLY like this, no matter how awesome your baby is. But for the majority of people, they are few and far between. If they are more often, be sure to get yourself checked out for postpartum depression.  The best advice I can give a new parent is: do not expect instant and unconditional love for or from your infant. If it happens, great! But if it doesn't, remember it takes time to get used to each other and the life adjustment.  Good luck!
BabyBumps X I think you should call/talk at greater length to your care provider, whether it's a midwife or a doctor. She'll probably tell you that some spotting often occurs during early pregnancy and ask if you are also experiencing cramps or discomfort. Get a check-up, at 6 weeks ALP you are newly pregnant and sometimes the embryo burying into your uterine lining can cause some spotting. Best of luck to you and your baby and congratulations on the job!
TwoXChromosomes X Just buy it and keep them around for emergencies (visiting friends might need them, or a spare to keep in your purse, or you might need one temporarily while you boil &amp; wash the cup before use). Also, what if you buy the cup and you need some time to adjust to it but you have no tampons to go back to just in case?! Buy now! &gt;:)
TwoXChromosomes X I have, but I've also heard that in a lot of cases as far as the shitting stuff goes, it happens very often but typically the nurses swoop in and take care of it without ever saying a word. I would imagine that there are many cases where the mother giving birth is none the wiser.   I've also heard very many incredible, amazing things about childbirth, but when you're not there, in that moment, it still *sounds* terrifying.
Parenting X Lying in the hospital bed, hooked up to an iv, foley bulb inserted and feeling contractions. I'm told it will be a long wait.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 22, and really only started discovering myself when I started college.  I had a hairbrush with a ribbed handle that worked decently.  Now I have a couple of toys: [a glass dildo]( -pyrex-sex-toys/detail/IIda2/), [a clit vibe]( ), and a vibrator that is great for either focused attention on my clit or can give good vaginal orgasms as well.    You've got to let yourself relax a bit when playing with yourself.  Put on some music, give yourself some time, find something to get you all hot and bothered. I find that reading erotica helps me focus my thoughts (otherwise I can drift off thinking about random things I need to do).    If anything hurts, or you don't like whatever you're doing, then stop.  Everyone's body is different. Try something else.  Throw in some nipple play, or experiment with other erogenous zones.  Basically, have fun with your good self!
TwoXChromosomes X You poor soul! I would die. I'm on that pill that only gives me 4 periods a year. Thank God!  EDIT: I forgot to mention, when I do get mine it only lasts a few days and I only use light tampons, but I have horrible cramps to go along with it.
BabyBumps X I'm only 20 weeks (but with twins), so that could definitely be the problem! I can still wear my normal pants, but the bump then looks like I'm hiding a huge fat belly. Lol!
TwoXChromosomes X This sounds like endo.  I was just given bc to treat it, and it worked okay for me.  But I would look around for another OB/GYN for diagnosis.  There isn't a whole bunch to be done, other than bc and surgery.  But the doctors should be helping a little more than this.    (I'm 33 and I never connected the dots of my big boobs with estrogen-dominant...so there ya go :)  )
TwoXChromosomes X I have it 24/7 too, it's been that way for years. Not gushing but definitely noticeable throughout the day. If you don't have an infection (so no abnormal smell or itching) then don't worry too much.   Some people wear those super thin pantyliners every day for absorbency, but I think that would be expensive over time, plus creating a lot of waste, so if you aren't bothered by wiping it up then that's probably a good thing. Otherwise you could always have a change of underwear on hand (maybe for when you're at work since at home it's easier to just run to the bathroom whenever) or try reusable pads, they're pretty comfy and you won't be spending money on box after box of pantyliners.  As juliastrange said, it'll change throughout your life (or at least it CAN, I don't know if it does for everyone), so maybe one day you'll find yourself with less! Until then, just know that it's normal. And if you're really concerned you can always ask your gynecologist, of course. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was diagnosed at 17. (by laparoscopy) I was on Depo Lupron for a long time. It basically took away my periods. I didn't come off of it until I was ready to have kids. After the kids, it was still so bad that I had a thermal ablation. Sounds to me like shopping around for a better gynecologist might be in order! Hugs... I have felt your pain, and I am sorry you are going through it. 
TwoXChromosomes X On top of that, she got pregnant, so...do you think she's using birth control? (I realize her birth control method may have failed and resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, but bear with me.) If she's not using it, then birth control had nothing to do with her choice of partner! 
BabyBumps X As far as job protection, that would fall under the FMLA laws (covers when you need to take care of yourself or a loved one, including STD).   I don't think this would apply here, unfortunately. She only just began her job and FMLA doesn't kick in until you have been an employee for a year. Also, it only applies to employers with more than either 45 or 50 employees (can't remember the exact number). So, unless she works for a large daycare company with multiple facilities (so as to employ at least the minimum number of people for FMLA to apply), it is not applicable in this case.
Parenting X Lets see;  Risk of Circumcising;   All surgical procedures have risks. Problems after circumcision are not common. Minor problems are short-term and may include:      Oozing or slight bleeding from the surgical site.     Infection of the circumcision site or at the opening to the urethra.     Irritation of the exposed tip of the penis (glans) as a result of contact with stool or urine.  Long-term minor problems can include: .     Damage to the opening of the urethra, which leads from the bladder to the tip of the penis (meatal stenosis).     Scarring of the penis from infection or surgical error. For example:         The entire foreskin may not be removed, leaving portions of it attached to the penis (skin bridge). This may cause pain during erection.         Scar tissue can grow outward toward the tip of the penis from the cut edge of the foreskin. Repeat surgery on the penis may be required to improve appearance or to allow normal passage of urine if the opening from the bladder has been blocked by this scar tissue.         The outer skin layer (or layers) of the penis may be removed accidentally.         An opening that is too small for the foreskin to retract over the penis (phimosis) can happen if too little foreskin is removed.  Major problems are very rare but can include:      A complete removal of the skin covering the shaft of the penis, causing the penis to appear to have been completely surgically removed.     Too much bleeding. Stitches may be needed to stop the bleeding.     Serious, life-threatening bacterial infection.     Partial or full removal (amputation) of the tip of the penis.  Risk of not circing; Though the American Academy of Pediatrics has repeatedly stated that "there is no absolute medical indication for routine circumcision of the newborn," it has been shown that uncircumcised men have a higher incidence of urinary tract infections, sexually-transmitted diseases, and cancer of the penis than circumcised men.  Penile cancer - Penile cancer accounts for less than 1% of all malignancies in men in the USA and 0.1% of cancer deaths, the 5-year survival rate being approx. 50% [American, 2005a]. Mortality rate is 25-33%.  In 1996 male breast cancer amounted to 1,400 cases, with 260 deaths, you have a better chance of breast cancer.  Not ALL boys are fine either way.  
TwoXChromosomes X It's actually been fairly constant for the past two years. Nightmare. All the symptoms. Life sucks! Lots of hormonal emotion. They have given me cyclokapron a few times to stop it for a few days when i am going on hols or something but I don't like to take that too much. They have put me on the pill along with Implanon for a couple months to see if that reset things, but all that happened was a period worse than anything ever experienced once I took a break. I thought I was hemorrhaging. So now I am going to give up on Implanon and get a mirena. Hoping that will sort everything. 
TwoXChromosome X -get.html  If you click the "Low Hormone Birth Control" section it tells you it has 25 mcg of estrogen, which is really low, but not as low as progestin-only pills (which have no estrogen).
TwoXChromosomes X I've had anxiety about going to the doctor on and off since forever. The last time I had a gyn exam I burst into tears a minute after the (female) doctor entered the room. She gave me a box of tissues, comforted me, listened to my anxieties, and then when I was composed went on with the appt, explaining everything and going slowly. Most doctors are compassionate people and are there to help you and make you comfortable. So, don't worry, it'll be ok and the exam isn't even that bad. 
BabyBumps X I've been so lucky thus far with the usual pregnancy discomforts (aside from morning sickness, but I navigated that pretty smoothly too!) that I probably would feel like other pregnant ladies should hate me everywhere if nothing kicked in at all. Thanks for the reassurance and good wishes.
TwoXChromosomes X  HPV is, &amp; has always been, life long. Certain forms can lay dormant, but this still makes the person a carrier. Others may only have symptoms once. These symptoms could consist of genital warts. The person may not flare right away, or they may flare on a regular basis. Other forms of HPV that don't cause genital warts could cause Cervical Cancer in women.  Edit: This is the information I've been given as a carrier. I've never heard of a way to rid of my virus. I have heard of it lying dormant, but the virus still exist, along with a chance of CC.   Edit2: I researched. The brochures I have say otherwise, but this link says your body can treat the disease with it's immune system within 2 years.   - -hpv.htm  Thank you all for the information. I'll be the first to admit I was wrong.
BabyBumps X It sounds like you just received your period, but you should try another test in a few days just to be sure. I have been so stressed that it has completely shut down my period and I missed one. So there is a good chance you are just having a light period.  I had implantation bleeding that I thought was my period. I woke up and there was a small amount of blood, but in the morning there was nothing. I though maybe stress was messing up my cycle so I didn't think much of it. I still had small cramps like I do in the begining of my cycle but no more bleeding. I took a test a week later and it was positive. Then I went to the doctor to have a blood test to confirm but I had other symptoms by then so I knew I was pregnant, it was just nice to be 100% sure.
Parenting X I'm in Canada and don't know what Midwifery is like in the states.  Here the midwives complete four years of college/university and apprentice with a practicing midwife.  They have access to medication to control bleeding in the event of hemorrhage and have privileges in certain hospitals.  They can set up IVs and such too.   I did a lot of research and decided that, for me, homebirth was a good option.  I am low risk, had zero prenatal issues, am on no medication and have no complicating health problems.  I am also less than 20 minutes from 4 different hospitals and live down the street from a fire hall and police station....so first responders are not far if 911 is called.  I also had a two midwives present with years of experience.  I would have considered a birth centre if that was an option, but there are none in my city.  Had there been any complications, I would have been transferred to hospital immediately.  My daughter was born in my bedroom and while I did hemorrhage, the midwives were quick to form a plan and act and had every intention of calling the hospital had their initial intervention not stopped the bleeding as quickly as it did.  I was never in any danger with them present.  My midwife had a client give birth in hospital, hemorrhage worse than I did and it took almost 20 minutes to find the doctor on duty and longer for her to make it up to the room.  I really don't feel like the "help is right there" is necessarily true in every hospital at all times.  Since my daughter was born on a Sunday, it would have been severely reduced staff too.  I've also read a horror story of a family who lost their child due to gross negligence on the part of the midwives who didn't take into account a known health issue that required a simple intervention that was only available at the hospital.  The father blamed home birth...but it was very clear that the midwives were at fault, as the woman should never have been attempting a home birth in the first place.  So having a trustworthy care provider is extremely important.  Anyways.  I am planning another homebirth, barring complications of course, with another team of excellent midwives.  The most important thing is for a woman to give birth where she is most comfortable, if that's a hospital then that's where she should be.  TL;DR: Yes.  I have and will again...but it's not for everyone or every pregnancy.
BabyBumps X I had given it brief thought when I became pregnant with my son.  With my daughter before it had never crossed my mind.  But I decided I'd rather be in the hospital for that just in case factor and in the end, I wouldn't have been able to have a home birth anyway - I had a low platelet count.  But because I had low platelets also meant I couldn't have an epidural so I ended up giving birth without any pain meds - the gas mask did nothing for me.  After giving birth o-naturel in the hospital, if I ever get pregnant again, I'm going to be giving home birth very serious consideration.
Parenting X It's about normalization and acceptance in our society. Moms will generally be less successful with breastfeeding if they are made to feel uncomfortable for it, and this is much more likely to happen in public. 
BabyBumps X Definitely active times and less active times. Although, as soon as I think "hmm...haven't felt the baby move today..." is when I get a solid kick to the spleen.
Parenting X Immediate cord clamping/cutting can deprive the baby of up to 1/3 its blood supply, so while jaundice is a very slight risk regardless, I'd prefer my child have their entire blood supply.
TwoXChromosomes X Yay! I hope it goes well for you, but give it several cycles, even if you don't like it at first. I did a ton of research before I purchased my MeLuna cups (2 because weird period, some super light days, some crushingly heavy), and spent SO long browsing Etsy for the perfect pads. I still wasn't prepared for cup usage...  First cycle with cup and reusable pads: I did NOT get my cup... found out I didn't understand my cervix. Bonus: understanding my cervix made me realize why sometime tampons worked, sometimes they didn't (cervix is low, I was inserting at the wrong angle). Reusable pads are incredible! Emptying cup and reinserting was like a slasher movie in my vag, pads make everything ok.  2nd cycle, prepared like a boss... except I still didn't get that my cervix traveled, and my flow really changed between days, so I had a ton of leaks. Reusable pads still amazing (never got any stains on undies), but cup emptying was like the elevator scene in 'The Shining'. Insertion was still hit or miss.  3rd cycle. Oh, yeah I get it now... only leaks are because my flow is insane for two days- need to empty largest size cup every 3-4 hours, as long as I watch the time, things are cool, go over 4 hours, and Kubrik is in my undies again. Reusable pads still awesome, but I just noticed that sometimes the snap catches in the seam of may pants while I walk.  Tl:dr- Cups take some time to get used to, stick with it.
TwoXChromosomes X The mirena is the worst thing every invented. I still had the crazy long periods AND the most painful cramping. And then the damn thing fell out.
Parenting X It's unfortunate they're giving such a one-sided stance.  We had a midwife and took a midwifery-geared prenatal class run by a woman who had been a doula for a couple decades.  She didn't badger us into not using medications, but she educated us on the importance of using them appropriately...like don't get an epidural after an hour or you've used up the most powerful pain-management in your arsenal; try a variety of other pain-management techniques and if you've been in labour so long that you're exhausted then get the epidural and try to rest for a while.  Stuff like that.  I think my hubby found the class really helpful...I basically just nodded through everything, since I'm comforted by being extremely well informed....so everything they went over was old news.
TwoXChromosomes X I've used the diva for years and now using a lunette. I think the shape is a bit better, a bit more comfortable and easier to get in I think
Parenting X yes!! I defnitely learned a lot from my class. The class taught us different pain management techniques, pushing strategies and positions, and answered all sorts of pregnancy and birthing related questions. The class we took didn't teach us what to do with the baby after we left the hospital, so that would be where your mom the "baby wizard" will help! 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I felt it was easier to get in, too. With the divacup I'd have to wiggle it a bit to get it to pop open, but the lunette is stiffer so it popped open on its own. I suspect it'll be more comfortable, but the jury is out until my next shark week.
BabyBumps X those chewable kid's vitamins work well as a prenatal if you take 2 instead of 1. i had the hardest time with prenatals because they tend to smell very strongly, and they would make me nauseous or i would gag trying to swallow the massive pills. i tried gummies for awhile but got sick of those too, so eventually switched to the chewables on my OB's advice. 
TwoXChromosomes X My husband and son are both uncircumcised.  I was warned when I chose not to have my son's done that it was going to be a nightmare to keep clean and risk of infections etc.  Regular bathing pretty much eliminates any of that.    More sensation is a definite plus and it's like a little penis blanket to keep them warm.  =P  
TwoXChromosomes X Whatever you do - wash your work clothes in Woolite, etc on delicates/cold cycle! And dry gently. Helps my stuff last longer - even if it is a H&amp;M/Target purchase. Also, I sometimes luck out at Goodwill, but I have better luck at consignment stores. Happy shopping!  
Parenting X I would recommend a birthing class to anyone who is a first time parent. I was an EMT when my wife and I had our first child and came out of the class with knowledge that was not given to me in training on how to assist in and emergency delivery. I don't believe that any birth will/could go to plan but it's always a good idea to get information about what can and will happen.   We also had a lot of family with new babies that were willing to give us information/advice but nothing compared to a structured laid out plan to deliver needed information. 
Parenting X Want a non-horror birth story? Mine was easy as pie. Seriously. The only hiccup I had was the 1st epidural didn't take so I needed another. I wasn't in "labor" for 36 hours, I wasn't miserable. I went in at 7am to be induced. Started the drip at 7:30-8am, epidural 1 around noon, epidural 2 around 4, started pushing at 9pm. STOPPED pushing at 930 because the doctor wasn't there (apparently they okayed me to start thinking I'd be pushing for 3 or more hours.) and my son was delivered at like 9:47 at night. Easiest thing ever. We watched tv most the day. Christmas shows mostly since my husband couldn't complain about what I wanted to watch! :)   The worst part of my whole birthing experience was that my first after birth meal was cold. Seriously. Not every birth is a horror story, don't let anyone scare you. Be ready for anything, but just because bad things can happen, doesn't mean it will. Also, don't believe the "you'll forget the pain when you hold your baby" crap. I didn't have a long period of pain, but I had it. I remember it. I can promise though you'll decide it's worth it. 
AskWomen X A lot of ladies are taught by their mothers to throw tampons down the toilet.  Unfortunately unlike TP, tampons are very hard on the drainage system and can clog it severely.  Tampons should be put into the garbage bin or that little box thing you see next to the toilet with some kind of "lady business" label affixed.
TwoXChromosomes X Try turning it a bit while it's inside you, and work your fingers up so you can slip a finger in between the top and your vaginal wall. You need to be able to break the seal before you pull it out.
TwoXChromosomes X A yeast infection usually causes itching and irritation around the vagina and inner labia. It is often accompanied by a whitish discharge that you might notice when wiping after going to the bathroom. It is usually indicated by itching around the opening of your vagina and inner labia, and sometimes a burning/stinging when you pee. You don't seem to have to most common symptoms for a yeast infection. Are you on antibiotics for something else? Yeast infections and antibiotics go hand-in-hand, because the antibiotics kill the bacteria that keep the fungi in check.  Are they little bumps like razor burn? Have you recently switched soaps or detergent? Have you since stepped up your hygiene routine to see if that helps? Maybe consider stopping the Monistat powder for a time, it may be irritating to you and be making things worse.  If you don't already, wear cotton undies and wash thoroughly daily to minimize the risk/exacerbation of any chafing. A little sprinkle of mild baby powder in the crotch of your undies can help ward off swamp ass if the conditions warrant it.  It isn't ever a bad idea to see a gynecologist, if not just to have a routine checkup.
TwoXChromosomes X Try squatting while removing it. Try it in the shower if you're afraid of spillage. When you squat you shorten your vagina so it's easier to grasp
Parenting X *sigh* I cant be the only person who thought "who would breastfeed a nazi?"  still. the whole taboo around breastfeeding in public is ridiculous... but I do think we are progressing. In the UK it's now illegal to ask a woman not to breastfeed in a public place.
Parenting X The hospital classes are typically *not* worth it.    However, definitely try to take a childbirth class.  Bradley, hypnobabies, etc. - the techniques are very helpful and will help you feel so prepared on what to expect and how to manage your pain, even if you're planning to get an epidural.    Also, you should try to attend La Leche League now while you're still pregnant.  Meetings are free.  
TwoXChromosomes X DIVA CUP RULEZZZZZ!!  I've had mine for almost 10 years I think.  no, seriously. just imagine how much $$ I've saved on tampons. it's insane.  edit: I just had to add--you're technically supposed to replace them more often than that. but mine is very clean and I've never had a problem with it leaking or anything, so I never saw a need to replace it.
TwoXChromosomes X Sea sponge tampons!! They're SO COMFORTABLE that you can't even feel them, and they last for ages. No irritating bleach, and they're as clean as you make them (I never trusted tampons to be clean).   I heard diva cups were best suited for those who have given vaginal birth, so if anyone would like to better educate me, I'm all for it. I was waiting until then before I started using one, but that'll be years from now.
BabyBumps X You're likely just lucky!  I didn't have nausea with my daughter; this time I was nauseous for 3 months but didn't get sick once.  It's really hard not to be paranoid!  Congratulations!
BabyBumps X took me something like 2 days after I lost my mucous plug to start having regular contractions, as an anecdote.  However, it could be tonight, or a week from now. No one can say!  All the best to you both... or all three!
BabyBumps X My boobs were pretty sore and I had a month of exhaustion at the beginning, but other than that I've never had symptoms. You know, except for the giant belly and the thing wiggling around inside.
TwoXChromosomes X Oh God, as a fellow eczema sufferer I feel your pain, and itchiness.  Want to know a really weird secret? Apparently most eczema is caused by an immune overreaction to the candida yeast (same one that causes athletes foot, jock itch, female yeast infections) getting a bit overgrown on the skin.  Doctors would always just prescribe me corticosteroids, which killed the symptoms but did nothing for the underlying issue.  After discovering the bit about the yeast, I picked up some nizoral and lotrimin (anti-fungal shampoo and athletes foot cream). I use the nizoral as a general body wash and spot treat any little flares with the lotrimin.  No major flares in years. There's been a few attempts, but the nizoral stops it in its tracks every time.  Hope you get some relief.
TwoXChromosomes X You don't have any real periods on birth control, you just bleed in reaction to withdrawing the hormones. The "periods" you have on birth control do not serve the physical purpose of actual periods.   However, when you start taking birth control for extended periods of time, you might have unscheduled bleeding for several months. don't worry about it, and know that the effect will pass for most women. Eventually, you'll figure out what your tolerance for how many months you can take continuously is: some women will consistently experience breakthrough bleeding at 3 months, others will not at over a year.   What my first doctor recommended to me years ago, and what has worked for me, has been using regular birth control (not seasonique or whatever) with less and less placebo weeks. She suggested I start the first month with a normal pack with a week's break, then take two consecutive packs with no breaks followed by a week's break, then three consecutive packs with no breaks followed by a break, then four, then five, and so on. I haven't had significant breakthrough bleeding in years and years on BC. I switched from the pill to nuvaring years ago, same method, and now use it 100% continuously with no breaks whatsoever. 
TwoXChromosomes X Most types of BC can be used to do this, however, since you're most likely to have unscheduled bleeding when you first start to take BC, it's generally a good idea to start skipping "periods"/withdrawal bleeds before your vacation or wedding or whatever so your body has some time to adjust. 
BabyBumps X I felt my little girl at 14+4 and I nearly flipped. It was probably one of the happiest moments in my life. Then I spent the next 6 weeks waiting for it to be strong enough so my husband could feel her.   Of course we had also lost three babies by that point so feeling this first baby move was BIG. 
Parenting X Similar here, though I never found out what clogged ours. I didn't know we had a clog unti water started coming up out of the shower and toilet while the washer was draining. I got one plumber out who snaked the main waste pipe and then said he couldn't do anything else, and the second guy came out with a powered snake kind of thing and broke it up. Cost me over $300.
Parenting X If she's just 37 weeks today then they probably wont even start considering the date until her appointment next week.  My doc told me they'd induce me at 40 weeks, so at my 40 week appointment we set up the induction for a few days later.  Thankfully  my little guy came the night before the induction was scheduled lol
TwoXChromosomes X I usually dump mine in the shower.  But I'm also so light that I really don't have to dump more than once a day (although, if i'm going to do yoga in the middle of the week when i'm heaviest then I usually empty it just as a precaution).  I am in love with my cup, recommend it to anyone that will listen to me.
BabyBumps X Congrats! I didn't have any morning sickness during this pregnancy, and I'm 17 weeks along now. My mom also said she had no morning sickness with me or my brother so maybe you're just one of the lucky ones.
TwoXChromosomes X I have an IUD. It's a Paragard so it's not hormonal, which is one of the things that attracted me to it in the first place. Everyone reacts to hormones differently, and hormones and I did not get along very well. The thing I really love about the Paragard is that it's pretty much impossible for me to do something to mess up my birth control. I don't have to remember to take a pill every day, worry about how different medications will affect it, etc. The only thing I need to remember to do is take it out when my ten years with it is up.   Some things aren't so great about it. It can cause increased bleeding and more painful cramping. I have noticed this. I've also noticed that it's gotten better with time as my body has adjusted. I would now say that my bleeding has returned to pre-IUD levels, and cramping is only slightly increased.  There is also a hormonal IUD that you can look into. That has the added benefit of shorter, lighter periods. Ultimately, it will have to come down to what is best for you. While I love having an IUD, it may not be the best for everyone. Good luck with your decision.
TwoXChromosomes X In all honesty, you should be fine. But if you're on a low-dose pill (anything with -lo at the end, some don't specify that in the name, but you can look up online whether yours is low-dose or not), you're chances of spotting while skipping your placebo week are fairly high. It has to do with the fact that they have less hormones in them. Also, it's recommended that you have 4 periods a year to remain fertile, so don't skip your period more than two cycles in a row! Hope this helps :)
TwoXChromosomes X As a girl whose never used a cup before, it sounds like some crazy gymnastics are needed to get one in properly. I know they're soft and all, but is it possible say, for the seal around the edge of the cup and your vaginal wall to not be totally sealed, thus leaking? 
Parenting X I was kidding before but yeah, they do ask you when you go in for a pregnancy how many you've had before. It's probably the same for the abortion clinics. I imagine it's pretty accurate because why would someone lie about having carried previous pregnancies to term? I can see people lying about abortions but not so much live children.
TwoXChromosomes X My mom has lupus as well and my former rheumatologist believed that I had mild pediatric lupus that developed into SLE after my pregnancy with my son. I hate flares. It seems now flares trigger everything now and it's a constant battle just to get out of bed.
TwoXChromosomes X You're supposed to pee within 30 minutes after having sex to clean out your urinary tract, but seeing as you're having sex on a daily basis, you might want to take either a urinary tract health supplement or a cranberry supplement too.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine has always been irregular.  The paraguard should have no effect since it is hormone free.  Have you checked for the string?  
Parenting X Have you read the research?  Low risk home births with a qualified midwife are as safe or safer than hospital births.  And most of that research is including either accidental home births or unattended homebirths.  If you only count the planned attended ones, I'm certain the research will in time show that home birth (in the US at least) is consistently safer.  Hospitals bring all their own risks.  You are basing your opinion on your personal experience, which is biased, not on the actual statistics.
Parenting X I had a home birth with a midwife for my first.  36 hour labor, 2 hours 20 minutes of pushing, never a sign of any fetal distress, and a very healthy energetic 10 pound 1 ounce baby boy who nursed immediately and effectively.  It was intense, overwhelming, extremely difficult, and great.  I trust my midwife completely (I couldn't have done it at home if I didn't) and I plan to do it again for #2 in February.    I would say 4 out of 5 friends who had a hospital birth believe that the hospital saved their or their baby's life.  I truly believe that most of those life threatening situations either weren't life threatening, or were caused by the hospital environment and practices themselves.    I'm a member of a mom's group.  The 8 moms in my group have had 14 planned home births with a midwife all together.  Of the 14 kids, 12 were born at home with no serious complications.  During 2 of the births the midwife had concerns and decided it would be best to go to the hospital.  Both transported in their own cars, not emergencies.  One went on to have a totally natural birth and the other had an epidural and forceps.  That 13 out of 14 born drug free.  14 out of 14 born vaginally and 14 out of 14 able to breastfeed.  Granted that is a very small sample, but you never see those kind of statistics in a hospital, even with low risk births.  At least in the US, our hospitals have a lot of work to do to improve care.    I encourage every low risk mom to consider a home birth with a midwife because I truly believe that it is safer for mom and baby.  Research shows it to be as safe or safer than a hospital birth if you are low risk and have a qualified midwife, and most of that research includes either unattended home births or unplanned home births.  When we get better data on actual planned attended home births, I am sure the stats will show low risk attended home birth to be far safer than hospital birth, in the US at least.
BabyBumps X yeah, i've basically heard not to bring anything you're not willing to see stained/ruined because of bleeding. heck, don't a lot of hospitals provide you with those socks that have the grips on the bottom? i've also heard some even provide some kind of mesh underwear for you so you don't have to ruin your own undies.
TwoXChromosomes X Arguing that people don't have souls renders your argument null to the religious folk, just like arguing that people do have souls renders their argument null to you.   For me, legality isn't about what's right or wrong; it's about what we want to spend money prosecuting. Adultery, lying and being rude are all bad things, but they're not illegal because people who cheat, lie and cut in line aren't necessarily dangerous to society. In my mind, abortion is another in the long line of things that aren't good, but do not represent a clear and present danger to society.   And I'm religious. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X The truth is that conservative selection of sexual partners is the best way to avoid STDs.  Actually, the best way to avoid STDs is to not have sex at all. Your committed partner could have HPV or something and not even know it. Even marriage is no protection. Next thing you know you could get cancer and die. So I just dont think having sex at all is the smartest thing to do. Whats your opinion on that?
BabyBumps X Here is the list I started for myself last week:  jammies  going home clothes (me)  extra socks  ugly panties (like 5-10 that can be thrown away after, because apparently you won't want to keep them, ick)  hairbrush and elastics  makeup and jewelery (because I want to look decent for the first pics)  shampoo and soap  toothbrush and toothpaste  camera and batteries  baby book  phone and charger  netbook and cord  nook and charger  SD card reader  big super-absorbent maxi pads  going home outfit (baby)  an extra sleeper  a few receiving blankets  extra blanket and/or pillow for me (recommended by some local doulas)  
BabyBumps X I think my midwives only weighed me like...two times, lol  Honestly, they weren't at all concerned with how much weight I was gaining as long as the baby was growing and healthy.
BabyBumps X A camera, phone charger, hair ties, lanolin, a stretchy nursing bra, and conditioner.   Aside from that, well, clothes for you and the baby to go home in, and a change of clothes for dad; some snacks. My hospital provided shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, mesh underwear, pads, etc.
BabyBumps X I never really felt my babies drop.  I -thought- my belly looked lower at some point, but never did I have that sudden relief or sudden feeling of...anything.  So yeah, just ask your doctor or midwife and of course, contact them immediately if you think you're in labour :)
TwoXChromosomes X A little late, but I hope this helps. Cranberry pills work for me, I used to get UTIs frequently since I was 9, I guess I'm just prone to it. I'm 21 now, last year I started taking cranberry pills and I haven't had a serious UTI in a year. Cranberry juice also helps (make sure you buy the one without sugar because bacteria feeds on sugar). I took natural remedies because doctors don't really solve the problem. I've been to several doctors and all they do is give me antibiotics which throws my pH level off and causes a yeast infection :/.  But of course you should go to the doctor just to make sure the bacteria hasn't reached your kidneys. 
BabyBumps X Since I don't live in the USA I can onnly say to you, what I heard: They should be as reliable as the ones you do to confirm a pregnancy at your doctors. You could look at the hcg level needed for the test to become positive (lower -&gt; earlier positive result)
BabyBumps X No.  I had unexplained elevated HCG levels earlier in my pregnancy.  Combined with other indicators, high HCG can be an indicator of Down Syndrome.  It's one of the levels that is checked the the Quad Screen.  However, during my 12 week ultrasound, everything looked so good that my risk of having a baby with Downs was about 1 in 5,000 (very low).  So, it seems that the hormone level was unrelated to that in my case.    Are they going to run more tests?  Has she had the ultrasound screening?  They look at some features like the nasal bones and an area in the back of the neck to try to determine if a baby has characteristics of Downs.    
TwoXChromosomes X Oh, good.  I was going to comment "LUBE IT, GIRLFRIEND!" but am comforted to know that this simple fix didn't elude you entirely.  For me, sex was uncomfortable the first few times I had it because of the same reason.  Now, if I go without sex for more than a week or two, it starts all over again.  I second having some drinks before hand (don't get drunk!) and doing anything that will relax your muscles and mind while stimulating you otherwise (wink).  Once it becomes comfortable, do it often.  :)  Something that may help is different positions.  When it's been a while for my husband and I, it's almost always less painful with him behind me.  If all else fails, saddle up and face him, that way you can control how deep/how fast/the angle/etc.
BabyBumps X I've read in numerous forums that false positives happen a lot with the quad screen, and my doctor doesn't even recommend getting the test done unless you are at risk, since there are so many false-positives.    Worst case scenario is that you have a more invasive test done (as pointed out by realshygirl), such as an amniocentesis, which also carries a super small risk of miscarriage. :(
BabyBumps X Yup! Totally normal.   With regard to strange side-effects, this is the only book I bought" [The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy]( -Clinic-Guide-Healthy-Pregnancy/dp/0060746378_) I recommend it because it breaks down the entire pregnancy week-by-week, tells you what is happening with your baby, with you, what the side-effects likely to appear that month are, what's normal, when to get worried, etc. It's actual, factual, medical, non-opinionated advice, which I really appreciate.   [This]( -week-by-week/MY00331) is basically an online version of most of the information in the book, and a great resource as well.  
TwoXChromosomes X What about wearing a super light panty-liner? Especially if you get cramps before the dam breaks. 
BabyBumps X I had diarrhea a for a couple of weeks before I actually went into labour. I lost my mucous plug on the saturday and went into labour on monday. I'd had irregular braxton hicks for a couple of weeks.   The morning I woke up in labour, I had a feeling, but I wasn't sure for about an hour until I realised my 'BH' were coming at regular intervals, and had a bit of mild period cramp pain associated.  It felt like waves coming over me instead of just random tight feelings. I was 39w1d.   Could be soon, could kick in later. I had a pretty "textbook" labour according to my midwife, so I didn't spend more than a few hours with regular contractions before going into "active" labour. Some women spend a few days before it gets serious.   Obviously you're at term though, so it could be anytime.  Good luck! Have faith in your body and yourself :)
Parenting X Most of us who desire natural births want the baby's health to be top priority.  Less medical interventions are usually much safer.  (Epidurals have a lot of risks, as do chemical inductions and c-sections.)  I did have a c-section, after 30 hours of natural (unmedicated) labor.  It was very disappointing to have the surgery, but my baby went into distress.  And all that mattered was my baby's health!  There will always be people who go to extremes.  But for doctors to say that you can't request a natural labor, that you CAN'T use Bradley Method, that you MUST NOT question the doctor's decisions, etc...that is for their own convenience and ego.  A good doctor discusses options with you, and attempts to meet all your needs when possible.  I had an amazing nurse-midwife with the first birth, who had to hand me off to a doctor last minute.  With my second labor, I had a jerk doctor who demanded I have an epidural if I wanted to try for a VBAC.  He told me he didn't want a "hysterical woman" on his table.  I felt like I had no say, no choice, because he was the only one who'd consider my VBAC.  (This was in Jersey, where VBAC's are actively discouraged.)  In the end, he said I was taking too long and needed a c-section.  It was hour 7 of my labor, which he had *induced*.  I got so pissed off that I ended up pushing the baby out two minutes later.  The next day he told me he'd never really thought I'd have the VBAC, and that I'd "impressed him" with my stamina because "most women couldn't do that."  Fucking ego.  Lying to me, doing whatever he wanted without regard to my requests, and putting his own strange misogynistic opinions ahead of legitimate medical practice.  My VBAC was less empowering than my c-section.  WTF? 
Parenting X If you are considering medication for your morning sickness, I'm going to guess it's pretty bad... like puking all day every day.   If this is not the case and you are just tired of puking on the way to work (I did it), have you tried moving your prenatal vitamins to the evening instead of morning and/or changing brands?  Sometimes the extra iron in them can make people sick. I moved taking mine to the evening and stopped getting sick almost immediately. I still felt nauseous all day, but at least I wasn't puking!
TwoXChromosomes X On the rag. Haha.  No, I just say it's either "that time of the month" or that I'm on my period.
TwoXChromosomes X I just wanted to let you know that I headed to the ER at 6am yesterday because of another excrutiating attack. I was given pain killers and I managed to convince the doctor to do an ultrasound on my gallbladder because I had all the symptoms. Well, turns out I had a ton of large stones. By 3pm I was rushed into surgery. I have 4 very small incisions and I'm so, so happy it is over. Even now that I am still sore from surgery, I feel 100% better.    Thank you for your advice!
TwoXChromosomes X I've had a Mirena for six years now, it's wonderful.  No more cramps, and I only get a few days of spotting a couple times a year.  I hope yours works just as well.
BabyBumps X Good luck! I just wanted to say (and I know it doesn't happen this way for everyone) but I lost a TON of plug, and my water broke 24 hours later. I was 38 weeks exactly when my daughter was born.
TwoXChromosomes X A hematoma is not a blood clot, it's just sort of a deep tissue bruise or internal bleeding. Blood clots are called a thrombus or thrombosis when it starts to occlude blood flow ie. Deep vein thrombosis. 
Parenting X In a couple of weeks you'll be in the newborn phase. This is just adjustment time. Heal. Ask for help-- demand it, beg, whatever. You deserve it. I'm never been so selfish as when I just give birth-- it's me and the baby, as the center of the universe.   In a couple of weeks you'll feel like you will survive-- and you will. Then just enjoy it. 7 years later, I look back on the newborn phase as the easiest, the most joyful. I didn't have to go to work, I could ignore the housework, and the baby was endless entertainment. I remember the sleep deprivation and physical discomfort bothering me at the time, but they were a small price to pay for the first 3 months with the babies.   Good luck, and congratulations! 
Parenting X Already did one birthing class, waterbirth class still to come.  We couldn't take a Bradley class, as not enough people signed up and it's not offered again before our due date.  We elected to hire a doula instead.
TwoXChromosomes X The day of insertion I felt pretty good, I had ubercramps at random for the first monthish I had it, many of them were BUTTHOLE-CLENCHING-STOP-YOU-IN-YOUR-TRACKS-MY-UTERUS-IS-ABOUT-TO-FALL-OUT-OF-MY-BODY cramps like nothing I've ever experienced before.  Then one day it stopped and all was well. HOORAY PARAGARD
TwoXChromosomes X when I had my mirena inserted I took a ton of pain killers beforehand, it still really hurt getting it inserted! but the cramping in the 2-3 hours after were not too bad. That night though I had massive cramps, but it all settled down the next day. I still cramp a lot now but but just from an insertion point of view 2 days and I was fine :)
Parenting X "We" think it's fine, since of course I'm able to speak for everyone on Reddit.  No adverse effects have ever been found for light drinking during pregnancy.  In fact, even for mothers that spend their entire pregnancy drunk, usually they get through pregnancy and have normal children.  Fetal alcohol syndrome isn't that common compared to the number of alcoholic mothers in the world.  Fetal damage from alcohol is estimated at something like 1/10th of one percent, overall.  Alcoholism - serious addiction to alcohol - affects something like 2% of women.  So even among alcoholic mothers, who canNOT go more than a few days without heavy drinking, 19 out of 20 of them are going to deliver a child that has no observable damage from alcohol.  And the 20th one is going to damage her child with alcohol.  If you're not an alcoholic you are not going to harm your fetus from the kind of "one drink a day" or "half a drink a day" type of drinking that is (usually) socially acceptable for pregnant women.  However, there is a substantial population of ignorant individuals who may feel that they know better than you what you should do during pregnancy, so be prepared for rudeness from strangers. 
BabyBumps X Lucky, I wish I could still masturbate regularly. I HATE the contractions that happen with orgasm. So uncomfortable, it totally kills the pleasure for me :c
TwoXChromosomes X The copper IUDs last longer than the Mirena/hormone IUDs.  I can leave my copper Flexi-T in for up to 10 years but my doctor recommended getting it changed after 5-7 years.  I guess it's up to the patient.
BabyBumps X You're now into the second trimester, so assuming your foetus has a heartbeat and is showing a proper growth rate, the bleeding (if it has stopped) is most likely nothing to worry about.  Your dates being a week or so out aren't really an issue, seeing as hardly anyone gives birth on their calculated due date.  Measurements also vary greatly, you will note how they take multiple measurements at your scans, and even then they are often given as +/- a certain number of days of accuracy.  Bleeding is actually very common, and while it should always be checked out (and while bright red is often but not always a bad sign) it sounds like you're fine if your doctor isn't worried.  Very early in a pregnancy it's impossible to give much of a verdict off a single scan (unless the dates are certain due to IVF, or similar).  Even if it looks like nothing's happening, you need - and should insist - on a follow up scan before accepting that a pregnancy is unviable.  Certain phenomena, such a pole that measures far less than it should compared to the sac measurement, are usually a fairly clear indication that things aren't progressing properly, but a repeat scan is still critical.  Weird things and medical "miracles" do happen.
AskWomen X I've tried this and find that women rarely know what they like, but if you pay attention to body language you can usually figure it out fairly quickly.    What I find effective is to have your arm around her waist (or thighs depending on your positioning :) ) because you can feel when she relaxes or tenses up.  Relaxing = keep doing it, tensing up = move on.  The relaxing and tensing is very slight but detectable.  Also, don't confuse pre-orgasm tensing up with her not liking what you are doing.  Another reason I don't like asking what she likes is because I find that it kills the mood.  Even asking in the sexiest way possible I find this happens.  It's definitely OK to have a post-sex debrief so you can know what to improve on, but asking what she wants in the heat of the moment is a sure boner killer in my experience.  It's also OK to talk about it before the "heat of the moment."  Sometimes I will text my wife and suggest a specific sexual activity.  One tip I would like to offer fellow males: be determined.  Some women take a long time to climax, but the whole experience will be more enjoyable for everyone if you are successful.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not anti-condom, but my life choices have always led me to be in a position that I didn't need them. Neither to avoid STDs, nor to avoid pregnancy.
BabyBumps X 25th percentile is the opposite of too big.  50th is average, and the scale goes up, not down.  I would imagine her doctor is more concerned with a small baby, but as long as the baby is staying the same percentile in subsequent ultrasounds then he/she is still growing, just petite, which isn't really a concern.
TwoXChromosomes X  I guess this differs from country to country:   &gt; [You should never flush tampons down the toilet as they may block the plumbing system. Your school and public toilets provide special sanitary bins, so wrap your used tampon in some toilet paper, and place it in the bin provided. If you cant find one of these special bins (you probably wont have one at home), dont fret, just wrap the tampon in toilet paper (or put it in a bag) and then pop it in the bin.]( ) 
TwoXChromosomes X oh I was just saying that because I hate cramps. Not having to change a pad or a tampon for a few hours is great, as well as not having to worry about bloody underwear, but I wish the damn cramps would just disappear.
TwoXChromosomes X Gentle suction and the muscles of your vaginal wall--it really doesn't budge.  Even if you bear down you can't extricate the thing without releasing the suction manually.  I promise, it cannot slide out if you get a size that fits you.
TwoXChromosomes X When you take it out, try folding the rim of the cup inside of itself.  If I just pull, or don't tuck the rim in enough, the cup is painful to take out.  Just reach your finger up over the rim and push it inside, and it should be pretty easy to take out!
TwoXChromosomes X In my experience, the cup has been way cleaner than using pads or tampons. You just dump it out in the toilet before you even look at it and then give it a rinse in the sink before putting it back in. And you only have to do that twice a day.. instead of dealing with pads/tampons every time you use the bathroom. Sometimes I forget I'm on my period when I'm using the cup.
TwoXChromosomes X You don't have periods on birth control, not a one. You have withdrawal bleeds from the cessation of hormones, or breakthrough bleeds because your body is feeling bitchy.   You had a withdrawal bleed because you went off the pill again, just like you do once a month. Your actual real period might come back next week, or next month. 
BabyBumps X It really does melt away. Even 4 days post-partum I was looking in the mirror wondering why I looked so damn good. I fully expected to look 6-months pregnant for at least a few weeks after giving birth.   Mind you, the last 10 lbs aren't as easy as the first 25, but it isn't much to fuss about. I figure between breastfeeding and walking everywhere holding my (currently) 15lb baby, I will stay reasonably unfat.
TwoXChromosomes X It sits fairly close to the opening and most have a stem. Mine has a little rubber ring and there's another that has a rubber ball. A lot also have grippy ridges around the base of the cup part and the material itself is fairly grippy. Basically, you barely poke your fingers up there, grab it, and pull. You might need to break the suction first by squeezing it or denting in the rim with a finger but that's it. Pull. It isn't water so it won't just slosh and spill out everywhere but you do it over the toilet anyway so it doesn't matter much even if it did spill. Wash your hands before and then wash your hands after.
TwoXChromosomes X Don't be scared:) I understand, though. The first time I had to have a pap smear done, I was 17 and FREAKED out because my family doctor performed it...he also happened to be the father of a good friend of mine. So it was just awkward all around. If it's the pain you're worried about, it's really not so bad. I know it hurts for some girls, but even the first time for me wasn't painful. It can definitely be....odd. But hopefully your doctor will see you're nervous and go very slowly and easily. Really though--if you relax your lady bits and breathe, the pain shouldn't be bad. (Just trying to let you know that all the gyno horror stories aren't really the norm..... at least I don't think they are!)
BabyBumps X Sounds pretty normal to me. I didn't gain much the first 3 months, maybe 3 pounds but I gained about 40 altogether by the end. 
BabyBumps X I didn't feel kicks with my first until about 23 weeks or something like that.  I'm not an obese person or anything like that.  I'm pregnant with my second, and I still didn't feel kicks until late.  I just don't feel them much.  With both pregnancies, my doctor/midwife asked me about counting kicks and if I feel 10 movements every 2 hours.  No, I don't.  I usually only feel kicks at night when I go to bed.  My son was perfectly healthy, and this second pregnancy is full term now.    You definitely will feel the kicks eventually, but it's still normal not to feel them now.  I bet in 2-3 weeks, you'll be feeling them all the time.
BabyBumps X I was constantly getting yelled at by my doctor for being underweight (5'8", 118 lbs) in my first trimester. Every time I would go in for an appointment, I either lost weight or only gained a pound or two. Then I went in a few weeks ago (at around 24 weeks pregnant) and BAM! I gained 7 lbs since the last visit. So no worries, maybe you wwill start to gain in the 2nd trimester. I've gained about 17 lbs total now and I'm 27 weeks. Try not to obsess about it til then, because I drove myself crazy forcing food in my face when I was nauseous and miserable. 
TwoXChromosomes X WARNING: Probable tmi.  I've had the paragard for about a year now, got it at PP for FREE!! My period output increased, it's a bit longer and my cramps are a bit worse - all by about 1/3 of what was once regular. All of this was much more intense the first few months and has lessened each cycle since as my body has adjusted.   The worst thing that happened to me was that for about the first 3 weeks I would endure cramping when changing from a sitting/standing position. Called PP and they said the IUD was still settling. Ugh.  If I'd had the opportunity, I would have gotten it while outside of a sexual relationship.
BabyBumps X This is my second pregnancy. I have had on and off morning sickness I am currently 30 weeks. This pregnancy has been so different from my last. I wasn't sick at all with the last one. 
TwoXChromosomes X In an effort to keep my thought succinct, here's my opinion:  I am pro-choice. A fetus should not be considered "alive" until it can survive outside the womb - with minimal medical assistance. Life, for me, begins at birth. 
TwoXChromosomes X It tends to happen to me with any of them. And it absolutely drives me crazy!! I don't have periods heavy enough to wear tampons, so I use the pantyliners ... But, I still suffer that uncomfortable feeling.  I tried an organic brand, and it was worse - so, I stick with the pantyliners ... UGH!!!! :-)
Parenting X Depends on what you want. Do YOU after fully being educated on the side effects, want an epidural or feel that YOU will find it necessary? Do you know of any non-medical pain relief options? Have you discussed things such as demerol availability, walking epidurals, laboring down, etc.  My friends swear by hypnobabies.  I personally just feel that labor is a bit like riding a bike up a steep hill when you're out of shape. It's intense but as long as you hunker down, take it slow, move with the task and BREATHE, it's actually rather awesome. 
TwoXChromosomes X So you can't get pregnant when taking placebo pills? Even when you haven't started your period yet?
TwoXChromosomes X Try some of the other awesome options, like reusable cloth pads/liners, menstrual cups, or sea sponge tampons. There are loads of options :)
TwoXChromosomes X  My girlfriend didn't menstruate for a year and a half on the 6 month cycle of the depo shot, and my roommate just spotted constantly for 6 months. So i guess it's kinda hit or miss. Also yes I would stop my period. I don't plan on getting pregnant and I don't sleep with men. My period is unusually painful, I believe. It's usually ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable for me, not to mention my hormones are a crazy bitch. 
TwoXChromosomes X I appreciate having my monthly period. Just a monthly reminder to keep taking my birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X Ladies! Learn about your body! I'm tired of telling everyone about how a cycle actually works. Ovulation week is 6 days before to a day after the day you ovulate. You should keep in mind there is a buffer zone for two reasons: 1. you do not ovulate the same exact day every month, 2. sperm can live inside a uterus for roughly 4 days. We also have to take into consideration the ratio of killer sperm to actual sperm. Killer sperm, which is about 80% of ejaculated sperm, seeks out and destroys actual sperm. There is no reason for this girl to have taken Plan B when she started her period the next day. All of you who don't know enough about your cycle and gave this girl advice, you just made her waste 50 bucks. The only way one could get pregnant this close to your period is she has a really off ovulation cycle.
TwoXChromosomes X I always used their liners but starting two periods ago it's felt like someone fucked me with poison ivy. It was miserable and it took me until the second period to figure it out. I switched to u by Kotex thin liners because I started using a cup as well and only need just a bit of protection.
TwoXChromosomes X I actually have stopped having my period using birth control. I take my loestrin continuously instead of taking the placebo pills. Totally approved by my doctor btw and you could probably talk to yours about it as well.  However, this does require placing a rather large amount of trust in your birth control. I absolutely make sure to take mine at the same time every day, adjusting for day light savings, time zone differences, and everything :P Also I pay very close attention to my body and if I notice any differences. That said, I have had a couple dreams where I'm one of the women on I'm pregnant and didn't know it, so there's that too. But so far, so good for 2+ years now!
TwoXChromosomes X I was on birth control for 17 years before I came off it (we wanted to try for a baby).  I'm not going to lie - it wasn't easy!  Nobody really talks about what it's like to come off the pill, but after taking artificial hormones for many years, your body does go through quite a bit.  In my case, I got really, really bloated - bloated like I have never been before.  I also got cramps and my periods were much, much heavier.  Things started to settle down after about 6 months or so, but it did take a while.  Everyone is different though so you might not go through this.  Best of luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I was on the pill for 18 years. The first few months being off BCP were pretty normal - my cycle was regular and it didn't seem like anything was different. Around the 3rd month everything changed - my cycle became completely unpredictable. I now get really bad cramps and my periods are much heavier. I honestly feel like I'm 13 years old and having to re-learn about my body.
TwoXChromosome X ? If I were in your situation, I'd ask my doctor about progestin-only birth control to see if it was safe to help. It doesn't affect blood pressure.
TwoXChromosomes X Those statistics reflect population percentages not individual chance. It doesn't mean that each woman has a 1% chance of getting pregnant but rather that about 1% of the population on birth control pills will experience a pregnancy while on them.  No woman will know whether or not she is the type for whom the pill doesn't work which is why these percentages are advertised.    Example: I have a friend that got pregnant with three of her children while on the pill so it is clear that the pill doesn't work at all for her.  I have never gotten pregnant on the pill during the four years I've been on it so I'm likely to be someone for whom the pill is 100% effective.  
TwoXChromosomes X You could be sensitive/allergic to the glycerin or the preservatives.  Most water-based lubes contain glycol (eg polyethylene glycol), parabens and glycerin. I had problems with these cheap lubes, so I use Sliquid Natural/Organic or Yes. Neither of them have the bad ingredients, and they feel great on me. Women with vulvodynia should try these two brands of lube.
TwoXChromosomes X I've always thought adoption could be a great option, but I got pregnant by accident not long before I "ideally" wanted to have kids, so I just went with it.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm fine with the period itself, but the migraines I've started getting on the last day or the day after my period, and now on the day I ovulate can fuck right off.
TwoXChromosomes X When I took Loestrin 24 my doctor OK'd me to skip the placebo pills completely and just start the new pill pack to avoid a period. The trouble was, my period came anyway, even though I went straight to the new pack of active pills :(
TwoXChromosomes X Just a warning about Loestrin 24fe... that's the birth control that my doctor started me.  I stuck with it for about 5 months.  After month 2, I began having two periods a month.  Not spotting or light leakage, a full on period twice a month.  I switched asap.
TwoXChromosomes X Not gonna lie, I've switched my panty liners to Kotex because the packaging is colourful and makes the fact that I'm bleeding out of one my favourite holes a little better. 
TwoXChromosomes X That sounds about right!  Can he do it with his hands so you can feel it better?  For me it kinda feels like pressure and then a gushing feeling.   Enjoy!  And throw some towels down :)
TwoXChromosomes X Those are two very different situations. I'm talking about a fetus who is either incredibly premature (to the point of non-viability) or one with a medical condition that is not compatible with life (born without lungs, heart, brain). 
BabyBumps X Right.  What she did is reach her fingers in and swiped them between the membranes and the cervix.  She did it three times.  Apparently, when you separate the membranes from the cervix, it releases hormones that increase the likelihood you'll go into labor.  She told me I'd have a 50/50 chance of going into labor within 48 hours.    However, once she did it, she looked a little bit skeptical.  She told me she had a hard time reaching (I'm not sure what that means.  Do I have a long vagina?  A long cervix?  I don't know.).  She also said there was no blood present.  I asked her if that was a good thing.  She said, "Well, when there's blood, it usually has a better chance."  It did not work for me.  That was Wednesday, and now it's Sunday (still no baby).  I'm sure she'll repeat the procedure this week again, too.
TwoXChromosomes X Stacking is skipping the placebos and taking the active pills continuously. Some lend themselves well to this (like Yaz or Seasonique), but some don't and then you risk breakthrough bleeding or other unpleasant side effects. Better to ask the pharmacist.
Parenting X This will sound so weird- but crushed garlic, on a swab, and into that ear, its an antibiotic and it should start the clear up, you may need to wash it out with some water or swab it out later, but I have heard of many mothers doing it and the infection cleared up in about 12 hours 
TwoXChromosomes X Use smaller tampons with an applicator. Tampax pearl lights might be best.  If it hurts coming out, perhaps it's too dry. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was a size 4 once, and I was healthy...then I gained 80lbs and I wasn`t healthy.  So I changed what I ate and started to exercise, I gained another 20lbs, but I was healthy.  I started doing drugs and drinking a lot...Lost 30lbs but unhealthy.  Stopped doing drugs lost 20 more still unhealthy.  Gained every pound back plus a few more and I have never been healthier 
BabyBumps X All descent advice until you hav been in labor for 10 hours and the doc decides since you have no progressed far enough they are going to do a c-section. Just saying.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think that dudes really get the level of paranoia that some of us ladies deal with on a monthly basis.  I mean, I've always used reliable protection with my man, but I almost ALWAYS have a minor freak out every month.  Part of the reason may be that I've never been quite as regular as some women - there's usually a two week margin of error (just enough time for me to freak the fuck out).  However, now that I'm on hormonal BC, I'm much more regular and therefore haven't freaked out in a while.
TwoXChromosomes X Are you 100% sure you're allergic?  I would get the same burning feeling, and not want to have sex for a few hours/days because it just hurt so bad, but I looked it up and talked to my mom (we're really open about sex) and she said it might be because I'm not wet enough/not enough lube. Especially if he's wider (my boyfriend is really wide), then he can tear/stretch some skin while going in, and when he comes it burns that.   So we tried lubing up, and things have been great. Just an idea! If you're sure it is a semen allergy than disregard this! 
TwoXChromosomes X Ahh, okay. So you're about to start another pack then? It's normal to have your hormones not know which way is up during the first few months, up to 3-6 for most women who experience changes I've always been told by them doctors.
TwoXChromosomes X I'll give you the opposite story: I have had so many scares about implantation bleeding! It was always a scare because it didn't happen at the time my period was due, but a week or two earlier (so when I was most fertile) and so after a few times I got to researching. Apparently a low progesterone level can cause very little pink/brown bleeding that happens at that time, that's what was happening.   But when you mention fake period: it couldn't have been a full-on, heavy-bleeding period?
TwoXChromosomes X [Here is a full thread]( _now_2xc_here_is_a_list_its_up_to_you_to_make/) of BC that may be helpful for you :) I personally had the Mirena IUD and really recommend that. 
Parenting X Good times ahead. You will do everything while your SO recovers and beyond. Don't expect any credit or enquiries into how you are doing. You won't sleep for a long time and well wishers will patronize you by saying that you should give your SO a rest. Totally the best experience in life, wouldn't change it for anything or anyone. Congratulations!
BabyBumps X I think that you should wait until you are sure that the person you'd be having a baby with would be a worthwhile father. it seems to me you aren't even sure of your SO and once you have a child with a person, that person is a part of you and your child's life for as long as they live--even when they aren't around, their genes are a part of your child, and your son or daughter will always want to know about Dad. You don't sound sure. 
BabyBumps X Wife (27 wks) and I just finished birthing classes this weekend. We decided to go for the two day 'quick study' that our hospital offered. It was a great idea. Since this is a first for us, and will be my first actual experience with a baby at all, I really needed the newborn/infant care information, but the relaxation methods and description of the hospital's methods ended up being incredibly vital.  This could be somewhat irrelevant given that your classes wouldn't be at your hospital, though.
BabyBumps X NTNTC #4 perhaps?  (not trying not to conceive)  We aren't trying, but we're not actively trying not to either. That's how #3 came about after 2 years of TTC, finally decided it was bad timing (I know that's not WHY I got pregnant, but I know that's why I got pregnant... you know?)
BabyBumps X Mine showed up the DAY I turned 6 weeks. It finally went away around 15 weeks. Let's hope yours just never comes! I was painfully nauseous all day long, but was never really able to throw up. It was terrible.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you tried a menstrual cup, like Lunette? I used to do the tampon/pad doubling up thing, too. It sucks. These days I use menstrual cup + cloth pantyliner. Saves a lot of money on pads/tampons and don't have to change it as much (every 8-12 hours.) Usually nothing even gets on the pantyliner, but I like it just in case.
TwoXChromosomes X I was thinking about it, but so paranoid about it spilling or not putting it in right. Has it ever done that for you or do you prefer the cup to pads/tampons?
BabyBumps X I didn't get morning sickness at all, just faint nausea most of the time. You might be lucky!
TwoXChromosomes X Well it takes everybody a bit to figure out how to put it in right. I take it out when I'm over the toilet, so that it will spill into the toilet. Then I wipe out what's left with toilet paper. If I'm at home, I will also wash it out at the sink before putting it back in. Until your confident it's in right, it's a good idea to wear a pad or pantyliner. Also, there are several different kinds of menstrual cups. Some are softer/firmer, different rims, capacity, etc. With how heavy your flow sounds, I'd personally recommend trying Lunette or something with similar capacity. When I had a Diva Cup, I had to empty it way too often (Lunette size 2 holds twice as much.) I stopped having problems with leakage during the day after I switched.  Edit: Link for cup comparison 
TwoXChromosomes X It's been proven that there is no difference between hygiene in a circumcised and uncircumcised penis. Actually, if your child is circumcised there are links to it causing more UTIs than that of an uncircumcised penis, so the hygiene argument is in fact thrown out :) 
BabyBumps X I do support for NFLX, and was planning on working till two weeks before my due date just to get more money, but SPD got me on early (unpaid) leave at 35 weeks. Before that, I was mostly fine at work; I switched to a sit/stand desk during the second tri so I could move around a bit more because sitting all day was killing my back and uterus. And I spent a LOT more time going to the bathroom, but no one cared.   I'm taking my full paid STD leave (6-8 weeks) and FMLA benefits leave (12 weeks, overlapping), and then I get an additional 12 weeks unpaid, no benefits "bonding time" leave with my job guaranteed. My husband just got a new job, and his bennies should kick in right when mine end, so I may just go on his bennies and return to work p/t. Honestly, I'm not sure I want to go back, though.
TwoXChromosomes X Same here as well. Before Loestrin, my period was always light-- 3-4 days, max. Even on other BC pills I still menstruated. First month on Loestrin, BAM, no period (that REALLY freaked me out, for the first few months!) When I've brought it up to my OBGYN, she didn't seem to think it was a big deal. Yay no periods!
BabyBumps X Congratulations!! That's great news!  Personally we waited with our first pregnancy to tell people, including family but then when we miscarried at 7w3d we ended up telling all those people we would have told early on, immediate family not FB or extended family, anyway... and it was really awkward and DH's mom seemed really upset that she had to find out we were pregnant and lost the baby all at the same time.  Fast forward 7 months and we just found out we're expecting again.  We told our immediate families right away this time because we know we'll need their support if we miscarry again.
TwoXChromosomes X Wow, I'm terribly jealous of most of you ladies. My period is eight to ten days long, I go through a super plus tampon every hour for the first three days, and the cramps are so bad (I am talking fucking *primal* levels of pain, me moaning in the fetal position while compulsively massaging my own arms) that my ob-gyn finally gave me Vicodin for them.  On the bright side, I'm having surgery soon to get rid of the damned fibroids that cause all this. Maybe then I'll be able to be a normal 34 year old!
TwoXChromosomes X It was probably an infection of some sort. Bacterial Vaginosis does have a particular smell to it, but there are other types of bacteria that can cause infections, and these do smell different.  Not just bacteria can cause infections, there can be fungal infections too.  I think I had a fungal infection once, and it smelled like something was rotting inside my body. It was fucking WEIRD.  If it smells like an infection, she probably has one - I would trust yourself to have a good nose for it, it sounds like you're experienced enough to tell the difference between normal and out of whack. (And downvoters, there IS a difference!!) 
TwoXChromosomes X Either strain can be either place (or rather, several places).    Meaning, HSV2 can be passed genital to oral.  It's not limited to genital, just like HSV1 isn't limited to oral.  
BabyBumps X I'm so jealous of you Canadians. My husband is actually Canadian and had told me about what mothers get for maternity leave, plus fathers get a paternity leave! Must be nice! :)
TwoXChromosomes X So, the rule (for most combined birth control, with natazia/qlara being the exception) is that if you take at least 21 days of active pills in a row, and no more than 7 placebo pills after that, you'll be protected.  All of the active (blue) pills in a pack of OTC lo are enough to keep you from getting pregnant, so next time you take the wrong pill you can just take the next pill at the right time and not worry about it. You might get some spotting because the sudden shift in hormone levels can confuse your uterus, but you should still be protected from pregnancy.  For this month, you've basically taken two pills in a day, which means that when you get to the end of the pack you'll have taken 21 active pills, but only over 20 days.  This might mean that your ovaries wake up while you're in the placebo week, since you don't have the full 21 days of keeping them dormant.  If I were in your place, I would either take an extra pill from another pack at the end of this current one, giving you 22 active pills over 21 days, (and then set aside the pack you took the extra out of to use if you want to take more than 21 days of pills to shift your period, or to have as backups in case you drop a pill, or throw up right after taking one, etc), skip the placebos from this pack and go straight into the next one (which might cause spotting) or I would use condoms starting in the last week of the active pills through when I had taken 7 active pills in a row from the next pack.    That said, I'm not a doctor or a pharmacist, so the best thing to do is to call one of them and ask what you should do.  I wouldn't panic though, you haven't compromised your protection right now.  
TwoXChromosomes X IUD   Worst part: Heavy periods (mines starting to slow down now, though). Also, killer cramps. Insertion wasn't fun, but it's over with quickly.  Best part: No other side effects. And especially no babies. I don't have to think about birth control again for 10 years. It's awesome.
BabyBumps X I didn't have classes in my area but I read the book a couple of times and practiced with the CD. It really helped with the birth of babies nr. 2 and 3, wish I'd read it before my first birth :) I recommend hypnobirthing to every pregnant woman I meet ;)
Parenting X Somewhat relevant user name lol... that's funny, with my last, I was induced 3 weeks early due to toxemia. As soon as we got to the hospital, I saw my cousin who was also pregnant, and she was being induced as well for the same thing. A few hours into labor, one of my co-workers was wheeled by the doorway of my room, also in labor. So my daughter was born at 2:59 am, my cousin's son was born at 4:15, and my co-worker's at 5:03 all in the same hospital on the same day.
TwoXChromosomes X I know, right? It's open-ended. It boils down to the deeper philosophical debate that asks the question: "At what point do human cells and tissue take on a life, and mind, of their own?"  At what point would you stop seeing 'it' as a fetus and start seeing 'it' as a baby temporarily living inside its mother?  EDIT: See mr_bag's post.
TwoXChromosomes X There are over-the-counter medicines like AZO and Uristat, but that costs money, too. I suggest seeking help on your campus as well because it will be either free or cheap. You really need antibiotics to make the infection go away, because those medicines just take the pain away. In the meantime, drink cranberry juice stat!
TwoXChromosomes X I used [the Keeper]( ) for over a year (I'm quite pregnant now, so no need for it currently).  It took some getting used to for me, as far as how to correctly position it, but after a month or two I had the hang of it, and it works like a charm!  I highly recommend it!  I also used [lunapanties]( ) at night/ on super flow days, and had some reusable pantyliners for other days (for my super heavy flow).  I also commuted by bike while using these products!
BabyBumps X I took First Response before my missed period and didn't get a positive until like 2 days after missed period so not always able to detect early.
BabyBumps X Those internet strips are way more sensitive-- I got my BFP when I was 12 DPO or 3 weeks, 5 days pregnant. 
TwoXChromosomes X The Diva Cup and most other menstrual cups are made with medical-grade silicone.
BabyBumps X I lost mine at 27 weeks with blood (ended up going on bedrest until an ultrasound showed no reason for worry) then lost it for REAL at 41w6d  and that time she was born 4 hours later.  edit: going through my timeline I kept with her, I also lost it at 36 weeks without blood and 38 weeks blood tinged... but wasn't until 41w6d that it meant labor. Really got frustrating.
TwoXChromosomes X That is so strange to me. It took me a few tries to get the hang of using the cup too, but it was more a positioning issue. I've never heard of anyone getting dried out from it before... Quite the opposite, I find it leaves everything happily moist, unlike tampons. :\ Sorry, ma'am.
BabyBump X -to-induce-labor.html  Why are you being induced? Also, what is your Bishop's score? Your chance of a successful induction is much better if you have a good Bishop's score. -time mom with a low Bishop's score... 45% odds of c-section.   If you're being considered "overdue" and are not yet 42 weeks, or have been told your baby is big, or are just being sick of pregnancy... none of those are indications for an induction according to the ACOG.  As the patient, it's your call. If you're feeling pushed into this, know that it's still you choice.  If you really feel it is best, let go of your fear and know that you're making the best decision you know and that's all any of us can do.  Fear won't do any good for your labor.  ;)
TwoXChromosomes X Are you sure it is a yeast infection and not a bacterial infection? Bacterial infections can itch too, and need antibiotics to be cleared up.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm sorry your ability to read and comprehend this simple concept is clouding your understanding. Please do a little more than a google search and hopefully you'll get the point. But here's one last shot to summarize:  If the entire reason a person claims that abortions are wrong is due to the concept that abortions kill a life and killing is wrong (which is usually backed by a religious undertone), then yes, unfortunately for the conservatives, people who do things they don't like are also considered 'lives' that should also not be taken.    Or more simply  Killing is wrong, Abortion is killing, Therefore abortion is wrong. The death penalty is killing, The death penalty is also wrong.   It all goes back to the REASON people ultimately believe in something. And wiki's history clearly states that the concept of pro-life was coined as such to include all human life. If you doubt this, go as a self identified pro-lifer WHY abortion is wrong and then apply that argument to capital punishment or other similar issues.
TwoXChromosomes X I used to get a lot of yeast infections.  If it is a yeast infection, not bacterial, as others have mentioned, all of the treatments should theoretically work. BUT: for me, the one day treatment was always less effective and very irritating, as was any product made by Monistat.  All of them irritated my bits so much that the infection ended up cycling back.  Clortimazole was the only medicine that worked for me.  The others also made it burn when I peed.   Once you get it under control, eat yogurt a/o acidophilus.  Best of luck.
TwoXChromosomes X I was you at 21, for sure. Never had a yeast infection, BV, or even a UTI. I'm 27 now and I've had four UTIs over the last two years. As a super-fun bonus, the last major UTI I had (the one where I was peeing blood) was treated by antibiotics that *instantly* gave me a yeast infection. I've had no problems since then, but jeez. Awfulness.  These problems can be caused by a million different things. My doctor seemed to think that my recurrent UTIs were a result of being mildly dehydrated most of the time, and since I've been more conscious about drinking enough water, they seem to have cleared up. My one yeast infection was because of antibiotics. I'm not doing anything different hygiene-wise or behavior-wise than I was ten years ago, but bodies change as you age.   Just consider yourself lucky that you don't have these problems, and remember that you might have 'em tomorrow. Lady-parts health is just like every other type of health: take care of yourself as well as you're able to and hope for the best. 
TwoXChromosomes X  While I and others are pro-choice, many people believe that abortions should not be used as birth control.  This is why a woman having 6-7 abortion upsets more than a woman only having 1. If you don't want to have a child, then there are other safer ways (i.e. the pill and the day after pill) to prevent it.  If your pregnancy is life threatening or resulted from rape, then I support abortion because I believe a current life is more important than a potential life.
TwoXChromosomes X I think that in many cases, they cause a lot of unhappiness - unexpected and unanticipated unhappiness.  If the pregnancy was unwanted, it would have been better if it had never happened, i.e. through the use of birth control, lack of a crime, or whatever happened that caused the pregnancy.  Of course, that's in a perfect world - so again, I support abortion.  Why would anyone celebration the termination of human life? Better to prevent it or allow it to happen.  Why do you love abortion? Do you disagree that it would be better to prevent unwanted pregnancy? If so, why?
TwoXChromosomes X ABORTION IS BIRTH CONTROL. It is by its VERY DEFINITION controlling birth. Neither the pill nor the emergency contraceptive are guaranteed to work and shit happens.
TwoXChromosomes X Abortion should be a legal procedure because it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. I have not had one, but the option was a real consideration when I was pregnant. I think that if abortion was illegal, women would still find ways to abort, and/or the number of abandoned babies will jump enormously.
TwoXChromosomes X I've never been able to rotate mine, but I'm sure as heck getting a seal.  I've started doing a finger swirl just to make sure it isn't folded over; insert the cup, do the soldier march thing (standing in place, lift one knee up to your chest and then down, then lift the other knee up and then down), and then insert a finger and swirl it around the outside of the cup.  If the cup is dented in, I can generally do a couple of kegels and leg lifts to adjust it.
BabyBumps X She had pre eclampsia with her second pregnancy when she was in her 20's. She went on to have a bajillion healthy kids before getting it again with Josie. Josie was the only one of her children to suffer from any health problems. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think it is very easy for someone to be pro-choice and also be against partial birth abortions for healthy fetuses.  Although fetal viability will change, there is absolutely going to be a line for "unviable."  Really 20ish weeks is that point, before 20 weeks organs won't be developed AT ALL.  The baby WILL NOT LIVE without its necessary organs.  
BabyBumps X At first I was convinced it was a boy. But about 2 nights before my anatomy ultrasound, I changed my mind for some reason. Suddenly I was convinced it was a girl. I laughed when the ultrasound tech said it was a girl. 
TwoXChromosomes X Personhood is a void concept used to exclude human beings so they can be murdered or slaved.  I agree that fetus being "alive" or not is completely different than the mother being responsible for him or not. Most "pro-choicers" can't see the this.  But once people realize that the fetus is a human being and is the child of the mother/"host", very few will support abortion (unless the usual exceptions). That's why the dehumanization of the fetus is made. Because based on the "right to body" alone, the support for abortion would be minimum.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm saying that personhood is not relevant to the question of abortion. It's a human being that's growing and achieving milestones each day and if it hasn't yet achieved some milestone that some philosopher likes is irrelevant.  &gt; I'm not saying that we should go around terminating pregnancies willy nilly  That's exactly what happens today.   &gt; but saying that a fetus has the same rights as a fully grown person is ludicrous.  The only right he needs is the right to life and a place in the womb of his mother. Do you think that being in the uterus of the mother is such a horrible crime to be dealt with death penalty?  &gt; but I still think that it's ridiculous to say that it's already a child.  It's a human being at the fetus stage of development.  Embryo -&gt; Fetus -&gt; Child -&gt; Adolescent -&gt; Adult -&gt; Old -&gt; Death.
BabyBumps X I was completely wrong. Thought boy. Thought boy so much that I thought the u/s tech was joking when he put on the screen 'it's a girl!'   I was in shock for a few days. It wasn't that I didn't want a daughter it was that it seemed much more overwhelming to me. Now at 39+3 I'm more than ecstatic it's a girl. 
TwoXChromosomes X No.  Only once it is out of my body. Only then it is a separate entity.  Until then, I do not want to be forced to do anything against my will for the sake of the fetus.  If you assign a viable fetus personhood when it is in the woman's body, then you potentially open up the door for forced C-sections, preventing a women from getting cancer treatments, sending a women to jail for vehicular homicide for getting in a car accident and having a miscarriage, the list is endless.  This is especially worrisome to me now that I'm pregnant. The idea that I could be forced into medical treatment that would harm my health for the sake of a fetus, no matter what stage it's in, terrifies me.   So no, making that the legal definition of personhood would not make me happy.
TwoXChromosomes X I would add that the difference is also that it was not the mother's choice whether or not she lost the fetus. That choice was taken away from her by an act of nature or an act of murder. I feel that often times in debating whether or not a fetus is a person we drop the idea of privacy of the mother to make decisions about her body, her health, and her quality of life. 
TwoXChromosomes X The doctor said that your uterus is extra soft after delivery and the longer you wait the tougher it gets.  They think that my uterus just wasn't going to toughen up enough since it had been a few months.  I have heard that bleeding is heavier on the Paraguard, but the ladies that I've known to have it the thought it was great.
TwoXChromosomes X No, I'm pro-choice. Being pro-life would only mean we would lose more lives when women chose unsafe abortions. I'm a Quaker; all human lives are sacred to me. 
TwoXChromosomes X So just like 2 hours ago I talked to my big sister, she has a Mirena IUD and is changing it out for a Paraguard on friday. I've been on the pill since I was 16, and everything was fine until a few months ago. My sex drive is GONE. Like, haven't fucked my boyfriend in 2 months (And I feel so shitty about it, but when we try I can't get wet and it ends up hurting too much), and the sex has been off and on for a few months before that. I also started getting a SUPER short fuse, like freaking the fuck out about him being 5 minutes late to pick me up from work, or him going out with his friends instead of hanging out with me (Which I used to be okay with).  I am Facebook friends with my doctor and messaged her asking if I could come in and talk about paraguard as an option. My only concern is that I got on BC because I had heavy, painful periods that resulted in me vomiting, writhing on my bathroom floor and fainting. I would really love to get my sex drive back, and I hate myself for the bitch I've become on hormonal BC, but I'm worried about my awful periods. Is it true that Paraguard makes periods worse? I don't know how I could handle anything worse than what it used to be.
TwoXChromosomes X Are there any methods that prevent ovulation without also having the potential to cause a fertilized egg to not implant? Plan B is just a stronger dose of hormonal birth control. The issue with condoms is that some people are allergic to latex (and other condoms are less effective). Some people also prefer to use two methods of birth control (in case condoms break, for example). Taking Plan B is not an option for me, so I have been on birth control for years, even though I plan on using condoms if I become sexually active again.
TwoXChromosomes X i don't think it's so much that she thinks she *can't* raise a child without a father, but that she feels any child she has *deserves* a father. it also seems that, based on her school situation, she really doesn't have time for a pregnancy anyway - she'd have to choose between prenatal care, labor and delivery (to say nothing of raising the child alone) and her education.
TwoXChromosomes X Early pregnancy (first trimester) generally presents the highest risk of the most severe birth defects from alcohol. FAS and conditions like it can very much be caused by women drinking or taking drugs incompatible with pregnancy because they didn't realize they were pregnant, and they are often more severe than they otherwise would be especially because the embryo and early fetus is particularly vulnerable to damage by exposure.   While the OP still likely has a good chance of having a perfectly healthy baby if they were to choose parenting or adoption, dismissing her concerns altogether because she only drank during early pregnancy is ridiculous- because that's incidentally when you're at the highest risk. This is something she needs to weigh with a doctor, not be told that it isn't a concern when it is. 
BabyBumps X Nope, FMLA is unpaid.  It only exists to ensure you can get your job back after taking unpaid time off.  The business can still give it to him under company policy, but they are under no obligation and he has no protection.  Sigh.... healthcare.... what a novel concept...
BabyBumps X Have you tried a different brand of test?  With my daughter I went into the doctor, having got a faint positive, and her test came back negative.
TwoXChromosomes X I must have a really well regulated vagina because I've taken antibiotics MANY times and never had a yeast infection. 
TwoXChromosomes X the antibiotics only target bacteria. There is always a balance of bacteria and fungus in your vagina, with the bacteria keeping the fungus in check, basically. So you take antibiotics, and it takes care of that nasty cold, but it also takes care of that bacteria in your lady bits, and the fungus takes over...
TwoXChromosomes X Well...yeah. If a man and I want to have sex, and I won't have sex with him unless he's wearing a condom, and he won't have sex with me unless he's NOT wearing a condom, then we're not having sex. Men can refuse to wear condoms; women can refuse to have sex with them. 
BabyBumps X Just to share my own experience.. this happened to me. I was actually 10 days late and no tests showed a positive. I eventually got my period and my feeling is that I may have had a really early miscarriage or something of the like since my periods are usually on time. We kept trying and a few months later I was pregnant for real! Hopefully if this doesn't turn out to be a pregnancy for you, it may serve as a sign that things are working! Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I had a tubal three years ago. No issues. Every month I get some mild cramping related to ovulation, but other than that, it's been fine. It's also been great to be pretty sure that there won't be any surprises on the way. :-)  Oh, but if you're on the pill now, you probably will notice that your cycle is more intense. Not awful, but noticeable.
TwoXChromosomes X I really have to think things through all the way...so I'm most likely not pregnant because I've been having regular periods for so long thanks to birth control and had sex the day after my period stopped? That's what I've been telling myself...
BabyBumps X Your cycle is probably going back to its "norm."  Everyone is extremely regular on the pill since it basically tells your body when to have your period.  Now that you're off, you're not having that hormonal influence.  I'm betting your regular cycle might be a little longer than the normal 28 day one.  
BabyBumps X Congratulations! How far apart are your two kids?  "I'd been at increased risk of high blood pressure during delivery because of my increased HCG levels early in the pregnancy." - I hadn't heard this before, just wondering about it since my hcg levels were 5.5 mom (5.5 times the average) at my 12 week appointment.
TwoXChromosomes X Be careful with the wipes if you're UTI or yeast infection-prone.  Those are designed to kill all bacteria, not just the bad.  Vaginas need a special PH and those wipes, as well as douches, tend to throw things off-kilter and upset our happy little environments.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't actually mess with wipes unless I have a yeast infection then I use that little lady wipette that they stick in the package that makes the itching stop.  I've only have 2 yeast infections so... that's good.
BabyBumps X Had it been a long time since you last peed? If you have a full bladder that has not been emptied in awhile your urine becomes concentrated and darker.   I drink a ton of water too, but my first pee of the day and in the middle of the night is always darker because I've been holding it awhile.  *Edit: Please though, consult your doctor if you feel you may have a UTI or bladder infection as this can lead to preterm labor. 
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks. I really just don't fucking understand how selfish TwoXers have seemed lately. You have sex, you might get pregnant. It's your choice whether or not to keep the baby. But, as hard as I know it is, your choice should be based on reason. Would this put a strain on the people you love financially or emotionally? Would this put a strain on you financially or emotionally? Is that strain so much that you could be bringing this child into a bad situation? Every child deserves to be cared for and loved. If one or both parents don't want it then that should factor into the decision because it's fucking difficult to go through life with a single parent knowing that the other one never wants to see you.   It's your body and your choice. *But you're not the only one affected by it and you're selfish if you're not factoring in everyone to your decision.* Having the choice doesn't give you a pass to do something stupid. 
BabyBumps X I'm going through the exact same thing right now, two months, no period, negative tests, constant worrying. I've talked to quite a few folks who all are assuring me it is just a fluke from coming off of birth control. I've read it can take up to 6 month to a year to get your cycle back in normal shape. I wish I had known more about that before I ever went on the pill. :/
TwoXChromosomes X I'm telling her to do what's right for her. Yes. But no I'm not telling her to keep the baby and struggle through life. She could carry the child to full term and then give it up for adoption. She needs to make a decision for herself because she is going to have to live with that decision for the rest of her life. I'm sorry if I irked you. I should have worded my advice to her better.  
BabyBumps X Start having sex 4 days before ovulation, each day.  Normally the sperm live for a few days and you have a 12-20 hour window for your egg.  2 and 3 days before ovulation is ideal, not the day before.  
TwoXChromosomes X For most women this eventually settles down. I had a month of spotting at a time when I started on the Depo injection, but nothing now.
BabyBumps X At my last ultrasound the technician told me that with today's modern equipment the full bladder isn't all that important. It used to be used because sound waves travel much better through liquid, so they get a better picture if you have a full bladder. Recently, improvements in the equipment have made this less vital, but it depends on how old your clinics equipment is. Many clinics still request a full bladder even when they don't really need it. Also, because the anatomy scan at 20 weeks is so vital, you may want to do it anyway.  My personal experience: with three scans with my first, and four so far with my second, (across three different labs) all but one tech told me I could go to the ladies room and empty my bladder within minutes of starting the scan. It just wasn't that big a deal. The one who didn't was a very old and cruel woman who took an hour to do my scan, pushing my bladderthe whole time, and ignoring my pleas for a washroom.  
BabyBumps X The only ultrasound I had to have a full bladder for was the one at 13 weeks, when they were checking the development of his nuchal tube during my CVS screening. The tech said it made it easier to see and get an accurate measurement that way. I didn't even know in advance that they needed me full...I just mentioned to the tech that I had to go and she told me to hold it. Most painful 20 minutes of my first/second trimester.
BabyBumps X My husband and I enjoyed reading The Caveman's Pregnancy Companion. It was informative and gave lots of good advice for the male on what to do and how to help. I found What to Expect was difficult to read. I found it boring in some places and scary in others.
Parenting X Her limp became obvious when she was around 18 months old, though there were at least a few times before that when I thought I noticed a limp but dismissed it upon closer inspection when she seemed to be walking normally. We saw our GP, who ordered blood tests and an x-ray. They were normal, so he sent us to an orthopedist, who ordered another x-ray. That was also normal, so we were then referred to a pediatric rheumatologist. She ordered more blood tests and a bone scan, and shortly after that we were given the diagnosis. I suspected it all along but, of course, was hoping for something a little less chronic. We were lucky in that it only took a few months to get the diagnosis. She started Naproxen immediately and had a corticosteroid injection a week later. She also had to wear a leg splint for a few months, because by that time she'd developed a substantial contracture. We really like the rheumatology team that's been looking after her. They've been great.  I don't think JRA is hereditary in the sense that it's passed from one generation to another. I think it's that autoimmune conditions are hereditary rather than the specific form. For example, my father and brother both have the autoimmune form of diabetes. My brother also has vitiligo, which is an autoimmune condition of the skin. I have Grave's disease, which is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid. It's this family history that seems to be responsible for my daughter's JRA.
TwoXChromosomes X I have ovarian cysts and the pain is worst right before my period and about 2 weeks after my period. Sometimes I double over in pain and almost become immobilized from the pain. They could be bursting ovarian cysts. 
TwoXChromosomes X As in anti-abortion?  I always think that term is clearer than pro-life, as it implies that pro-choice could also be the opposite, anti-life, which is ridiculous.  I also equate pro-life to people fighting the death penalty, which I find anti-abortionists don't feel as strongly about, as a group.  
BabyBumps X I felt some flutters and bubbles last week (I'm 17 w 1 d). I didn't know what it was at first. I read my pregnancy book and it said bubbles is the baby moving :) Since then I've been on the lookout :)
BabyBumps X Depends on the brand. First response the control line is the second one.  Also, faint means "pregnant but this test stick is picking up a lower amount of hcg, may be you but also may be the stick" (even two sticks from the same batch can work differently.  Any second line at all (provided its the right color, in the right location, and comes up in the test limit (means you are pregnant)  I'm sure you know this now, just putting it here for others who don't.
BabyBumps X Oh lord! I can't imagine. I'd wake up and my husband would have his hand on my belly feeling her morning hiccups. He loved feeling her move from the very beginning. He hasn't felt my belly as much the last month or so but her movement is much less dramatic now too as in 40+1 
TwoXChromosomes X Regarding getting it up there--have you tried different folds? Personally I can only use the "7-fold" if I want it to get up there comfortably. Check out www.menstrualcups.org if you're interested. I find that my Lunette is a lot easier for insertion because it is firmer, so I can just fold it tiny, stick it in there, and not have to worry about fussing with it to get it to pop open. You can also make the cup slightly softer by running it under warm water before insertion. Alternatively, if you have to fuss with it to get it to pop open, you can run it under cold water. As far as public goes--carry a water bottle with you. You can rinse your cup out using that.
BabyBumps X sounds like me, my gynae said I would probably need IVF, so we decided to start trying anyway, thinking we had about a year and then we fall pregnant straight away
TwoXChromosomes X You can actually get the UK Moon Cup on Ebay - that's where I got mine! I read up a lot on them before making the choice on which to buy, and it does seem to generally be considered a bit easier to insert. I hardly ever have issues with mine. It is a bit of a learning curve, but worth it IMO - saves SO MUCH MONEY on tampons, also doesn't leave nasty shit in your vag like tampons. If you can, bring a bottle of water in your purse to the bathroom for rinsing purposes.
BabyBumps X I knew right at 4 weeks, so I could only have been pregnant for about 3 days before i found out. My only early symptoms were "early period" symptoms: sore boobs, fatigue, general crankiness.
TwoXChromosomes X Those plastic wings on pads get really irritating sometimes. Cloth pads will help. If you're not using tampons, you probably won't want to go with the menstrual cup, but I've got to tell you, it turns periods from ordeals into minor inconveniences.
BabyBumps X This. And Ina May's Guide to Breastfeeding is also wonderful.
TwoXChromosomes X Its funny that most gynecologists steer American women away from the IUD when in fact it's very popular in Europe. I swear the health industry wants to do away with any method that they cannot create and monopolize on.   The IUD has very few, if any depending on the girl, side effects when compared to hormonal birthcontrol. My IUD only reminds me it's there once a month in first two days of my period and I've had it for nearly 6mos. I did my own independent research then went to Planned Parenthood who installed it in me for free (yay!). I have never had a child and PPH did not give me the run around when I asked for an IUD unlike **three** different gynecologists gave me. They all prefer to throw chemicals at you. Screw that and the impact it will have on my body.   The chances of gettin preggers while on the pill are the same as the IUD. Also, for the best chances of not getting preggers while on the pill is to take it at the same time. Every. Day.
TwoXChromosomes X Your gyno may have cut them too short.   Mine are too short to be curled, I told le bf to suck it up and not to aim for my cervix. I'd have to have it replaced if I want longer strings.   I was down for a week when I first had it placed. It's staying in for the full effective time.  It may be the positions you're using. Unfortunatly you cannot use a diaphram or cervical cap with an iud. Too much of a risk for it to get sucked out.    Good luck
TwoXChromosomes X Er...  &gt;While the vagina can expand, it's not an open conduit to the abdominal cavity.  Technically, it *is* an open conduit, through the cervix, through the uterus, and out through the fallopian tubes. Which is how endometrial tissue gets out into the abdominal cavity. And those wild stories of a fetus being attached to the aorta. *shudders*
TwoXChromosomes X I am on alesse. It's supposed to be a super low dosage type, with very minimal side effects. Plus you can get a 21 day pack, that doesn't have the sugar pills, which are what i believe causes the weight gain. I haven't had any side effects, but I have only been on it for a month.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on a generic of alesse and have been for three years. I usually don't take the placebo pills, I just don't take the pill during the placebo week (which I've been told by a nurse is fine). I've had pretty good experiences once I got through the adjustment period.
BabyBumps X The first time I was pregnant I just looked really fat. Pretty sure it's gonna be like that this round too :|
TwoXChromosomes X So is it the lower hormone doses that make it safe for you?  I think it's usually seen an alternative because there's no generic and some insurances make it a lot more expensive that pills. Like I said, I was the best hormonal BC I ever used. 
Parenting X Dude I don't no about that advice on the breast pump. :/ All the women in my family needed them from jump, to keep from getting mastitis. My milk came in like crazy. I understand most women don't produce like a jersey. But for those of us who do its a must. I had to pump in addition to nursing my daughter for the first 3 months. I froze the milk for later use and even donated some. 
TwoXChromosomes X There's a [recent post]( _again_the_practice_of_foreskin_restoration/) in OneY about foreskin restoration too.  I admire guys who go through the effort of restoring their foreskin. It's a long road, but you can regain some sensitivity and protection for your penis.
TwoXChromosomes X When I was about 16 or 17, I remember going 9 months without a period. Before then, they were predictable to the day, and then suddenly, just stopped for those months. Then it came back like normal.  This can be due to diet, stress, hormones, weight gain/loss, etc. If you don't think anything different is going on in your life then...well your uterus is just trolling. Happens to almost everyone, if you're not pregnant then nothing to be concerned about :)
TwoXChromosomes X Most combo pills recommend taking the missed pill as soon as you remember, and then taking the next one at your regularly scheduled time. Check your product info leaflet to make sure, though.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're freaking out that much, ask her to take a pregnancy test. Trust me, it alleviates worry really well, AND she's that much more likely to get her period after taking one, just 'cause, y'know, that's how periods work and like to fuck with us. e.e;
TwoXChromosomes X Yep, but I've decided to have at least 1 and adopt another 3. I figured then ill get to experience pregnancy and get to have a big family without going through more pregnancy's :) But who knows what ill be thinking in 5 years...
TwoXChromosomes X A 2-second Google search with "why take a pregnancy test in the morning" as the parameters provides the answer. Here's a quote [from one of the very first links]( -calculator.com/pregnancy-tests/hpt-faq.htm):  &gt;Because home pregnancy tests detect hCG, it is best to collect urine samples containing the highest presence of the hCG hormone. Diluted samples (from drinking high volumes of water / frequent urination) are not recommended and can diminish test accuracy. Instead, first morning urine is considered the ideal sample as it contains the most concentrated presence of hCG. Otherwise, waiting several hours after last urinating to take a test.
BabyBumps X Actually, most FGM consists only of the removal of the clitoral hood; or even 'nicking' the clitoral hood - which is the biological equivalent of male circumcision.  Only in a very small minority of cases are the barbaric practices we think of when we hear 'FGM' actually carried out - but you don't hear anyone distinguishing between FGM and female circumcision; because most people believe any kind of cutting of a young girl's genitals is wrong.  There's nothing wrong with having a sexual preference, as long as you also aren't offended if a man suggests that he prefers a removed clitoral hood or breast implants.  If you're doing such to your baby girl to make her more aesthetically pleasing, however, I see a problem.
BabyBumps X I think my SO started feeling the kicks &amp; wiggles about 2 weeks after I did.  I had to put his hand in the right spot and be very still, and it was only barely that he could feel anything. After that it was a pretty quick change, maybe 1-2 weeks till others could feel the baby, and then another week or two we could all see the baby move. Pretty amazing. Congrats!
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, you were right to take the test yesterday. If you have a (regular) 28 day schedule, you're now about 8 days late. However, stress CAN cause a missed period/late period, so try to relax until it's time to take another test. Good luck!
BabyBumps X Almost had this issue as well.  Luckily, they couldn't get a spinal measurement, so they let my appointment go longer and made me walk around and eat/drink/roll over to get her to move.  We got her to move enough to get the sex reveal, but they still couldn't get the spine so they brought me back in a week later.  Different tech, cooperative baby, and a second confirmation that we have a girl.  If they were both wrong, I'm gonna laugh so hard.
TwoXChromosomes X I had the Shot for 7-8 years and never had any side effects. You can always try it and see how you like it. IF the side effects bother you, you can just not get the next shot and switch to something else then.   I'm switching to the inplanon in December because it has a lower dose of progesterone and I want to try it.   If it sucks I'll get it taken out and start the shot again. 
TwoXChromosomes X Get that shit taken out and then explore your options. A non-hormonal option (like the paraguard IUD) sounds like what you need, not the massively higher dose of hormones you'll get from BCP.   Getting an extra year out of a birth control method that's making you sick and miserable aint worth it. 
BabyBumps X Yes! We are working on our birth plan now, just staying focused on all the positive aspects of pregnancy and birth. We have a Doula and this will be her first birth. She is a close friend and Doula-in-training. Do you have any advice for her? 
TwoXChromosomes X After 3 rounds of antibiotics over the summer I had a super stubborn bakery down there. I'm lucky in that my university has a good women's clinic that I can visit a bunch in order to kick this thing in the butt. As of now I'm pretty sure I'm bakery free! (finally!!!!) but some things to discuss with your doctor based on what I talked about with mine...  -make sure they know what meds you're on or any other conditions you may have..they could affect the pH down there - apparently always pads even though they are unscented have some kind of detergent or what not in them that irritates some people/encourages yeast  I think what finally cured it for me was after a round of terconazole and 300mg of diflucan I just left it alone for awhile. Doc gave me a steroid cream for symptoms but I found that that just irritated it.   good luck!! I feel for you!
TwoXChromosomes X one week to drop 5 lbs, one day to gain 5 lbs.
BabyBumps X I was induced at 42 weeks 2 days... I was 4 cm dilated and I was allowed in the bath right away...Don't know if it's because I was so dilated or if you can go right in.
BabyBumps X Before 12 weeks, when your uterus pops above the pubic bone, it's unfortunately all just bloat :).  With my first, I didn't show til I was 6-7 months along; with subsequent pregnancies, huge bloat came before the positive pregnancy test!
BabyBumps X Lucky! I'm 15 weeks and just look fat :-(.  I mean my belly is bulging but it's not as big of a giveaway like you have. 
BabyBumps X Depending on how far along she is, these could be stretching pains.  They're sharp and quite painful.  She'll experience those throughout the pregnancy, unfortunately.  You can Google "round ligament pain" to learn more.
TwoXChromosomes X A penis is way bigger than a finger.  She may have trouble relaxing her vaginal muscles enough for intercourse at the moment. Have you had intercourse before the first incident?  She may be allergic to the condoms or lube you used.  Stop trying to have intercourse until everything is sorted out.  bgugi on /r/sex helped me come up with this handy acronym for the essentials of sex - FRACTAL: Foreplay, Relaxation, Arousal, Comfort, TAlk, Lubrication.  This is a handy article too: _ow_to_wow_demystifying_painful_intercourse  Best of luck, and feel free to ask me anything. I have been through treatment for sexual pain that came from muscle dysfunction.
TwoXChromosomes X I have to say, that while on the depo, yes there was irregular bleeding and weight gain.....some women get radical mood swings and other such things.....the bigger deal here is actually getting off the depo.  I gained a MASSIVE amount of weight (and an increased appetite.) My libido is almost always zero....and may have a higher risk of osteoperosis, diabetes, and PCOS.  Because the women who report these "after effects" are actually off the Depo shot, doctors don't consider them side effects and won't list them.
BabyBumps X During the last month of my pregnancy, I didn't really gain anything.  In total I had gained about 20-25 lbs.  I was about 180ish and ended up just over 200 lbs.  I really didn't want to go much further over 200, lol
TwoXChromosomes X Were you on combination or progestogen-only pills before? They're quite different in terms of what effects they have on you.   The implant works mainly by limiting the amount of lining on your uterus (so you're never super fertile, basically) and by increasing the mucus on your cervix (which more or less makes a barrier for eggs trying to leave and sperm trying to get in.)
Parenting X My daughter also had formula and a paci in the hospital and it didn't cause any problems. What did cause a problem was me being too lazy to get up and grab the binky in the first two months, offering my pinky instead, and then she wouldn't take the damned pacifier until 6 months of age.
Parenting X Research supports this.  This is pretty standard in NICUs now.  We started doing Kangaroo Care with our 29 week preemies the day after they were born.  Edited to add:  However the NICU would not allow our twins to be in the same incubator together.
BabyBumps X To give you an idea, I gained 50lb during my first pregnancy.  I was keeping track, but my midwife was not, because I could stand to gain a bit- I naturally have a low BMI outside of pregnancy.  My midwife stressed that I should eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm not.  Ie: listen to your body, not the numbers.  Just eat healthy foods, and even some moderate junk, and you should be fine.  Seems to me that gaining 16lb is totally fine for 24 weeks. The baby probably weighs a couple pounds, and then you have to account for the extra blood volume, placenta and amniotic fluid.  I bet you anything you've gained at most 5lb of fat.  Take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's pregnancy... not the catwalk.
Parenting X I planned to breastfeed by daughter before she was born.  However, after her birth, she was immediately taken to the NICU.  When I saw her for the first time the next morning, she had a pacifier in.  And, to top it off, the pacifier had been dipped in sugar water to keep her sucking on it.  For the next ten days, she sucked on the pacifier continuously, and drank 75% of her feedings from bottles, nursing occasionally with a nipple shield.  I was convinced that she would never successfully breastfeed.  However, from the day she got out of the NICU, she has been a champion nurser.  She is now 10 weeks old, and thriving and putting on weight.  Those first ten days of bottles and pacifiers didn't interfere with her ability to breastfeed at all.  I totally understand your frustration, but I'm sure your child will go on to happily nurse.  Good luck!
AskWomen X I've had two uncircumcised partners and five circed ones. I saw no particular difference that I related to the presence/absence of foreskin. In fact, when erect, there's almost no visual difference.  These days, in the US, circumcision is falling out of favor, as the procedure has real risks, some detriments, and only very slight health advantages (which don't outweigh the risks or the other disadvantages). Barely half of newborn boys are circumcised now. Our boys are whole, even though their father is cut; I left it my husband's decision (as I don't have a penis), but referred him to a friend who wasn't circed and who I happened to know was rather vocal in his thanks to his parents for that. ;-)
BabyBumps X I second the gummy ones although besides not having iron, they also don't have calcium and seem to have less DHA than other prenatals. So if you go the gummy route, I would think about supplementing with other vitamins.
Parenting X Yeah, I told my husband last night that his job after the baby is born is to stay with him at all times.  We are going to a hospital where the baby only leaves my room for checkups and shots, thank goodness, but even then I'm going to make sure he goes with him.
Parenting X "Cultural reasons" doesn't mean someone needs to agree with body modification without consent.  I think circumcision is barbaric, even if it is an important tradition in Jewish culture, for example.   I mean, I accept that it's and important tenet of their religion and I would never tell someone what [not] to do, but it still appalls me. 
BabyBumps X I had some pretty bad hip/lower back pain up until around 20 weeks and it got much better until the end.  I was still sore but it wasn't nearly as bad.  I hope it gets better!  Try a new OB if you can.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on BC and whilst it's made it lighter, I still fill a heavy tampon in two hours...
TwoXChromosomes X if he's not ready, he's not ready. if it's that important to you that you have a kid NOW, end the relationship and get a sperm donor and prepare yourself for a life of single parenthood. forcing someone into the role of parent before they're ready or have consented isn't the answer.
TwoXChromosomes X Some women (like me, for example) can't tolerate estrogen based birth controls because they elevate blood pressure. My doctor switched me to progestin only pills because of this very reason. I take my pill every freaking day though because I don't want kids right now. I don't understand how anyone could be so selfish that they would deceive their partner by stopping the pill (or whatever birth control method) without discussing it first. It's disgusting behavior. 
TwoXChromosomes X For anyone who is interested, here are some fact sheets about Plan B: -control/ecinfo.htm  It includes how you can replace Plan B when necessary with regular birth control pills, and gives information on dosage of different brands of pills. Also included is side effects and risks of Plan B, where they make sure to explain:  &gt;EC does not prevent future pregnancies and is less effective than other methods of birth control. If you want to prevent future pregnancies, condoms and spermicide are easily available options. You can buy them over-the-counter and you don't have to wait for the start of your next period. 
TwoXChromosomes X You mean Archibald Leach. Arthur Dent is a character in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
TwoXChromosomes X Lots of couples use condoms AND hormonal birth control to have a back up in case one method accidentally fails. It isn't a matter of trust.  I wouldn't stay with someone I couldn't trust.
TwoXChromosomes X My SO and I aren't sure if we want kids, but we agree that we don't want them right now. I can't imagine being on such a totally different page than my partner. And I feel bad for kids who lose out because their parents weren't emotionally and financially ready to take care of them. Hell, we won't even get a cat because it's expensive, I can't imagine suddenly and unexpectedly having to care for a tiny human! 
BabyBumps X Basically what everyone else has said. I wouldn't get a blood test just yet; 4 days isn't SUPER late, really. My period was once a whole month late, before I actually got pregnant that is. Besides, pulling out and condom use is pretty effective in my experience. I'd say wait a week (it'll suck to wait, I know), and if still no period, take another test first thing in the morning and then reassess from there. 
TwoXChromosomes X Do you mean you didn't take any pills for a week? Or did you immediately start taking the next rotation of pills without a break?
TwoXChromosomes X Your pill is just as effective as if you took a break week. There is no medical reason for the break / "period" week. 
TwoXChromosomes X Ladies...Softcups. 't fix the hormone problem, but they're a hell of a lot better than tampons. So...I'm just throwing that up here...  EDIT: You can use the disposable cups...you know, to avoid the whole "waddle," dripping, and washing your bloody cup out in the sink. That way, changing it is just as convenient as changing a tampon. I like not having a string hanging around between my legs, and I also like the fact that I don't have to worry about a tampon acting like a "plug." You know, when you remove the tampon (which doesn't seem saturated), and suddenly, out pour ALL THE CLUMPS that the tampon was simply blocking before. Softcup = problem solved :)
TwoXChromosomes X Pretty much, unless you have any allergies. I would avoid scented or flavored things; just go for the basics. Maybe go with your boyfriend and pick out something together - you can even ask the pharmacist if you're really unsure.  And, pee afterwards to avoid a UTI. For yeast infections - I like to eat yogurt.
BabyBumps X if you think about it, we only think of toddlers breastfeeding as weird because, as a society, we have established weaning at &lt;1yr as the norm. many other cultures continue breastfeeding past the 1-year mark even up to 5 years old or more. keep in mind that, at any age, your breastmilk adapts to the nutritional needs of your child at that time, so while it may not always be their only source of nutrition, it will always be beneficial to them. that said, the APA recommendation is for mothers to breastfeed up to a year, and beyond that for as long as *mutually* desired by mother and baby. if you're not comfortable breastfeeding a toddler, you're not a bad mother for weaning them at 1 year. :)
TwoXChromosomes X It's totally medically fine to do that. Unfortunately every time I've tried to do this "skip" my period, it ends up lasting the entire month instead of the normal 5 days. No menstrual cheat codes for me :(
TwoXChromosomes X They were created to give women the idea that they are "normal" on birth control and bleed every month just like off BC. Make-believe periods, essentially.   The only real currently known benefit to taking break weeks is that you have a lower chance of unscheduled breakthrough bleeding- which normally fades if you wait it out a few months. If this doesn't happen to you, however, enjoy it!  You should check with your prescriber to make sure your "active" pills contain the same dose in each pill. A minority of pills don't, and those cannot be used constantly as they're designed to taper you on and off the artificial period.
Parenting X My husband and i had sex 10 days after our baby was born. For me it was due to the fact that i didn't tear, and the baby wasn't ever fussy. Now it's tapered off a little bit, to once a week usually. Not anywhere near what we used to be at. Just be patient, making her feel guilty about it before she's ready isn't going to help anything. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have four periods a year using the Nuva ring. I asked my doctor and he said it's safe to do. I have no breakthrough bleeding but my periods I have are a tad heavier than normal.   I haven't had any problems and I've been doing it for three years. I love it. 
Parenting X The Birth Partner - Penny Simkin. This is a good read.  I liked it as much as my hubby.  It's a good non-biased book that covers a lot of different choices....it also isn't the BE AFRAID style of the What to Expect series of books.  I also really like "Let's Panic About Babies" if you're in need of a really good laugh.
TwoXChromosomes X It probably wouldn't hurt to mention it to a doctor, might be a hormonal imbalance, which a simple blood test could rule out. Best of luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Why do you do that?  I use the Nuva Ring too... but I still let myself have my period every month, unless I'm going on vacation or something, then I'll make myself skip my period.
TwoXChromosomes X I find my period is best now that I use re-usable products instead of horrible disposable ones. Oh yeah and I stopped buying into the idea that it's gross or shameful.
BabyBumps X Same here!  Around 23 weeks I started feeling him move everywhere and around 26-27 weeks I could see him moving around through my belly - I'm still loving it (no pain yet!) and find myself staring at my stomach for hours :)  I just love watching and feeling him move (for now). I've also noticed that if I've been on my feet for a while, then sit on the couch and lean back, he'll reposition himself, so there is a lot of movement.  It's my favorite part of the day!  Haha.
TwoXChromosomes X My doctor switched my BC due to extreme cramps, migraines, and heavy bleeding.  She told me that I can skip every other period if I wanted to, and she said for the first 2 months I should skip, so my body has enough time to adjust before I allow a period (due to the reasons above).
BabyBumps X I always felt them around my belly button and mostly on my right side, he was in a heads down position around the 20 weeks mark, he didn't flip flop much , he kinda prefers one side of me over the other, now at 38 weeks he is constantly kicking my right ribs/side and I can see/feel his feet stretching out, and now since he's dropped, I can feel his punches on my inner pelvis, also he headbutts my cervix quite frequently (OW!)
BabyBumps X I definitely felt most of the movements down low, esp. when I was right around 20-25 weeks. In my case, my midwife said the baby is probably just sitting low in my pelvis. Now that I'm 34 weeks I feel them, well, everywhere! 
TwoXChromosomes X That is scary! Hope you are peeing negatives! The IUD is practically no maintenance - one check every month. I love it - have the ParaGuard. No hormones, no related weight gain, regular periods! Not to mention, no condom, haha.  
TwoXChromosomes X Oh I agree entirely, it is worth it to get the vaccine. I just remember being so shocked when I found out because I thought it was nearly impossible to get a cancer-causing form of HPV (like the strain I have) after getting the vaccine.
TwoXChromosomes X They test the blood in the US too. They will contact you if you are HIV positive. I think the above person is just being over cautious. 
TwoXChromosomes X Try many different ways on your own. Cross your legs and use those powerful muscles down there while looking at porn/reading erotica. Make sure to turn yourself on first. Try a vibrator. Use your whole hand over top of your clothes. You don't even have to be naked.   Most women can orgasm much easier with clitoral stimulation than with intercourse. Especially with oral sex which is usually more pleasurable than the partner's hands.   Sometimes it can take 15-20 mins to work up to. So don't rush things. 
TwoXChromosomes X I used to chain my birth control pills so that I'd only have a period once a year or so, after asking my GYN.  However, I had an abnormal pap right after this, so out of (unfounded) paranoia I haven't skipped a period since.  I would skip one if it would be more convenient, for example if I were traveling, but with my menstrual cup I don't even notice having periods anymore.
TwoXChromosomes X I think part of the reason they are so stigmatized is to encourage teenagers in health class that it is worth their time to protect themselves. It is hard to make STDs something to protect yourself against without painting them in a horrendous light.   But I agree with you. STDs happen, and not just because people are being stupid or careless. 
BabyBumps X It is really important to ask your OBGYN about their cesearean, episiotomy, and overall intervention rates. If they're c-section rate is above 30% you might want to rethink that particular one.  Also, midwives are just as qualified as OBGYNs and usually can provide more involved, personal care. I'm a doula and midwifery student and getting a doula is also an excellent option. _use_a_doula.php  Good luck and congratulations!
TwoXChromosomes X I had abnormal results. Nothing was up. They said not to wait another two years for a PAP until my results were normal.
TwoXChromosomes X The worst part for me (besides the cramps, of course) is the constant feeling of having to poop. Does anyone else get that? It SUCKS.
TwoXChromosomes X Generic versions of drugs are chemically identical to name brands.  Either he switched you to a different dose/medication, or something else is the problem.  Just fyi.
BabyBumps X As far as I understand it, the slight bleeding could be placenta implanting. I wouldn't say miscarriage unless there is heavier bleeding and cramping. Trust your body, rest. Drink water. Wait. Relax. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X This is actually how I describe my cramps to people. It's just feeling like you have the worst diarrhea in the world but (for me, anyway) not being able to go. Couple that with back pain and hot/cold flashes. Just imagine having the worst diarrhea cramps of your life but for 3-5 days straight. 
BabyBumps X No. I'm not mad. If I had to get a c section I would. Actually, I probably will have to with this baby because I had so many complications with my first. I guess I just don't understand why you would want a c section if you didn't need one. You are right, every woman gets to make her own decisions but why plan a c section ahead of time before even trying to do it the old fashioned way? Isn't the down time for a c section a lot more than a vaginal delivery? Why go through a major surgery for your baby to be born when your body is equipped to birth a baby on it's own. That is, of course, if there are no medical reason or complications where a c section is necessary. I don't know why I even worded that comment the way I did, I had just woke up and kind of out of it I guess. Not trying to offend anyone, just very curious. 
BabyBumps X Once i hit the third trimester it totally disappeared. I feel every ache and pain, moving around is cumbersome and i just feel fat.  It will change throughout your pregnancy though:)
BabyBumps X Drink A LOT of water.  And urinate frequently (don't hold it in).  And, of course, wipe front to back :)  Make sure if you do the cranberry juice that it's not a cocktail - you need 100% cranberry juice, otherwise, it can actually make matters worse!
TwoXChromosomes X If I've been masturbating with a vibrator it makes it pretty hard to get into the rhythm with using just my fingers and by then it may be too much work to even finish. 
TwoXChromosomes X Because wearing a pad  feels like you're wearing a diaper. o.O  The pads never stay in place, they wad up and feel like you're carrying (pardon my frank words) a load in your shorts. And no -it doesn't matter how "small" the pad or liner is or if it has "wings" etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, wearing a pad is not comfy to me. It's like a little diaper and there's the wetness and all. Just not for me.  If you've inserted the tampon correctly, you shouldn't be able to feel it. I prefer them. Also, more beneficial if you're wearing a swim suit or have as a lifeguard or something similar. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've tried tampons and yes they are more convenient for active times but for the day to day I prefer pads. I don't like pulling them out, it feels weird and can get unnecessarily messy. They're not comfy for me and I don't like that string. Am I supposed to change my tampon every time I pee or do I walk around with a piss infused piece of yarn in my panties? Personally I feel like I have more control and understanding of how things are progressing by using pads. But I also prefer glasses to contacts. They're just so much easier therefore make more sense to me. I'm not dexterous for either.   The best brand out there right now is hands down Always Infinicel. They do a great job of controlling moisture levels and soak up and hold a surprising amount. 
TwoXChromosomes X There is no medical definition of the term "partial birth," so it's applied to several different types of procedures that result in an intact fetal corpse, apparently.  But in many cases, the choices are to do that, or to dismember the fetus internally... so it's usually done when the family has requested an intact body for grieving and burial (in other words, NOT for elective abortions).
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds like a UTI. Even if it's not, you should always listen to medication labels that say to see a doctor right away. You MUST get treatment for a UTI right away. They progress very quickly and the pain can get to a point where it's literally unbearable and you'll end up in the hospital, or it can lead to a serious kidney infection. You can also develop permanent damage to your urinary tract (aka trouble holding your pee for life). It's too late for cranberry juice. Find a walk-in clinic that's open. There will be one somewhere.   Seriously, if your medicine says alert a doctor right away, do it. You don't want to end up with something permanent or even life threatening that you could have prevented.  Edit: FYI, all they do to check for a UTI is make you pee in a cup. It's a really quick and easy appointment.
TwoXChromosomes X They are exactly like a miracle. Once you get the hang of it, they allow you to go through your day mostly forgetting you have your period. No stray cotton pieces up there, no wet pad, no uncomfortable dryness from using a tampon on a light day. And it's easier than most think to handle to emptying and cleaning. 
TwoXChromosomes X I use Instead for everyday, which are disposable. I also carry a silicone one for emergency. It's not a big deal since it hold so much that you only need to change it twice a day and I don't have to do it in public restrooms. I'm not grossed out by blood though. 
BabyBumps X You don't.  I wanted a med-free birth.  I ended up with an epidural, pitocin, then a c-section because my baby didn't want to descend, even though I was fully dilated.  Shit happens.  
BabyBumps X Where are you located?  As for you try not to worry. We have clotting disorders in my family and everyone is fine (I luckily did not get it). Cramping is normal so is some pain in your cervix. It's called growing pains. It hurts and it sucks. TRY to relax you are fine.  Unless the blood is red and you are passing clots YOU ARE FINE. Plenty of women spotted during pregnancy and have a healthy baby. I would get a high risk OB and try to relax.  Drink LOTS of water since being dehydrated can cause bad cramping.
TwoXChromosomes X My bestest friend, C, has always recommended Diva cups (or the like) which she claims is very comfortable ( and sustainable if that is important to you). There have been discussions on them here in TwoX-land and I will try to post links when I find them.   Personally, I prefer the tidiness of tampons over pads and find them generally more comfortable. After a few days though, they are all uncomfortable and I am mostly ready to be done with the whole mess. Still, tampons &gt; pads once you learn to use them comfortably.   Oh! Try the slightly smaller ones in beginning and use pad as back-up.  Helped me early on when I was still figuring how the dickens they worked. 
BabyBumps X This, this this!  I have a game plan, but I also have a back up plan.  I've done research as well as talking with my OB about the various interventions so may be required and what the hospital's policy is on administering those interventions.  My hope is that I won't need any, but I also want to be educated so that if it does come to the worst, I'm prepared to make a decision.  Expect the best but plan for the worst.
TwoXChromosomes X You don't get your period when your pregnant (unless that information is wrong too), so there must be a way to stop it some how. I have a hard time believing that with modern tech we don't have a solution.   ~~Oh, birth control pills apparently stop your period~~ ~~Nope they don't.~~  &gt;The first extended-cycle pill regimens introduced provide active hormone pills every day for three months, then one week of placebo pills (Seasonale) or low-dose estrogen pills (Seasonique, LoSeasonique). You'll experience menstrual bleeding during that week. A newer extended-cycle regimen is designed to be taken continuously for one year (Lybrel). It's meant to suppress all menstrual bleeding.  Some do.
TwoXChromosomes X To the best of my knowledge, TSS mostly only happens to women who forget that they are wearing a tampon for quite a while- whether they accidentally put 2 in or forget to take it out when they are almost done with their period (like maybe it is the last tampon you were planning on using at the end of your period)  
TwoXChromosomes X My son is now 20 months old (and such a cutie). My periods have always been unpredictable so the warning signs are mostly what I go by (but there's always the scumbag one that catches you off guard). For 6 days I was thinking....hmmm sore lower back, crying at tv shows, eating ALL the things...should be any day now. My husband and I had had unprotected sex once. We were in the beginning of "if it happens, it happens". So on the sixth day I bought a test thinking no way but if period isn't here by the morning I will test. Lo and behold... I was pregnant! I did three tests that morning just to be sure. We couldn't have been happier. But be warned...for me the symptoms were EXACTLY the same and I had no sore nips etc. this was after only one try. Thank god I've always used protection in the past ;) the timing was perfect and now we have our gorgeous boy.
TwoXChromosomes X Find your cervix. Mine sits in a weird spot, so I have to position my cup *just so* or I will experience leaks. Then, once you have your cup in, check to make sure that it is aimed at your cervix and isn't placed up next to it (past it) and that it isn't facing the wrong way.
TwoXChromosomes X I always poke through all the little holes every month - when they get clogged it really doesn't work. And for some reason my MoonCup (US) appears to be defective in this regard.  Upon insertion I don't aim it toward my tailbone. I just don't seem shaped that way (I do know that I'm shaped differently, though, as many of my organs including birthing ones are re-arranged. It's a birth defect). The key with insertion, for me, is to get it in as far as I can, and then aim for an inch further (although really, it's more like a 1/2").  Once inserted I give it a sharp yank downward. Hard. If I can feel the suction (it sort of hurts) then it's good. If not then I take it out and try again.
BabyBumps X I think the point she was trying to make is that they might not.  My BP spiked and I was induced even through I really wanted a natural labor that happened on its own.  Yes, you can plan... that doesn't mean your labor will go according to plan.
TwoXChromosomes X The vicious cycle is that you stress out about your period, and the stress might actually delay your period even more. You should take a blood test since it's much more accurate than a pee test.D:  *edit* oh gods how did I miss the spelling error?
TwoXChromosomes X This could have been written by me, pretty much word for word! Except I'm 22. Missed period for 3 months, 3 home tests negative, and I was waiting to start taking the pill again once my period came (to make me regular again, and to stay not-pregnant of course).   I went back to the doctor, they pregnancy tested me, it was negative. Then they tested my thyroid &amp; pituitary (just in case these other issues were causing missed periods) and those results came back normal.   The doctor told me to just start my pill again anyway, that same day, and that it must have been stress or change in life-style, etc. So, a few days ago (into my 3rd week on the pill) Ii started my period. It's gonna take at least a month before I'm regular (periods come as scheduled) again I'm guessing, but I'm so happy to have my period back, I'm hardly complaining about cramps at all!!   You will probably be fine. But go to the doctor if you can!
TwoXChromosomes X When I got mine put in, my doctor warned me that this was the number 1 reason girls get it removed. For the record, my first period on implanon lasted for 2 straight weeks and the cramps were unbearable. But I have been having fairly normal periods (although they come every 6 weeks or so) since then.
TwoXChromosomes X For me, it was like the start of a SUPER light period that only lasted for an hour or so. It was never bright red, sometimes it was the dark grungy, old blood looking stuff. I've had a few more moments of spotting since and it's always had that characteristic. Now, that's my body, and I'm not normally a light bleeder.  FWIW, I'm pregnant now. I thought my period was starting when I had implantation bleeding a few days before normal start. (After taking a test and having it come up negative).
TwoXChromosomes X This. Omg...this this this. I wish people would stop saying women are having periods while pregnant. It's impossible. What they are experiencing is a differernt type of vaginal bleeding. 
BabyBumps X Hey, I just saw this article today and thought it was really relevant. -risk-pregnancies-birth-choices  In the UK, the NHS will pay for birth in a hospital, at home attended by a midwife, and in a dedicated birthing center. This is going to give much better stats than the US where uninsured women might choose a homebirth because it's cheaper but insured women would likely go with a hospital birth because insurance basically never pays for homebirth, and etc.  If you look in the article it's got stats for transfer rates for first time mothers vs multiparas (mothers who've given birth before) who attempted homebirth. It also has rates of negative outcomes for the different birthing methods, and intervention rates. It probably doesn't surprise you that mothers who started out birthing at home, and then transfered to hospital, still had lower rates of forceps delivery and c section than those who started out in hospital.   Of course there are still issues in that mothers who had complications or who desire medical management of their births are more likely to plan a hospital birth in the first place. But still I think you would find this useful. 
BabyBumps X It's better than mine...  I get 6 weeks short-term disability at 60% salary + any vacation time I have available (I'll have accrued 2 weeks, 100% salary).  To continue medical benefits, I will have to pay the Employee-Paid deduction out-of-pocket (I think it's still pre-tax).     FMLA allows me to take up to 4 months leave (whatever isn't covered under STD or Vacation is unpaid), but I can't afford to take unpaid time off.  My husband gets 0 days for leave.
BabyBumps X &gt;The federal government has recently introduced paid maternity leave benefits so I will get 18 weeks of about $500 a week  Aaannnddd I'm moving to Australia. 
BabyBumps X 22 weeks and have gained 20 lbs, am 5' 3" and normally 118 prior to getting pregnant. oddly i still fit in twos and 4s and everyone tells me i still look fairly thin. my mom (5 feet tall) gained 50 lbs with me and lost 40 at birth; 4 more weeks and the other 10 was off. i hope i have her luck. 
TwoXChromosomes X Urine hormone detection kits work 10-11 days after conception. Ultrasound detects the embryo at about 3 weeks, sometimes a little earlier. Don't know about the blood test.  If her periods are very irregular she might have [PCOS]( _ovary_syndrome). I have the same syndrome and have had several pregnancy scares due to my irregular periods.
BabyBumps X I didn't start actually showing until about 24 weeks, but most of that is because I'm already overweight. 
BabyBumps X My first was a boy too and i secretly wanted a girl but i am beyond relieved its a boy because i know how to raise one of those already LOL 
BabyBumps X no trust me... the penis was way out there LOL. The ultrasound tech said she has seen genitals as early as 11 weeks. We got lucky that his legs were open. -ultrasound.shtml  "but some newer ultrasound technology can determine the babys gender as early as 12 or 13 weeks." I'm actually closer to the 14 week mark than the 13 week mark as well.
TwoXChromosomes X also, using a condom with your pill is just fine! ive been with my boyfriend for 10 years, been on the pill for 5 years, i am like you, i cant 'trust' it. i like the added physical barrier idea!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm an older lady on her second Paraguard.  Obviously I am pleased.  First the bad, it can hurt during implantation.  The first time my gyn gave me something to relax me and dilate my cervix slightly and it wasn't bad.  The second time I had nothing and it hurt like a son of a bitch.  I'm sure the nurse who let me hold her hand had a bruise.  If your doctor isn't planning on a little something to ease the discomfort I'd suggest self medication with your favorite, safe relaxant.  Have a friend drive you.  Yes, the periods are a little heavier and crampier at first by gradually subside to normal.  After that you mostly forget it's there.
TwoXChromosomes X Also, as far as clots go- what about a non estrogen type of BC? Have your doctors ruled those out too? They let me use them despite a risk of stroke with migraines with aura.
TwoXChromosomes X Go to a good doctor. Pain before/during/after sex is one of the reasons to see a doctor/gyno.  If it was just your hymen, it would be a superficial pain.  Don't put up with pain during sex, as your body is warning you to stop to prevent damage.  Best of luck finding out the cause and for getting better!  I had sexual pain that prevented me from ever having intercourse, but I saw my doctor and got referred on to treatment. Now I know what to do to make it all work painlessly.
TwoXChromosomes X If the pain doesn't get better, I will go to a doctor for sure. And it didn't really hurt DURING sex, but I could just not have noticed it. At this point I just think we were probably too rough, and things got sore down there, but I worry about things a lot, so my mind keeps thinking of internal bleeding and flipped organs or something.  Thanks so much for the advice. :)
BabyBumps X Myself, I have only gained 10 pounds. Doctor says I'm right on track since I'm over weight and my total goal is 20 pounds.  However... my best friend, who is 5 foot 2 and weighed 115 pre-pregnancy gained 70 pounds, most of it water weight. She had to go on the Atkins diet for a couple months to lose the extra weight. She did have some complications, but I don't believe the additional weight was connected to the complications. I also had a co-worker who was a little taller than my friend, and she gained about 100 pounds during her pregnancy. She had a completely healthy baby boy and lost all the weight in weeks with regular exercise.   Moral of the story... talk with your doctor if you're nervous about your weight gain, but as long as you're eating healthy, getting some exercise and there aren't any complications, I doubt s/he will be very concerned.
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely try monitoring your [base body temperature]( #2). Temperatures rise after ovulation and once they have been up for 3 days you are completely infertile until your period. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you track your cycle every month, you can pinpoint ovulation to 14 days before your period started.  Not everyone has a 28 day cycle where they ovulate exactly 2 weeks from the first day of your last period, but most luteal phases (the second half) are 14 days. Avoid sex until the week before your period is due and the first week during your period/just after, and you are probably safe. Any other time up to a week before ovulation and 2 days after you are asking for pregnancy if you have vaginal intercourse, even if he pulls out (which you are against anyways.). There are ovulation predictor kits out there that will let you know if you are ovulating, but if you are in tune with your body and Mark your calendar, you dont need it.  Really- even the dollar tree sells them.  Good luck. Edit: guess I should say my source is having two pregnancies- one unintentionally via pull out method, and one planned (14 days before my period was due.)
TwoXChromosomes X I don't understand where people get the notion that child birth (let alone a child) is a fitting punishment for such a mistake as unprotected sex.  **Edit:** I made a mistake with this comment as it doesn't quite fit with the context. What I mean is, I don't get where people get the idea that child birth is meant as a punishment for unprotected sex. E.G., the argument that if you have unprotected sex and have an unwanted pregnancy as a result, you should not be allowed to get an abortion because raising a child is the appropriate punishment for your actions. I now realise that this is not what gnarlymarlee was saying.
TwoXChromosomes X I use one and love it.    It is way more comfy than tampons and way cleaner than pads - nothing worse than the feeling of a blood smeared vagina on a sweaty day.  I cut the stem off of mine and found that it was much more comfortable.  It did take me a few days to find the insertion position that was most comfortable - the first few times I tried it didn't really work out.  I would probably get a few panty liners for your first time around JIC.  I clean it using diva wash or mild soap and water.  I can leave it in all day, so there really isn't a concern about emptying it out and washing it in public.  I boil it occasionally (usually just before period time) just to sanitize.      I keep it in while I pee - unlike a tampon there is no string or parts that get peed on.  
BabyBumps X I lost 20 pounds at the hospital, and within 2 weeks had lost 10 more pounds (not trying, mind you, I was basically laying around the house with my baby being waited on hands/feet by friends/family, and I was eating like a hog post partum).  I gained 42 pounds in my pregnancy and was back to prepreg weight by 8 months fairly easy (most of that time was just the last 12 pounds slowly creeping off, though... not spending months way overweight).
TwoXChromosomes X What has the doctor told you? Have you thought about endometriosis? This may explain the heavy periods and so much pain every month. You could investigate Depo Provera, which is a birth control shot which lasts for 3 months at a time, I believe. You should really speak with a doctor , though, and read into endometriosis. It's better to know what you are dealing with,  instead of just dealing with the pain and heavy bleeding each month.  If you are absolutely sure that you never want children, you could consider a hysterectomy, but honestly it should be a last resort, after trying other methods of therapy.  Also take into consideration, that you will be hard-pressed to find a doctor who will perform a hysterectomy on you because you are so young, and given that you seem to not have any medical records regarding your condition.  And, of course, if you did have a hysterectomy, you will need to take hormones for the next few decades. I believe it's called add-back therapy.  Please to go to a doctor, it sounds like it could be endo, or some other illness. You don't have to suffer! :-) Keep us updated, I wish you the best.
TwoXChromosomes X It gets much easier with practice! The most important thing is to figure out the best way for you to relax your pelvic muscles. I learned to insert mine by lying on my bed with my knees bent (PAP exam style), with a dark towel under my hips in case of spillage. You could also do this in the bathtub (when it's not full of water).  It can also help to use a bit of water-based lube on the outside of the cup (not silicone since it'll bond to the silicone Diva cup) to help ease it in more comfortably.  Other than that, following the instructions (i.e., pinching it into a "U" shape before inserting, then giving it a little twist so the cup opens back into an "O") seemed to work for me.  One more thing... It's important to insert it as far as you can. You can't push it in too far, but if you don't push it in far enough it can be uncomfortable. If you're worried about not being able to remove it after, have no fear. It will always come back out. All you need to do is bear down (like you're having a bowel movement) and then you can pinch the base of the cup and take it out.  Good luck with it. Now that I'm used to using it, the Diva cup is the best thing that's ever happened to me!
TwoXChromosomes X **TMI ALERT!**    I do it sitting on the toilet. I fold it into a seven (someone itt linked to a bunch of different folds - you should try all of them and see what works best for you, I tried a bunch before landing on the seven), spit allllll over it and the thumb/finger I'm holding it with (gross, I know!) and insert while pushing out with my pelvic muscles to help keep things open.    At first I was trying to insert ONLY the cup, which didn't work for me. Personally, I have to push in the cup and ALSO the thumb and finger I'm holding the cup with. I don't recall seeing reference to anywhere when I was learning, but for me, that was the secret to getting it all the way in. Once it's in there (past the initial bony ridge and into the soft squishy part), you should insert a finger and run it around the outside of the cup to make sure it's unfolded completely and therefore created the suction needed to work. Sometimes the cup won't unfold all the way by itself, in which case you need to use a finger to poke it and force it to flex outwards, or bump it upwards, further towards your cervix.     I hope that this helps you and that nobody ever goes through my comment history. :D If I was unclear about anything please ask, learning to get the cup to really work for me as intended was a struggle for me so I know where you're at. 
TwoXChromosomes X If it's not just rubbed raw, it sounds like herpes. And if it is, don't freak out. You might have come up negative on the last test, but I recommend going the rounds again because this sounds like textbook herpes. Herpes really isn't as big a deal as high school sex ed makes it sound. I'm a pathology undergrad who knows enough about virology to say that a surprising number of people have the genital herpes virus and have no idea. Either they never display symptoms, or they just haven't yet (like your case).   "Herpes" is actually an entire category of viruses. They are human pathogens (meaning they've co-evolved with us, and thus don't really do anything bad to their beloved hosts) that stay with us for our entire lives. upwards of 90% of the population is infected with multiple strains of HPV since infancy, and about 80% of those infected carry at least one known carcinogenic strain (but obviously most don't get cancer). A similar percentage are infected with multiple herpes viruses, like chicken pox! Chicken pox is a type of herpes, that stays dormant within you for the rest of your life. Genital herpes lives in the nerves connected to the flair-up spot, lying dormant until things like stress, UV light, or weird hormonal fluctuations allow them to travel down into the skin and start up their reproductive cycle. Herpes sores can be itchy and annoying, but that's all they are.  Our culture tends to be totally wacky when it comes to STDs (though most of these "S"TDs we don't get through sex; see HPV), so don't think that you're suddenly marked for life as unsex-able. It just means you have to mention it if you've having sex during a flair up, and be prepared with the research to put on the spiel about how herpes is totally not a big deal.  And then again, maybe you're just having an allergic reaction or some other type of infection. But on the chance it's herpes, I just wanted to reassure you that it's seriously no big deal :)
TwoXChromosomes X Run it under cold water before you insert it, it helps it to pop open. The LJ community that's been posted is incredible. I use the punch-down fold, and sometimes some lube, and it's great. Once it's in, run your finger around the edge to make sure it's open, if you can turn it while it's in you then it's open enough. I always have to poke my cervix up so it goes inside the cup! It was a really steep learning curve for me, but I'd never go back to only pads, 5 years with the cup now!
TwoXChromosomes X Everyone seems to have posted all the big secrets, the lj page and community are super helpful. Once mine's in (with a U fold), if I can't get it to "pop," this little trick never fails: give it an extra shove and then a quick, tiny tug with a twist. That usually makes the suction cooperate! Also, of yours is brand new and a tad bit pokey, you can trim that stem off-- I cut mine all the way to the cup and found that its way more comfortable (you just have to get more personal when removing). Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Yep! They are required in most states to ask that as part of the counseling session.
TwoXChromosomes X I think about 20% of people experience no periods at all but most women stop experiencing a real period but have occasional spotting. Of the three people I know who have mirena all of them stopped having periods. I would definitely say try it out before having a hysterectomy. It doesn't have to stay in for the full five years, and if after 6 months your still getting periods you can look at a different option. Make sure you give your body time to adjust though... It takes awhile for things to adjust once you start. There is an online community called IUD_Divas that has a lot of great info and personal stories. If I wasn't on my phone I'd link it for you. 
TwoXChromosomes X I know that is an 8th grader, I was 14 once too.  I personally feel that 14 is too young as well but the fact of the matter is that kids are likely to have sex anyway so we might as well be open about it and encourage them to use birth control if they do decide to have sex. Studies have shown that abstinence only education does not reduce sexual activity, it only makes those kids less likely to use condoms and other birth control methods.    Whether or not you think it is too young, it is happening and we have to prepare kids to do the safe thing. 
TwoXChromosomes X You should try for at least 6 months, more likely a year depending on your age. You have a 20% chance of conceiving every month. Conception is not an exact science. If you're going to get stressed about it, you can chart your cycle. 
BabyBumps X I found out that I have a Protein S deficiency with my third pregnancy and did twice daily heparin injections right up until my delivery.  Protein S deficiency increases the likelihood of blood clots and we suspect may have been the cause of several miscarriages before #3.  I had no problems at all with the injections.  I saw an excellent perinatologist who recommended the treatment and now I have a fabulously fat and healthy baby boy!  
TwoXChromosomes X This guy is completely correct.  I'm a guy who absolutely loves going down on women, but it loses most (if not all) of its luster when the woman either can't cum from it, or it takes fucking forever for her to get off *and* she is really bad at giving any kind of indication or directions as to what would help to put her over the top.  Performing oral sex on a woman is not easy, I've even had bi women confirm for me that it's more physically difficult to go down on women than it is to go down on men.  While it is very enjoyable for me, if you get the feeling that it's not going anywhere or if you don't really get a good sense that what you're specifically doing at the moment either is or isn't working, then it becomes very frustrating.  I imagine nobody would be particularly thrilled to go down on a guy if it wasn't going to get him to cum and if you had no real clue if what you were doing was having much effect or not.    So my advice to you would be that if you're not gonna cum, you should at least make a big show of how good it feels and let him know what he's doing is working and what isn't, so he can have some sense that he's doing the right thing.  Don't ever fake an orgasm, but you should really play up how enjoyable it is at the very least.  
TwoXChromosomes X Well, for one, the plastic slides out easier then a bunch of dry cotton does, like you would get towards the end of your period.  And menstrual fluid is just that, menstrual fluid. It washes out. You have to wash your hands after you go to the restroom anyway.
Parenting X I'm so sorry to hear this.  I had a m/c at 11 weeks, then luckily got pregnant about two months later.  I now have an amazing 13 month old sitting next to me!  It is awful and traumatic, but you will all get through this!
TwoXChromosomes X My gyno was borderline *pushing* an IUD on me. Why would being young or unmarried be a problem? IUDs are reversible, and the new IUDs have a much lower risk of infection.  When did you try to get an IUD? They were very unpopular for a while but they're coming back in style. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was at my doctor last week and she gave me this advice to prevent yeast infections: 1. Wear 100% cotton underwear 2. Jeans/pants that have any lycra in them trap moisture in- I guess this means to change into something else when you get home or find something else to wear during the day 3. Eat probiotic yogurt (or if you're like me and hate yogurt you can get the probiotics separate at the pharmacy)
BabyBumps X You really need to bring up all these concerns with her.  She can't force you to induce.  However, I will tell you I was induced for both my pregnancies (difference reasons) and I didn't have a c-section for either.  Hell, for my last one, I didn't even have any pain meds and they say labour with induction is more painful or intense than without.  So...if you do happen to get induced, it certainly does NOT mean you'll have a c-section, there are many different factors that go into that.
TwoXChromosomes X Oh agreed! And on the flipside, consider the lovely GYN I had who seriously tried to convince me that the pill was not for me and spermicide was just as convenient and effective.
TwoXChromosomes X I have an IUD and I have no kids.  Insertion is a little more painful and the chance of expulsion is slightly higher, but that doesn't actually mean that you're not a candidate anymore.  Most doctors don't even blink at giving them to nulliparous women anymore.  It does hurt to have it inserted, but it's just like bad cramps and it's over in a few seconds.  I love mine.  And really, an IUD is about the same cost as an abortion, and if you have insurance an IUD should be covered.  I'm on my second one, and I never paid a penny for either.  I got my first one from Planned Parenthood, where I qualified for a free IUD through the Arch Foundation for low income women.  I just had it replaced last month, and this time it was covered 100% by my insurance with no copay.  
BabyBumps X i'm wondering if maybe part of the reason she wants to induce is because i might actually *want* an epidural - my initial plan was to ride it out and see how long i could go without pain meds but i definitely wasn't opposed to an epi if it got bad enough. if i'm induced and can stop my heparin shots beforehand, an epidural will still be an option for me. 
BabyBumps X Red raspberry leaf tea tones the uterus, but doesn't help bring on labor, which is why my midwife had me start drinking it well before the point of viability.  However, nipple stimulation may help. I was already getting contractions for 4 weeks before I had my daughter and the nipple stimulation DID make them stronger, though it never threw me into fullblown labor.
TwoXChromosomes X I mean, clinics getting bombed and patients being hassled is awful and a huge concern, but I'm willing to bet that the protesters know exactly where all the clinics are already.   As I said in an earlier comment, the inclusion is CPCs but not abortion providers is what is really scary. 
TwoXChromosomes X You might have kidney stones or you might have pyelonephritis, a UTI that has traveled up your ureters and is now in your kidneys. DO NOT FUCK AROUND WITH THIS! Yes we have two kidneys, but this should not be viewed as having a "spare". ;)   Seriously though.  *edited to add: or you might have both. A big kidney stone can block the opening between your kidney and its ureter and cause an infection to brew in that kidney.
TwoXChromosomes X I know you don't use tampons for discharge, it just sucks that having to wear uncomfortable pads for a week is followed by having to wear liners which feel similar to pads.
TwoXChromosomes X 1. I have a pretty small vagina and they don't hurt me. 2. They aren't unbearably cold. Just colder than you are. Room temperature compared to the inside of your vagina which is very hot. 3. Not very long at all. They don't "stare", they check out your stuff, take some samples, and that's it. 4. I have a feeling that won't happen. But if it does, so what? You'll just have you buy yourself a speculum so you can use it at home. ;P 5. Probably not. They've seen a lot of lady parts so yours shouldn't be some kind of surprise. 6. I take ibruprophen beforehand because I'm super sensitive down there and when they scrape for samples (sometimes with q-tip thingies) it hurts. It reminds me of a strep test, but inside my vagina. 7. I've never queefed on the table. But again, they've probably had weirder things happen.  Just go in there with a "They've seen worse" attitude, and you'll be fine. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm going to offer the unpopular opinion here: research your options.   The US is uniquely alone in some gynecologists aggressively recommending pap smears to teenagers and young women despite there being little to no medical literature supporting the use of early pap screens, and I'm assuming that's where you're from.   For comparison, in the UK, screening starts at -25- for sexually active women. Not because they don't believe that women younger than that have sex, but because there's a very limited value to testing when you're young: your chances of developing cervical cancer are extraordinarily low, whereas your chances of having a positive worry you, lead to needless examination, and clear up on it's own are quite high.   Even in the US, perhaps still too aggressively, ACOG now recommends screening at 21 and screening every two years until you're 30 (and every three years thereafter). For comparison, Australia recommends screening every two years, and the UK recommends screening every three to five years.   Consider your options. Yes, this exam is unlikely to physically harm you, but it can lead to needless worries and needless additional testing- but is very very unlikely to help save your life at this point in time.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, positive. You've never had a physical exam where she palpated your innards with one hand while her fingers were in your vagina supporting those innards? Feeling from the outside abdomen can't give the doc an idea of what they might feel on the underside.
TwoXChromosomes X The're rubber cups about the size of a shot glass (but a bit more narrow) with a little handle on the bottom. You put it in the back of your vagina and the rubber suctions to your cervix, collecting all of the menstrual blood. You just bend it to break the seal and use the pull tab to get it out. Empty it a few times a day, clean it and put that sucker back in.  Then have ALL the sex!
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you SO much for your experience in this. I've been researching today on IUDs and they seem much less scary than I expected. If I go for one, I would most likely get the copper. I would go for mirena, but it's not cheap and the Paragard lasts longer. I am worried about the side effects of it, but it seems like it might be a good fit for me. I don't think it's as cheap in the states, but if it will seriously work for me, it's worth any expense to stop what I'm dealing with now.
TwoXChromosomes X Some poking and prodding in uncomfortable places, but overall probably not the most awful thing you've ever done in your life :) And I know when I go in for my checkups, they're usually pretty quick too.  &gt; because of the fear of the fear of the metal stretchy thing lol.  It isn't as bad as it sounds, surprisingly enough. Again, not fluffy kittens, but I've never actually had *pain* so much as discomfort with it.  Mentally, it depends on your mindset going in. Nothing he/she sees down there is going to surprise them, I'm sure they've seen it all--so that's one thing you don't have to worry about! Just think: it can't get much more awkward than having your own mom as your GYN. Heyo!  Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X If you shave, you're more likely to get a lecture about the dangers of infection from ingrown hairs, etc. Gynecologists look at so many vaginas, don't even worry about some hair.  As for pain, remember to breath as normally as you can and try to relax your vaginal muscles (kind of like you're trying to pee). The speculum is really only in there for about 20 seconds for a quick look and swab.  If your mom knows you're going to get your first pap, she may be able to come in the room and hold your hand. My mom did :)
TwoXChromosomes X I purchased a Diva cup and I love many things about it (especially the idea) however the cup is just too long for me.  The stem (that I've basically cut entirely off) rubs against me uncomfortably whenever I insert it and I just cannot handle it anymore.  I have gone back to using tampons until I cave and buy a shorter cup from another brand (probably stemless)
TwoXChromosomes X If you want to find out if you have an infection before going to the Gyno, you can by a testing kit. I had the same issue. I knew right away something was different and the only symptom I had was the smell. It never got bad enough to notice other than fingering and smelling, but that was enough for me. I took the test and sure enough it showed that the ph level was off. I read about natural treatments for it and did that instead of going to the doctor. I took acidophilus, garlic, and douched with a water and hydrogen peroxide mix once a day, which seemed to work the best. It left and came back a couple times over a couple months but I took a final test which showed it was normal and it has not comeback since then, and that was ten months ago. It's always best to go to the doctor, but they will just give you antibiotics which will kill all the good and bad bacteria. If you go that route, be sure to take acidophilus to build back up the good.
BabyBumps X 11 weeks and I totally have a very noticeable round bump. I am pretty short though.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks, I appreciate it.  I'm thinking of going to my general doctor for the appt, so I expect it will be pretty quick and since I don't have a sexual history she might want to skip the full exam (but I think bc of my age- 26- I need the whole shebang).
BabyBumps X &gt;I switched to taking Floradix  Ugh!  Floradix!  The bain of my existence!  I switched to Floradix because I wasn't tolerating the iron pills.  I feel 10x better- but for that minute twice a day when I have to down the horrid stuff!  One question tho- was the Iron prescribed?  I know iron tablets are available OTC, but mine was actually prescribed and the pharmacist specifically told me not to take this with any milk, as the calcium would inhibit iron absorption.  Shame on your pharmacist or your OB for not telling you this!  Glad your levels are looking better!
BabyBumps X I doubt she is based on what you've described, but just go buy a test.  It's the only way to know for sure.  And it's not too early if she's already a day late, but if it's negative and she still doesn't get her period a week from now, test again.
BabyBumps X My bump grew gradually, I don't recall a time when I "popped."  I don't feel that I was "definitely pregnant" until about week 30, though some say it was obvious around week 25.  I was definitely pudgy before then, but I don't feel that you could tell if I had a "pot belly" or if I was pregnant.  Though over the past 10 weeks, I've grown much quicker and everyone seems to notice a drastic difference from week to week. 
BabyBumps X I forget when we went to hear the heartbeat for the first time, but I think it was around 10 or 12 weeks.  We just had the first ultrasound at 21 weeks, and that is the only one our doctor wants done.  If you aren't high-risk there's no reason to do more than one ultrasound.  Wait until closer to 20 weeks to get it done, the baby's moving around and doing cool stuff by then!
TwoXChromosomes X Soooo I had a doctor's appointment this morning that I thought was gonna be a baseline physical, and lo they decided I should have a pap (my last was in 2008). Surprise pap! Here it be:  - Nurse/clinician leads you to room. Answer preliminary questions like "What are you here for today?" and "When was the first day of your last period?" (always a puzzler)  - Receive gown and drape. Get left alone to change into them. Fold clothes neatly and hide underpants in the pile because I can't let the doctor see my underpants OMG!!1! Sit on paper on table like deli sandwich and wait.  - Doctor arrives. May not shake hands because of, you know, cooties. May ask you exactly same questions nurse/clinician asked you. Possibly this is a test. Your feet at this point will be bare and unsupported, causing shivering and increased feeling of awkwardness. This is normal.  - Doctor asks you to pull down gown for breast exam. This doctor had me stay sitting up and did it before the pelvic stuff. Some doctors do it after the pelvic stuff while you are still lying down. Involves firm but gentle circle motion palpating of the breast. Should in no way feel rough or painful. Takes about thirty seconds.   - Doctor may ask if anyone in family has had breast cancer. This helps pass the time. (During the breast exam I prefer to politely stare 5 inches off the doctor's shoulder.)  - Doctor listens to your lungs to test for, I dunno, sex pneumonia.  - Time for pelvic! From foot of table, doctor unfolds cold metal stirrups for you to rest your feet in. This helps acclimate you to cold things touching your body. Doctor asks you to scoot your caboose to the edge of the table and lie down. I tend to undershoot and have to be told to re-scoot. This is normal.  - Now your mileage may vary. This doctor didn't do the knee-slide (I love the knee-slide!) However she definitely told me what she was doing before she did it (something like "all right... you're going to feel the insertion.") I made an affirmative sound, but it was not required. Speculum feels like hard plastic, but at least ergonomic hard plastic. Then she said "Now I'm going to expand..." and there were two short clicks and I gasped and she said "Oh no, are you okay?" and I said "Oh, it's fine; it doesn't hurt," and then something about how it's good practice for mammograms and colonoscopies and all that and then we were having fun again.   I think the feeling is just a lot of room temperature air going where room temperature air never usually goes. It's like sitting on a cold toilet seat: startling, not your favorite thing to do, but quite all right if it's for a purpose.   The nerve endings in your vaginal walls and cervix are vague, sort of like when your foot goes to sleep. It doesn't feel like sexytimes, but if you get some sexy feeling from the whole thing that's not the weirdest thing in the world, and no one's gonna know or care or judge you for it.   - So then she said "All done," and removed the speculum. Then she stood up and said something like "Now let's take a look here" and inserted two fingers up my lady pipe and palpated my uterus and made me have to pee.   - All done! Time to sit up and talk about what comes next (lab results, what they mean, etc.)  - Then the doctor leaves so you can get dressed.  My doctor knew this wasn't my first rodeo and so skipped some exposition. Make it clear this is your first pap and you should be treated accordingly (LOTS of information, LOTS of prior warning.)  I understand your concerns about being weird or awkward because I had them, too. But it's flat out impossible for you to weird out your doctor. For fun you could TRY to be weird -- like, hang your underpants on the computer stand... or sing "Ave Maria" -- because that's what it would take to be even remotely novel here.  You're gonna be fine.
BabyBumps X I only got one at around 8w because I had lost track of my period. (That's why there was baby to begin with). It's more customary to just do the one at around 17, to check for length and toes and such.   I know that the earlier one actually can produce a lot of anxiety for ladies: if it's a little too early, they may not find heartbeat, and then they freak out and cry and worry, for no reason. So, relax, you'll see the little guy soon. 
TwoXChromosomes X Don't be nervous or scared. I always go in with a "They've heard worse" attitude. Haha.   I take on the same attitude when going to the doctor (specifically the gyno, I say "They've seen worse).  If you go in with that kind of attitude, it makes it easier. &lt;3
TwoXChromosomes X I tested negative for HPV so my doctor said it was a natural occurrence.  Even if you test positive for HPV, it may not be caused by it. Although if you test positive, you need to handle this carefully since cervical cancers are caused by it. Your boyfriend may want to get tested, but it doesn't impact him as much as you.   Again, hugs, this isn't easy at first, but the more you educate yourself and talk to doctors/people, the easier it gets. Again, this is a nuisance, and probably will only be that. 
BabyBumps X It will be around 12 weeks (every 4 weeks in the first and second trimester)   and yes, your doctor should do a doppler then. They tend to like to make sure the baby is doing good, and getting it's heart rate is part of that. Even my very-hands-off midwife does the doppler at each appointment, just to be sure baby is okay in there.
BabyBumps X 17 weeks? Wow, that's a long way away and I do not feel that is normal at all.  A heartbeat can be *seen* via ultrasound at the 7 week mark.  It flutters on screen and every woman I know has had their first ultrasound between 7 - 9 weeks.  I highly suggest you change your Dr.  Before anyone jumps down my throat about this - I am 39 years old and finally just over 7 months pregnant with my first.  I suffered a missed miscarriage last year and lost a daughter.  It was the most devastating thing I ever went through.  With a missed miscarriage, you have no idea anything is wrong (especially if it is your first pregnancy).    This time round, I got pregnant and had my first scan at 6 weeks and 3 days.  I saw baby's heartbeat flickering on screen.  They gave me a scan every week until I hit 10 weeks (I also had a fibroid they needed to monitor).  You do not need a weekly scan but one at the 7 - 9 week mark.  Of course this is completely dependent on how you feel about it too. If you are ok waiting 17 weeks, then there is nothing wrong with that either :)
TwoXChromosomes X Well, a few years ago I was taking metformin, which is a diabetes medicine, but because one of the causes of PCO is insulin resistance, I did loose a little weight. I wasn't able to stay on the meds though because I lost my insurance. I did get on that same medicine again recently, but then I got pregnant so weight loss is not on my mind right now.
BabyBumps X You wouldn't get implantation bleeding a month later, implantation bleeding would usually happen a week before your period (about 5-7 days after having sex). A pregnancy test will definitely tell you if you're pregnant by now, did you take one at all?
BabyBumps X I've had half a bottle of beer when I crave it. The doctor said one beer or one serving of wine is perfectly fine and does no harm to the baby.
TwoXChromosomes X For two days my flow is insane (~200 ml in those two days, the other days are extremely light). I have to empty my cup every 3-4 hours or it will overflow. I wear reusable pads as backup, because even if I'm vigilant, it just takes one super cramp and I'm overflowing. Sorry for TMI, but you did ask.
TwoXChromosomes X It looks bigger in person but once its inside of you, its like compacted so don't get scared or anything!! _in_hand.jpg  At first I was like "uh yeah thats not going to fit inside of me" but it slides right in (you squeeze it together and then insert it, I usually try to push mine up a bit with my finger) and you don't even notice it. My boyfriend says he doesn't really feel it during sex. Before we get into anything, I have him finger me and "push it up a bit". Once everything has kicked in, you can take it out for up to 2 hours without a problem, so if you don't feel comfortable having sex with it in then thats always an option as well. 
BabyBumps X Lol. Thank you. Ohh not before too long you'll finally have a round belly. I thought it took FOREVER too, haha. It's usually around the 25th week or so, I think when you get a pretty rounded belly. (Depending on your size.)
BabyBumps X Pushing hurt for me. It was a whole new pain different from what I went through for the past 17 hours. My birth was all natural except for an episiotomy to prevent further tearing. My baby was small too 5lbs 4oz (full term) and I only had to push 15 minutes.
BabyBumps X Popped around 15 weeks.  I still feel like some days I just look fat and bloated, and other days I look preggo... Sometimes it depends how I dress.  Maternity clothes definitely emphasize the bump.  Also, my belly feels hard almost all the time now, but when I first popped it would feel hard only after a meal, and the rest of the time it had some squish.    5'1"  1st pregnancy.   (I won't say what I weighed pre-pregnancy, just that I was overweight)
TwoXChromosomes X You let her go on believing what she wants. She's excited and those beliefs aren't hurting anyone. :)   Also if it is not her first pregnancy she may very well be feeling the baby earlier and showing earlier   I felt my son move at about 12 weeks, it wasn't kicking but felt like an odd fluttering and have had friends who showed slightly  as early as 8 weeks with their second kiddo.
BabyBumps X At my 38 week exam, the doctor hooked her finger inside my cervix and said she could touch the baby's head...   I suspect that my frequent Braxton-Hicks contractions and accompanying backache, are due to that... Even though my water has not broke, the finger inside the cervix must have disturbed the amniotic sac in some way...  I wish I can avoid the cervical exam this week.. I don't want to hasten labor unnecessarily. And everytime she examines me, she has nothing new to tell about the due date, so why examine at all?
BabyBumps X I was 50% effaced and 3-4 cm dilated and nothing happened till 40 weeks... Everyone is different, but I hope he stays till medically "Full-term"
BabyBumps X Yep and this completely made an issue for us with my first pregnancy. I was only 4 weeks along but from LMP I was closer to 7. I was charting so I knew but my ob wouldn't believe that I knew. Oh so frustrating!   
BabyBumps X It was very brief for me and didn't happen until after 9 cm.  Like everyone else, I don't have much of a concept of time, but I was 8 cm and coherent when we got to the hospital at 7:45, spent about 15 minutes in triage before getting to a room, my water broke 10 minutes after that, and I was still feeling in control and able to move around easily when the on-call doctor introduced himself and told me i was 9 cm.  Pushing only took 20 minutes and the baby was out at 9:02, so that means transition must have been less than a half hour and I think it was much less than that.  It didn't really hurt more than the rest of labor, I just felt completely out of control until I was pushing.
BabyBumps X Technically, there is no amount of alcohol proven to be safe for pregnant women.  But the amount given for communion is soooo small, and only once a week I'm assuming.  I wouldn't worry too much.
TwoXChromosomes X I have a Mirena! I do not have endometriosis, but I absolutely love mine. I had no issues with insertion (not exactly fun, but not painful either). I have had some light spotting and the first week had some cramping, but overall I wouldn't trade it for the Pill, ever again. But again, I don't have endometriosis, so obviously YMMV.
TwoXChromosomes X Planned Parenthood, I'd argue, does more to STOP abortion than any pro-life organization... by preventing unplanned pregnancy in the first place.  They also probably prevent some terminations and fetal deaths just by making prenatal care accessible, which can reduce birth defects, miscarriages, and stillbirths.
TwoXChromosomes X I just got my Mirena a month ago yesterday.  Insertion wasn't even that painful really, it just felt like really intense cramps....ok if i'm honest with myself, it was the worst cramps i've ever felt in my life, but from what i understand, you go through really painful cramps because of your endometriosis, so i think you'll actually do really well.  I'm currently dealing with a period that's last about 10 days now, but I don't think i'd do anything different if given the opportunity.
TwoXChromosomes X I was fine at the time of taking it but my next period was like the period from hell. Worst cramps, nausea, muscle aches, headaches, the worst. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm so sorry for your loss. :( Please don't blame yourself, as these things just happen sometimes. I highly doubt that anything you did (or didn't do) caused the miscarriage. And as someone who has suffered miscarriage before, let me tell you from personal experience, having a miscarriage (or even several) is no indication that she will not be able to carry a healthy pregnancy to term. *big hugs to you and your wife*
TwoXChromosomes X I've also heard many people complain of the stereotypical hormone-related side effects like mood swings, low libido, etc amplified on the Mirena
TwoXChromosomes X I have had recurrent miscarriages, I know where you are coming from. 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriages before the second trimester. 1 in 3 first time pregnancies miscarry. My most recent one, I was 11 W 4 D... diagnosed as a missed miscarriage. They did an ultrasound and found no babies, but two small placenta (twins).   These things happen for a reason, and as my doctor told me, there could have been something fundamentally wrong with the embryos when the first chromosome split. She could have a missed miscarriage. No-one did anything wrong. If anything, there could have been a fatal error in the development process of the fetus. Don't worry too much over it, even though it is a sad occurrence. you can always try again later, and it will not affect future pregnancies unless there is a fertility problem, which I very much doubt she has at this point. I suggest waiting 3 months before trying again. Good luck in your endeavors, and have fun trying again ;)
Parenting X But I really had my hopes up that it would be a boy, and now it's a girl... I've had disappointment after disappointment and I'm at the end of my rope...
TwoXChromosomes X Here is what my girlfriend has done for a yeast infection, and it's worked every time.  You don't need to put yogurt inside your vagina, but if it is yeast-related what you need to do is, one, stop eating anything with yeast in it for a few days:  this includes pizza, some breads (a lot don't have yeast, though, so check the labels), and most alcohol (especially beer).  Number two, you need to regain a balance of your good bacteria, so either eat yogurt or take the Accuflora supplements or anything else that will supplement the good bacteria in your body.  If this doesn't help in a few days, then it may not be a yeast infection and you should get checked out further to make sure it is not bacterial vaginosis or some other kind of irritation.
TwoXChromosomes X That makes sense. It really only comes into play during the heaviest discharge days...so maybe a couple days out of the month, if that. Most of the time I'm on the pill, and my periods are lighter. The flows can be pretty equal, so not sure if I secrete more than normal or just bleed less, lol. Either way I'll definitely ask about it next gyno appointment. Thanks for the info.
TwoXChromosomes X This is a good article about a great advancement in prenatal care.  I am so excited that advances in genetic testing are making it possible to detect diseases earlier on when an abortion is cheaper/easier/less invasive. 
TwoXChromosomes X Have you tried using xylocaine or numbing gel? It will stop any pain and still allow for pleasure. Your doctor can prescribe it.   It can make a huge difference. 
BabyBumps X Can someone explain to me what these feel like?  I think I've felt them, but not sure.  Is it just a rhythmic pulsing?  I sometimes feel that farther down on the belly than the kicks/jabs/butt.
BabyBumps X I've had two miscarriages - the first was probably a blighted ovum as the ultrasound showed an empty sac. The second made it to 7 weeks. I am now pregnant for the third time, but we have a heartbeat now - so this one will stick :)  Did you have any ultrasounds or appointments during the first two? 
Parenting X She refuses to bottle feed. We've been trying for weeks to get her to like the bottle with any number of different temperatures and rubber nipples but she knows the difference.  She eats roughly every 3 hours during the day.
Parenting X I have had an emergency c-section, 2 vbacs, and i will be having an elective section next week because of some complications from delivering a very large baby with my last pregnancy.  I live in Canada, my OB has already told me, if i am to become pregnant again and feel up to it, she would gladly give me another shot at a Vbac.  The issue isn't Vbacs its overuse of inducement, and the drugs that go along with them.  The stats on uterine rupture speak for themselves.   Crosspost this to /r/babybumps and a lot of women will have opinions on it i think.  This is a great unbiased article on Vbacs, uterine rupture, and the risks. 
BabyBumps X I'm sorry, but you will never stop worrying!!! First it's worry about a miscarriage, then it's the health of your baby, then is labor going to go smoothly.  I now have a 5 wk old and it's the fear of SIDS. I expect it to be something else in a few months :(.  Awesome. Your a mom :)
TwoXChromosomes X It took me a long time (it felt like years, but I don't get a period every month either) to figure it out as well. Keep trying :)  For getting it out, just use your birthing muscles to push as far as you can. Your finger will reach up that high and you can pop the seal.
TwoXChromosomes X I just switched about a week ago - already loving it! Beyond just remembering to take it, if I forgot and took two pills within 12 hours of each other, I would be stuck in bed, nauseous, unable to lay down because that made me feel like I had I throw up (also couldn't keep any food down for about 8 hours). Happened a few times over the years (when I was really tired or sick) and feel dumb for not switching the first time it happened!  
TwoXChromosomes X The epidural scared me more than labor, too, so I didn't get one. The only part of delivery that hurt was crowning, but I found out afterwards that my guy had a hand up by his face, so that was most of it. Contractions were a big feeling, but not a pain feeling for me. It felt like menstrual cramps in early labor (actually, less painful than my usual period cramps), and from transition until delivery just like I really had to take a massive poop. Actually, when I was admitted into labor and delivery (with the kid in the birth canal, minutes from delivery, because labor was easier than I expected it to be), I told the nurses I was fine and if they just gave me a minute to poop they could check me afterwards. They informed me that was the baby trying to come out. Yeah, I almost had him at home accidentally. If you expect childbirth to be painful it absolutely will be. If you go in with an open mind you might be surprised. I know it's easier said than done. I did hypnobirthing (not as cheesy as it sounds) and apparently it worked REALLY well.
BabyBumps X I went right out and bought four more tests of different types... Digital, plus sign kinds, written word result, and another line one of a different brand.  All positive!  Then I called my doctor and got in for a test the next week.  Positive again!
TwoXChromosomes X My cup migrates on it's own pretty frequently. I switched from a Diva Cup to a Lunette which is slightly wider and this is less of a problem. *Most* of the time my cup would migrate so that it was sitting around my cervix, which is where you want it to be. However, because my cervix sits to the far left, I find that knowing where it is and tilting it a little while I'm "stirring" my cup (running my finger along the outside of the cup to remove the "residual slobber" that inevitably builds up in the 2 minutes it takes to wash my cup) means that it migrates less. Migrating doesn't really hurt it, it just annoys me.   I didn't have a lot of problems when I first started using my cup, but swapping birth control changed my cervix a little bit, and I found that my Diva Cup was a little too finicky for me.  A slightly wider cup made ALL the difference.   I'mma shut up now, 'cause I'm a huge cloth pads/cup pusher, and I can babble on incessantly about them. I converted my 2 best female friends. 
TwoXChromosomes X My favorite- I find fucking bloody underwear and so I pull out the tampon expecting it to be saturated. NOPE- fucking shit just traveled down one small side to the goddamn string.  Rageface.jpg  I guess I'll just use pads even though I hate the feeling :(
BabyBumps X I honestly don't know too much about inductions, but from my understanding is the times it's "really bad" is more when your body and baby isn't ready at all. If your 3cm dilated, almost a week past due in my opinion you'll have a successful and easy labor &amp; delivery! 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't understand what the difference is, you are killing an inchoate being either way.  You're just killing it in an earlier stage of development.  It remains the same organism.  Imagine you have an abortion of a 4 month old in the womb.  What is the difference to that child if you wait until month 6 or month 9 to do it?  Either way it ceases to exist.  
TwoXChromosomes X That... makes no logical sense. It's easier and safer to care for the baby you've already carried to term than it is to kill that baby to support a fetus that may or may not even survive to term. Murder aside, keeping the living baby carries fewer risks. 
TwoXChromosomes X How long have you been on the birth control?  I am NOT a doctor, but typically if your body hasn't adjusted and you don't feel 'normal' after about three months/cycles of the pill, you should talk to your own doctor about trying a different pill.  Some people have to try a few before they get the one that works for them.
TwoXChromosomes X I second the peeing and cranberry pill recommendations. However, what ultimately made the difference for me (at least so far...!) was switching to glycerin-free lube. Maybe you don't use lube often, but if you ever do, avoid lubes with glycerin, which acts like sugar and feeds bacteria. Most silicone-based lubes are glycerin-free, or you can buy "natural" type water-based lubes.
TwoXChromosomes X In that case I do not think you should talk to your mother at this point. Right now you and the father (so glad he's involved!) are the decision makers. I'm glad the father will be there to support you so you don't have to go alone.   If you decide to get an abortion you don't necessarily ever have to tell your mother unless you want to. And if you feel like she'll be anything less than completely helpful and supportive then I recommend you don't tell her (at least for now).  Obviously if you decide to continue the pregnancy she's going to find out at some point, but it is completely your call when and what you want to tell her.   Seriously though, it's a scary and confusing time, but it really will be ok. *internet hugs*
TwoXChromosomes X So following your logic, anything that can't survive on its own isn't a living, breathing entity?  What about very premature babies?  A baby that's two months premature can't survive without being hooked up to dozens of life supporting systems, essentially just like being in the mother's womb, but it somehow has rights that an unborn baby 7 months along does?
TwoXChromosomes X Jesus, how long are his fingers?!    And yes, my ex did say something about the length of the strings.  She kept saying that she would go and get them "bent up" or "backwards" whatever the hell that means.  It did not work and I was upset.  Another question.  About the "strings."  Are they really strings?  because it felt more like hard  plastic or metal...
BabyBumps X Do you have an idea of how far along you actually are? 5 weeks is very early and it is certainly possible that a heartbeat or fetal pole just couldn't be seen due to the timing.
BabyBumps X Since they found the yolk sac, they know you are/were pregnant, that's why the opinion is that they think you have an intrauterine pregnancy, as opposed to a tubal or blighted ovum. They just haven't been able to see a fetal pole. As you say, you never know, just sit tight.  Sorry about the behavior of that tech. They really should just say nothing and act normal at the very least.  I would personally wonder about how long she'd been practicing to behave like that. To say, "are you sure you're pregnant" is ridiculous. And then obviously, there was a GS and it measured 5w, so she missed it initially--what else could she have missed? Of course that measurement could be off and you could be closer to 4. It seems so imprecise at times. 
BabyBumps X Yes, this is why we decided against it in my previous pregnancy and in this one as well. The number of false positives is very high and I worry and stress way too much. We'll have the 20 week anatomy scan and go from there.
TwoXChromosomes X According to the Mayo Clinic, "The effects of antibiotics on birth control pills may be overstated  except in the case of one antibiotic, rifampin (Rimactane). Studies clearly show that rifampin decreases the effectiveness of birth control pills in preventing ovulation. However, rifampin isn't used widely today."
TwoXChromosomes X Hmmm...I would personally say no, but I hate cramps. I don't mind bleeding for a few more days without cramps. Inconvenient, but not painful at least!
BabyBumps X I only have had blood tests and initial genetic screening so far. Everything came back normal, which was wonderful to hear. No CF for this baby!  I do want to have a nuchal translucency done because my husband and I are of the opinion that we'd rather be prepared and know just in case, rather than be hit hard on D-Day.
BabyBumps X We decided not to during the last pregnancy and also with this one.  I wouldn't be able to abort this far along under this circumstance and am not comfortable with confirmation amnio.  If my numbers weren't reassuring from the initial testing, it would just stress me for the duration of my pregnancy, and I'd rather just find out later.  Sure, there'd be a certain lack of preparedness for the worst, but for me, it was a saner decision to avoid the testing.
BabyBumps X I skipped all that and went straight for CVS.  I wanted a definitive yes/no answer ASAP.  Since I'm 38, the chances of chromosomal abnormalities are higher than the miscarriage rate from CVS and amnio.  I figured the farther along I was the harder it would be to make tough decisions should we get bad news.  And I'm not even talking about Down Syndrome.  They're looking for other, far more severe afflictions as well.
TwoXChromosomes X They really are. I HATE pads and only wear them overnight due to leakage, and these are the most comfortable.
BabyBumps X I just had my 2nd ultrasound yesterday and my sonographer saw the same thing - a couple  calcifications in the heart.  We saw the doctor afterwards and she explained that they would be concerned if it were one of a few soft predictors present for chromosomal abnormality, but since it was the only one they saw, the probability is very low.    I chose not to have 1st trimester genetic tests done because we had very shitty insurance at the time, and we were paying like $300 for basic blood and urine tests.  I also knew I wouldn't terminate, even if it came back positive, so I didn't go ahead with Amniocentesis or anything.    I am having another ultrasound in 8 weeks to re-check the heart, so I'm a little concerned, but not too worried.  Have an internet hug from me, we're in the same boat! (ps. We're having a girl, too!)
BabyBumps X My ob-gyn doesn't schedule for the first appointment until 10 weeks, and the date of my last period would have put me at 13 weeks, so they saw me when I turned out to only be 7 weeks. That seems pretty standard. You probably won't be able to see much at 4 weeks. 
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, there is a scientific definition of life.  And while there's debate there as well, most accepted definitions of life require the organism to be able to be grown independently of other organisms.  For example, you can grow bacteria on specific media that do not include other living cells.  Thus, they are living.  A living baby can grow without a living mother, so it is living.  A fetus cannot.  If you'd like to use an alternate definition of life, there's always sentience.  A fetus' brain doesn't develop much until [27 to 30 weeks of gestation, or around 7 months.]( )   Therefor, before that it's effectively brain dead, and since we can pull the plug on brain dead adults, why are fetuses any different?  They may make it to sentience, but there's no guarantee, and the earlier in the pregnancy, the less chance of actual life resulting anyway.  In fact, for a recognized pregnancy in the first trimester, [there's up to a 20% chance of miscarriage even without abortion.]( )  And since [most abortions occur well before either of these thresholds of life]( _Trends_Women_Obtaining_Abortions.pdf) (check the bottom of page 12), it's not usually a question of "Well, I got that abortion a day before viability.  That was close!"  I agree with you that it is difficult to pinpoint just when a fetus becomes alive, but with an ultrasound, a doctor can tell if a fetus is definitely not viable.  If there's a question of whether or not it's viable at a certain point, then the abortion should be illegal.  It's really that simple, and it's not unscientific or illogical.  Feel free to argue morality with me, but I assure you that I know how the scientific community defines life, since I work/study microbiology and biochemistry.  Furthermore, it's not as though pregnancy and childbirth are without risk.  In fact, they are higher risk than terminating the pregnancy.  So if you are so concerned with preserving potential lives, why is it ok to risk adult lives for children no one wants?  And while adoption is an option, the system isn't efficient enough to guarantee a home for every child, and even if it were, there aren't enough families for all the unwanted children you would force women to have.  That doesn't even include the emotional toll of giving up a baby, which [appears to be equal to the emotional toll of abortion]( ), but there don't seem to have been many studies and a quick Google search reveals few resources for birth mothers. 
BabyBumps X We found out I was pregnant by chance via labs while I was being prepped for sinus surgery! Blood work indicated we were about 5 weeks (and surgery was obviously cancelled. ;) ). At 6 week, I had the most severe cramping ever (no bleeding), but decided to be checked out at the ER anyway (it was the middle of the night). It took a trans-vaginal US, but they were able to find the yoke sac but and much else. Length was estimated at 6 weeks, 3 days. I was put on bed rest (for lack of anything else to do) for 3 weeks. We had another US at 9 weeks to confirm we still had a viable pregnancy/gestation. I didn't see the fetal pole until then. Aside from normal pregnancy woes, everything has been fine since. Best wishes! Let us know what you hear!!! 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not out to question every statement you make, so there is no need for your citations. Your argument is similar to mine, and doesn't really depend on knowing the gestation periods or statistics of abortion.   Now, I'll abide by it, but I don't like the viability argument because A.) thats a technological limitation and doesn't speak to the act of abortion itself, and B.) as I've stated viability in a hostile environment is a terrible metric. I can't base your personhood on how viable you'd be if I submerged you in water for 30 seconds, or if I removed your intestines, or if I ripped the umbilical cord out of a fetus. This kills the fetus. We know this is a scientific fact. I would support 100% the abortion of a fetus if it isn't viable inside the uterus. But that's not the argument at hand.   So, the inability to receive external nourishment is my criteria for abortion (be it through machine or another uterus). As soon as humans develop conception day pseudo-uterus environments I'll support making abortion illegal. The choice aspect would become irrelevant. You don't want to carry to term, fine. Similar procedure, but instead of the trash it's implanted elsewhere. No financial responsibility, no nothing. It's as if you've aborted the fetus.   As for the reason behind that line, it is because if the mother dies, the fetus is dead as well. That's it, they are inseparable. Now, if the mother can die and the fetus live it doesn't make sense for the mother to abort it. It doesn't need her to live, just get it taken out and placed elsewhere. In that case it is impermissible to condone abortion.
BabyBumps X My first doctor wouldn't even see me until 12 weeks (at which point he started accusing me of lying about how far along I was because I "couldn't possibly be more than 6 weeks" ... turned out I had had a missed miscarriage we found over the next 2 weeks and ultrasounds... VERY unprofessional)  My favorite doctor I would go in, pee on a stick, then they would schedule my entire pregnancy worth of appointments starting at 8 weeks.  My midwife does her first appointment at 8 weeks.  There's really not much to be done before then, take prenatals, do what you can for any morning sickness you get (though it tends to get worse around 8 weeks when the placenta starts to kick in)
BabyBumps X From what I've read and been told (and have been experiencing myself), it's completely normal for most or all of the symptoms to diminish when entering the second trimester. Just try to remember that now that you are past the 12 week mark (and I assume you have been able to hear the heartbeat by now) the chances of a m/c are down to like 1 or 2% (I can't remember which). Hope this info helps you feel better!
BabyBumps X I felt the same way, although I had not previously had a miscarriage.  But as soon as I started feeling the baby move, it became a lot more "real" and I started to feel more and more pregnant.  Just relax and know that you're doing everything you can for your baby!  You'll be great!
Parenting X Rarely are there complications that happen that have no risk factors, and the ones that do happen there are already emergency plans for this.   I doubt crazyex had her children at home alone (unless by accident), and any midwife worth her while would have the appropriate equipment and medicine to cover any issue that comes up at least long enough to transfer the laboring mother and/or mother and child to the hospital.  The biggest argument people like you give against homebirth is how risky it is in the case of a hemorrhage which is not an argument at all, they do the same thing at home (a shot of oxytocin or similar drug) as what they would do at the hospital.   It is shockingly easy to "risk out" of a homebirth and not have any midwife even want to consider doing it. [In a healthy woman with no history of complications, ]( -7/377) it is very possibly SAFER to do a homebirth than a hospital birth, due to the lower rate of unnecessary interventions or risk of infections (yes, seriously, your risk of infection is lower at home than in a place full of sick people.)
BabyBumps X My doctor wouldn't even see me until 8 weeks, and no ultrasound until 12, if your only 5 weeks 3 days it is VERY early to see just about anything. Good Luck
Parenting X People will give you crap for it as long as they know. The hospital was across the street if something went wrong. Talk to your midwives about what they do in emergency situations. Also- I went home about 5hours after birth. It was nice :)
Parenting X It wasn't for NOTHING.  You gave it your very best effort, and you can be sure in your knowledge that you tried your best.  Acceptance will come, though I understand your disappointment.  I wanted a med-free birth myself, but with a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and the pit turned up to 30, I got the epidural.  It took me a while to by fully ok with it, but what helped is knowing that for me, the epi prevented a c-section.  It wasn't ideal, but it wasn't so bad either.  You'll get there.  I *know* how people in the natural birth communities can be about c-sections, and you *will* encounter someone who implies you had an "unnecessarean".  That's your cue that you're likely talking to a douche.  I too was embarrassed about "caving", but over time I was able to see the good in it.  You don't even have to worry about that.  If you had an emergency section, you likely truly did need it.  I'm a little surprised they didn't tell you what, if anything, they found.  Sometimes babies are malpositioned (like their head is stuck in an angle that is *never* going to fix itself), sometimes the cord is too short, so baby can't descend and put the necessary pressure on your cervix.  Take heart in the fact that your body DID do what it was supposed to do.  When babies don't come out vaginally after all that effort, there's usually a damn good reason.  You saved your baby's life, and quite possibly your own.  There is NO shame in that.    Like I said, you'll get there.  It's perfectly alright to feel disappointed that you didn't get the birth experience you want, and it does not mean you aren't grateful you have a healthy baby.  Feelings are feelings, and it's better to not repress them.  Take your time processing the experience you did have, and you'll come to be able to accept it.
BabyBumps X I went 5 months before knowing I was pregnant, and the whole thing was symptom-less, i didn't even get a big belly, just looked kinda fat.
TwoXChromosomes X I have horrendous nausea and those inner thigh cramps right before my period. It's just your hormones wreaking havoc.   I can't say I've ever had chest pains though. Could it be indigestion or gas causing the pains? I've had both of those right before my period also :\
BabyBumps X The first time I felt baby, at 19wks, it felt like a goldfish fluttering in my lower abdomen.  I was bummed because I didn't feel baby again until 20/21wks when I suddenly realized that the gas-like feeling over the past week wasn't gas...it was baby!
TwoXChromosomes X It is okay to have an abortion and grieve for your loss. *It is okay*. If you decide that you want to have an abortion then it is okay to feel sorrow, and it is okay to think "I really want a baby - I'm going to have one soon... just not right now." I don't think you are going to regret it for the rest of your life because in all likely hood this won't be the only time you become pregnant. You can choose to have a child later.
TwoXChromosomes X I could be completely off-base, but by how you sound in your original post and your replies...it seems like you really want this baby. I think with those feelings, it would be very difficult to recover from an abortion. That being said, you should definitely consider what's best for you and the baby.  My personal opinion? I would probably keep the baby if I were in your shoes. I just know I could not stomach the idea of abortion. That's not to say getting an abortion is wrong; it's not, it's completely your choice and understandable in your position.  You have a lot to consider, but realize in the end, it will be okay. Please make an update post when you make a decision!
AskWomen X Don't groom yourself differently from normal. They're evaluating your health as you normally are and altering things for them won't help. If you're feeling uncomfortable, let them know it's your first time and that you're nervous (I had my first obgyn visit with a male doctor a couple months ago and he was really nice about me not quite being comfortable with a male doctor there and took a few extra minutes to talk to me first so I'd be more comfortable and offered to get female nurses to come in if I was uncomfortable and such).     Definitely the drinking water, but ask if they want a urine sample and get that done before your pelvic exam because the part where they stick a couple fingers up your vagina and push on your tummy with the other hand to feel your ovaries is uncomfortable in its own and excruciating when you have a full bladder (learned that the hard way). 
TwoXChromosomes X It's not your period.  It's implantation bleeding, as well as hormone fluctuation continuing to try and shed blood and tissue.  It's technically, by definition, not a period because the egg is not being shed. 
TwoXChromosomes X You should be able to get plain yogurt without much sugar, if any. But a better thing to do is get acidophilus capsules and open them up, make it into a paste and apply that. But you will feel itchy and burny for probably one more day anyway. 
Parenting X I had to be induced with my oldest daughter. It wasn't fun, 14 hours on pitocin to get dilated to a 1 1/2. =(  Luckily they decided at that point to break my water and I had her less than 2 hours later. So I guess my advice is- Have them break your water as soon as possible.  Don't forget your chapstick and extra socks.   And something no one told me about pushing- It is going to feel like you have to poop and that is how you push, like you are taking the biggest poop of your life. If I had known that, I would have been pushing a whole lot more effectively much sooner. Good luck, and don't feel bad if you need drugs for the pain, pitocin makes labor much more painful than normal labor. 
Parenting X 1.  Induction (here in Australia anyway) is a two stage process:  the first medication to dilate - I think - then the second one to start contractions.  However you may go naturally into contractions before you need the second medication.  2.  As you are aware contractions will probably be painful, and it's usually worse for a first.  It's great that you plan to get an epidural.  I've yet to meet anyone who didn't find it the most wonderful thing in the world!  But *nag* the doctors/midwives/nurses, in case everything does suddenly progress too quickly and it's too late to get one.  So if they check and you're not yet dilated enough, have them check again *soon*, don't wait too long, as things can suddenly speed up.  3.  If you can't get an epidural but they give you gas and air - *suck the living shit out of it*.  It is great stuff.  It seems kind of scary at first, but just go for it.  4.  You may find the pushing stage is "easier" than the contractions because it's actually less painful.  So if the contractions are the most awful thing you can imagine, you may find things start to get better not worse.  5.  If you have to have a caesarian section, it is really just one tiny thing in the huge, vast, rich experience of parenting.  I know a lot of people get really upset about it - there's another thread in here with just that - but it's *nothing* in the grand scheme of things.  Your health and your baby's health are all that matter.  You have already succeeded just to have got this far.  There are no prizes or medals handed out after labour and childbirth.  However it happens, just focus on the sheer joy of seeing your baby at last.   
Parenting X You honestly believe that a woman who goes into the hospital for no other reason than she's been in labor for 25 hours, even though she shows no sign of infection or fetal distress, will just be shipped off immediately for a c-section just so the doctor can go home?
BabyBumps X ^ this. Delay the cord clamping to get the best benefits for your baby's future.
TwoXChromosomes X Dear Drippyredstockings,  Give it a go, but I never had any leaking problems with ob tampons. I tried to make the Diva cup work for about 6 months, and it always leaked. And a leaking cup isn't like a leaking tampon. You don't get a fine red mist, you get a torrential downpour. On one particularly memorable occasion I was at a microscope and felt a gushing. I carefully, squishilly waddled to the bathroom where I took down my pants and witnessed what had occured. It was like I wet my pants, but with blood. And yes, it went through the pants. I had to go home from work because I didn't have a change of clothes.   -Bloodwetter
Parenting X While it is true that in this case, OPs induction has been deemed medically necessary, it is not true that "no one chooses an induction". People certainly choose inductions, and c-sections, for reasons of convenience rather than necessity. In the OB practice I went to, docs routinely scheduled inductions for 41 weeks just because the mom was "past-due". 
Parenting X As a non-parent, i'd say, don't do it. The hygienic issues only come with neglected hygiene anyway. Also, the foreskin has loads of nerve ends, and you'd numb his penis by cutting it off.   He can decide to get a circumcision anyway when he's older. "But he won't do it then!" So why should you do it now?
TwoXChromosomes X The occasional missed period is not all that uncommon on most forms of birthcontrol. I've missed one or two breakthrough bleeds (been on Microgynon 30 for nearly 5 years) the first time it happened my doctor told me not to worry but to come back if it happened the next month.   It's only a problem if it begins to happen with great frequency. Also changing your diet/huge increase in exercise and other lifestyle changes can have an impact on your cycles whether you're on the pill or not.
Parenting X Having a healthy baby IS the important thing. In fact it's the only thing, nothing else matters.  What is so wrong with letting modern medicine do its thing? Try again on your next baby, not every pregnancy goes smoothly...in fact it used to kill a hell of a lot of women before science began to really help things out and put an end to that.  You've got a beautiful little girl now, a lot of women out there can't have children at all, let alone a birth plan.
Parenting X nope. I've got 2 boys, both uncircumcised. everyone talks about the "medical reasons" to have them circumcised, I have NEVER had an issue with my boys being uncircumcised. they wouldn't be born that way if it was healthier otherwise. 
Parenting X I disagree in that I find it informative as a person who is planning to have a natural birth at a birthing center. I think some women who feel bitter about having the medication had the wrong expectations about birth.  I hope I get natural, but If i have to go to the hospital, well then, off to the hospital I go.
Parenting X The onion said it : "Natural child birth, how moraly superior it makes you feel".  Seriously, who gives a damn about this hippy bullshit. We have the technology and science to manage birth more safely and efficiently.  Nature is not beautiful. Nature is cold and cruel. We shouldn't try to romanticize the good old days, there is nothing romantic about a mother and baby dying during labor, something that was FAR too prevalent in the good old days.  Healthy mum? Healthy baby? Consider yourself LUCKY and shut up about it already. Can you say 1st world problem?
BabyBumps X Good point. Just to clarify, the blue dye tests tend to give false positives because of an evaporation line. If you get a faint positive with a blue dye test, try again with first morning urine (so the line will be darker), or try again with a pink dye test, or go to the doctor for a blood test. A dark positive line on a blue dye test is very rarely a false positive.
TwoXChromosomes X I actually like the always packaging on my pads (I tend to use the heavier pads because I'm paranoid about leaks so I've got the orange package with stars on it). Of course, I'm now switching away from Always because of what someone on TwoX said about chemicals used on the pads.
TwoXChromosomes X Why not do it in public with a blanket or something just covering the breast? I've seen plenty of women do this, so I know it wouldn't harm/suffocate the baby. Edit - Read below and realized some babies won't tolerate a cover. Okay, I do understand that. 
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with you - it's his penis, it's his choice.  It seems that your wife may have concerns about the aesthetics of an uncircumcised penis, but frankly - that's not for her to decide. If she is worried about cleanliness, then make it a point to teach your son about making sure he cleans himself properly. If she's worried about having to take extra care of the foreskin when he is a baby - well, I'm sorry, can you say *selfish?*  Lastly - it would be easier for him to get a circumcision when he is older if he wants than it would be for him to undergo some form of [Foreskin Restoration]( _restoration) procedure.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, (maybe?) you can ask her what she'd think if you were having a girl and you really wanted to have her labia cut for no reason other than tradition or that it was perceived as aesthetically pleasing.   I don't know if that will help.  Talking to a doctor may help though. This is also from the American Academy of Pediatrics: "Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."
TwoXChromosomes X agreed you should be using condoms, and if it's unprotected you're doing it wrong. yet still, HIV and other STDs are rampant EVERYWHERE, and not just Africa. HIV is in epidemic proportions in parts of the US (that's not an exaggeration, that is fact).   
TwoXChromosomes X Oh man, my boyfriend and I fought endlessly about this. He supports circumcision, and I am against traumatizing my baby with pain, and putting him at risk for DEATH (yes, babies can die from complications - it's a fucking surgery, risk of infection, a very painful fucking death for your beloved infant) just for "cosmetics" and because "girls in this country like it more." Nope, I like my babies alive. Foreskins exist for a reason. If you do the research, you will see that there is not much science out there supporting the supposed "health benefits" of circumcision. The argument that it's more clean is bullshit. Teach your fucking sons how to bathe.  I can cut my arms off and ensure that I'll never have dirty arms, or I could not be not dead from surgery complications and be able to bathe myself.    It's a big enough issue for me that I'd refuse to marry someone over it. Why? Because I'm not going to put my baby through unnecessary surgery that may risk his life. I can't comprehend why anyone would think anything is worth risking their child's life for - especially not over   aesthetics, or worse, outdated/false scientific beliefs that have been disprove by more recent studies.    Vanity and laziness is no excuse to endanger your child's life.   Show her a video of circumcision where they strap the baby down before cutting into its genitals. Have her speak to adult men who have made the decision to be circumcised in adulthood, and have her ask about the pain they endure for weeks after the surgery. You want that for your baby? , in most other countries besides America, uncircumcised is the norm... You know, because that's what the normal human body is supposed to fucking be like. That's why I wouldn't worry so much about the aesthetics. Men in other countries where norm (uncirc) is the... norm seem to be getting along fine, in terms of health and women. Personally I prefer unmutiliated dicks. (Foreskins are hot. Circumcised boys are just missing something they can never get back - additional sensitivity, extra protection for the head, etc).  If my son is going to date a person who will treat him like shit over something out of his control, like how much his mother valued his life/how scientifically uninformed his parents were, well, I'd rather his foreskin repel them anyway. I don't want my son putting up with someone like that. 
BabyBumps X blue dye tests, in my experience work fine... i think a lot of false positives are attributed to checking the test after the 2 or 5 minute marker or whatever.  the dye is more susceptible to bleed and will often show an evaporation line that looks like a faint positive.  this has happened to me, when i was not pregnant... 
Parenting X There are many possible complications to having a foreskin and they have nothing to do with Hygiene.  Having a foreskin can sometimes prevent you from having any sexual pleasure at all.
Parenting X Oh dear, I feel for you very strongly. I am lucky in that I had my home birth, but it is just that--lucky. You went 25 hours in labor when most women don't even consider going natural for any length of time. You are so strong and did what was best for your baby. I understand feeling let down by your body. My son was 8 days late and everyone had me convinced that I was going to wind up with an inducement, which was not what I wanted. The whole time I was waiting for him to arrive I felt like I was broken somehow.  Birth plans are so very impossible, as your body and baby are going to do what they do no matter what you have in mind. You are an admirable woman for hanging in there the way you did, and then being flexible in your thinking and keeping your baby safe. Those other women were wrong. You had the strength, it just didn't work that way. 
Parenting X I'm so sorry about what happened to you. It's absolutely awful and no one should go through that.  It sounds like you were a victim of [forced foreskin retraction]( -forcedretraction.html). At birth, the foreskin is supposed to be fused to the glans, and sometimes it does not separate until after puberty. When you went to see the doctor at 4 years old, and your foreskin was stuck, that's because it was supposed to be stuck. Your doctor should have known that, but in ignorance, he forcibly retracted you. It's extremely painful, and it can cause permanent damage because of the resulting scar tissue.   Your problems are not due to being uncircumcised, but because your doctor broke the first rule of medicine: do no harm. If I were you, I would look into suing him for malpractice.
TwoXChromosomes X Clitoris is analgous to a penis. A foreskin is analgous to a clitoral hood. 
BabyBumps X It took me until about week eight or so to "feel pregnant" at all, instead of just sick. Now I think I'm starting to show, plus my breasts have gone a bit crazy, so I feel much more "really pregnant" now.
TwoXChromosomes X 1-talk to a doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 2- do you mean taking an 8 day break after a pack, rather than 7?The guide usually says that longer than 7 days might leave you unprotected. Probably better to take a 1 day break after your next pack.
TwoXChromosomes X The first pills in your pack are the most important for preventing pregnancy. Generally you need to take 7 consecutive days worth of pills/patch/ring/whatever to stop ovulation. If you do chose to start this pack on Monday instead, use condoms/abstain for 7 days. This is essentially like starting over or using the "quick start" method. 
BabyBumps X I felt my first flutters at 16 weeks, SO felt the first kicks at 21 weeks.  It's early but not unheard of, I don't think.  If she's kicking this hard now, the next 17 weeks may be rough!  Wishing you, your bladder and ribs luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Have you considered an IUD?  A lot of women I know have found that hormonal birth control messes with their moods and libido. IUD has no down side, can be non-hormonal, is really effective, and you don't have to take a pill everyday. 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, I read the narrative, and she discusses the origins of adoption as something that happens after children are orphaned (and that it made some sense in that context). I can see how someone would look around at what is happening with adoption *today*, and see that that's pretty much a corner case anymore, and come to the conclusion that they need to be against all of it.  Just as I can see how someone would come to the conclusion that they'd need to be against ALL abortion, even in cases of rape or severe danger to the mother. I disagree (strongly), but I can see that someone else might come to a different conclusion.
TwoXChromosome X _intercourse_101  1. My first try didn't go well. We couldn't get the penis in. When I saw a doctor about it, I found out the muscles in my pelvic floor (and surrounding area) were too tight, so I had to go through pelvic floor physiotherapy. Now I can have intercourse (using specific techniques) and it doesn't hurt :)  2. It felt mentally good the first time we completed intercourse (after we had fixed the sexual pain problem), and he finished me off with two fingers inserted for the first time, which felt amazing! The penis felt physically good inside me the third time. We find that cowgirl (girl on top) is the most comfortable position for me.  Remember the good sex acronym, FRACTAL (that bgugi and I created): Foreplay, Relaxation, Arousal, Comfort, Talk And Lubrication.  Once I had my physical problem under control, intercourse was not sore and did not leave me sore afterwards either. I communicate with my husband to let him know exactly what I need, and we are very gentle in our lovemaking while my muscles are still adapting to intercourse.
BabyBumps X I spotted at 6 weeks too. It was very light, brownish in colour and was almost like dried blood suspended in what has become the standard pregnancy discharge.   I called my doctor right away and was told that it was normal, and as long as it wasn't accompanied by heavy cramps, pain and the bleeding didn't increase it was fine.   My spotting lasted for about 3 days, and then cleared up. I also had what felt like low grade period cramps, sort of achey, mostly annoying, not really painful from the 5 to the 6th week. The standard advice rings true, if you're concerned, make the call, it can help put your mind at ease.   It's really easy to become terrified at every little twinge and spot, I know I do and I am not that much far ahead of you in my pregnancy. Try not to get caught up in all the doomsday advice that will tell you that a miscarriage is imminent, I found that there is always going to be someone that is going to tell you the worst possible thing - don't know why they decide that telling a newly pregnant woman that a perfectly normal symptom is a doomsday device, but they do.   I had a doctor tell me that my fatigue in the 7th week must be my thyroid, not you know, because I was working hard all the time growing a brand new human being. The nurse actually laughed at him and said, "or you know, she's pregnant."  Take it easy, keep an eye on it. Get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Congratulations on your pregnancy!
BabyBumps X I also spotted at 6 weeks - bright red blood, but mostly only when I peed.  Nothing on my undies.  After about 4 or 5 days, it stopped, and I had an appointment with my midwife and an ultrasound a few days after that.  They told me it was probably implantation bleeding, and it's totally normal.  The little fella is still going strong, kicking the crap out of my stomach as we speak!  Like everyone else has said, check in with your care provider to be sure and ease your worries.  Heavy flow and bad cramping is a worry, but as long as you don't have any of that, you are most likely fine. 
BabyBumps X You'll feel MUCH less trapped at home once baby is here and you can go out (even if you were breastfeeding, you can go out and take baby with you, but whatever, that's your choice)   I had to spend 5 months on bedrest with my son, it drove me crazy, I'm sorry you are dealing with that.
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on the pill. They should all have an informational insert that you should read--mine said I only had to wait a week. 
BabyBumps X I planned to breastfeed my son and then when he was born, it just didn't work out. He couldn't latch on and then when I pumped and froze it, I couldn't produce enough. I tried for a month and (regretfully and with many tears) gave up. I knew nothing about formula but HAD to use it. I am pregnant now and plan to breastfeed until I have to go back to work. But I also know to NOT plan for much of anything when it comes to a baby now. 
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks- I need to look into a thermometer and start keeping track of that. With an irregular cycle, maybe my ovulation is later than I think!
TwoXChromosomes X Hope it's okay for me to chime in - the birth control that gives you periods every three months is Seasonique, I think, and there are a couple generic forms. I don't know how true this is, but when I talked to my doctor about it, he said the only difference between Seasonique and 'regular' pills is in the packaging, and if you're taking regular birth control just skip the period week of pills and start the new pack straightaway. I've skipped periods like this before and the next one does tend to be a little heavier, plus it seems like I break out a little (doctor said something about how suppressing menstruation can do that due to ~hormone buildup~?), but no real ill effects.
Parenting X Does she always drink from a bottle or does she sometime breastfeed sometimes bottle? Perhaps the nipple on the bottle is a faster flow than the breast.  Try a slower flow nipple on the bottle or even a different type of bottle (we went through 3 or 4 different kinds of bottles and nipples before we found one that worked).  Also try sitting her up a bit more so she's having to suck the milk back rather than it just running down her throat.  Reflux is usually accompanied by vomiting or excessive spitting up.
BabyBumps X My OB office does not let twin pregnancies go past 38 weeks. I'm scheduled for my C-Section (they also prefer it for safety reasons, but let you pick as long as babies are in proper position) in about 2.5 mos. It is the day they will be planning a c-section, but will induce me for delivery if the babies (twin A is vertex and twin B is vertex or breech). I'm scared about both - I want to experience the whole birthing process, but scared of the pain and risk of babies and me with v-birth. However, with c-section there are risks too, as it's a major surgery. I just don't want to deal with the incisional pain while I'm trying to take care of my babies and possible infection and ileus. Sigh. Such a tough call. :/
TwoXChromosomes X I personally am of the belief that even though doctors tell me that I don't actually *need* one, my period is probably there for a reason. Even if it is just breakthrough birth control bleeding, I tend to use it as a time to spoil myself and relax a little more than I normally would.
TwoXChromosomes X Make sure you're getting enough sleep. That's when your skin repairs itself. Also, I know this sounds silly but eats lots of garlic. I read once that garlic helps with swelling and irritation and it's true! I eat a fair amount of garlic and it keeps the redness down. 
BabyBumps X This isn't the case for everyone. It depends on each mom and a lot to do with what pump they have. I can pump 4-5 oz easy in 20 minutes.
TwoXChromosomes X I think everything's right except that vaginas are naturally acidic, not basic. [Source]( -wet-mount) and [source]( _vaginosis).
BabyBumps X I'm the opposite.  I'm hoping for a vaginal delivery of both, while understanding a c-section may be necessary.  It all depends on the positioning of the babies at the time of delivery, as I understand it.  I'd personally rather avoid having to recover from the major surgery while caring for two babies, though.    A happy and healthy pregnancy and delivery to you! :)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I don't know if I can do this. Part of me knows that keeping the baby is what Ted would have wanted and that I will love it no matter what, but I know the truth. Everyday our baby will remind me of him, and I don't know if I can handle this. In a million years I couldn't have imagined a scenario where I would even consider having an abortion, but I never expected this.  It's honorable you are thinking about what Ted wanted but you need to think of the baby.  Will you be able to give it a good life as a single parent?  Will you have the support of the families financially and emotionally?  Considering abortion is responsible.
BabyBumps X I desperately wanted a girl. I chose to find out because if it had been a boy, I probably would have been a little bummed, to be honest. I'd have loved a boy just as much, but it would have taken some time to get used to since I had a strong gut feeling it was a girl. 
TwoXChromosomes X It is ok. God, I remember going to my gyno a while ago and saying "I am not really getting my period and I am scared". She looked at me and laughed, said "do you want to take a birth control that will make your period heavier? or do you want to stick with something that is OK!" Yea... don't worry about it unless you have been careless about your pills and have been having LOADS of unprotected sex.
BabyBumps X You are most definitely not alone.  What helped me early on was doing some reading and understanding a little more what was happening with the little bean inside me, and with my body.  The birth stories in Ina May's Guide to Childbirth really helped to calm me down initially.  As others have said, it probably won't feel like it's going fast the entire time.  You've got almost 8 months ahead of you to adjust to being pregnant, prepare for what is to come, and bond with the little bean inside you.  Writing/journaling helps me get out my (sometimes crazy) feelings and process it all.  Take a deep breath, and take it one day at a time.  Good luck, momma!
TwoXChromosomes X But why is it that you could imagine forcing an in-law to go through 9 months of potential hell, irrevocably alter her body, and be saddled with the emotional baggage that comes with motherhood? If she has it and raises it, that severely determines the course of her life. If she has it and you raise it, she still knows it's there, and has to deal with either an inadequate, half relationship, or not be a part of it's life and have the probable guilt that comes along with abandoning a child to someone else, and knowing that that child will have to wonder why "mommy didn't want me." The grandparents raising it when *one parent is still alive* is not as easy an answer as you make it seem to be.
BabyBumps X I don't think you can *hear* the heartbeat that early.  You can definitely see it on the ultrasound, but I'm not sure a doppler can pick it up.  Because I went through fertility treatment, I got to see the baby (&amp; heartbeat) at 7wks, but I didn't get to *hear* it until much later (12wks?).  I'm curious if you have a different experience, please report back!
TwoXChromosomes X I dislike the vag-fro for the period factor. The hair actually retains smell, even after washing. I find that when it's shorter or non existent, it's easier to wipe. Mostly because the first day or so of my period is like a waterfall and I wear a pad. Yuck :(
TwoXChromosomes X Next time try yogurt, directly applied, as a preventative or as a treatment. Freeze some in the fingers of a latex glove and insert. It's messy, but works! Using Diflucan many times can results in a new breed of resistant yeast. It's becoming an issue in health care, like antibiotic resistant bacteria.
TwoXChromosomes X Not really. We're talking about preparations one can do to make anal sex more enjoyable.  This is all done with the assumption that you're with a partner who wants to do anal sex. Someone who doesnt like the feeling they probably do not fall under this category.  There should also not be any bleeding.  If you are, you most likely have a small tear somewhere from not enough lube or being too rough.
BabyBumps X I have [SPD]( _pubis_dysfunction) so getting out of bed at night is excruciatingly painful, and now I have to wake up every two hours to go pee. Having a baby who wants to be up all night is gonna be nothing compared to this, as long as after I have him the severe hip and pelvic pain goes away.
Parenting X We're taking a "Whatever it takes to make baby healthy" route. Wife works at the NICU and has seen what can happen when you refuse medical treatment. She's breastfeeding, but pumping and using bottles if needed, and we've supplemented with formula twice but are trying to stay with breastfeeding if at all possible. I'm all for natural, but only as long as baby doesn't suffer for it.
Parenting X &gt;after the baby is 'born' (c-section)  No need to put born in quotes.  She won't be any less born than a baby delivered vaginally. 
BabyBumps X I lost and regrew my mucus plug at about 27 weeks, so it may or may not mean anything. Just keep track of your contractions and let your doctor know if they increase in length and intensity and if they get closer together and more regular. Good luck! How many weeks are you?
BabyBumps X Were you on a mini-pill or a regular one?  I imagine if you were on a regular pill with a placebo week it could trick your body into having a period it wouldn't otherwise have, but those aren't usually prescribed to breastfeeding women because they can be bad for milk supply.  Yeah, it doesn't happen to everyone, but according to kellymom around 40% of women totally lose their supply due to the pregnancy hormones.  I just assumed I would be part of the other 60%, but I was wrong!  
TwoXChromosomes X For some people, their normal is "irregular" ... some people just have irregular periods. Brown blood is "old" blood. For me it tends to come near the end of the week. Some weeks I get cramps, some weeks I don't.  Just random thoughts to add I guess. It's helped me a lot to keep a calendar of these things. Not just when my period is but how heavy it is and other mood/soreness/etc/ things that might be valid. I'm on BC though so my period is regular to the day.
BabyBumps X the less medicated you are to greater your ability to move about. My OB has agreed to start a hep lock/pic (not sure what the correct term in) but not to hook me to an IV. I will be mainting my own hydration so that I can walk around and change positions as I need to. The IV port (?- sorry not medical) will already be in place incase they need to push fluids or drugs in the event that something is not going right. There are options. 
TwoXChromosomes X I would talk to a Dr. if it keeps going for more than 2 weeks. It probably just means you arent on the right pill, they may need to adjust the dosage or try another brand. No matter what pill I was on, I had breakthrough bleeding in the 2nd or 3rd month that wouldnt stop and ended up with the patch, which has worked great.  It is something to check up on, but you shouldn't worry about something being horribly wrong. 
BabyBumps X At 39 weeks, my OB said I might go past my due date. I delivered two days later.  I was dilated 1cm for weeks. I had complained of gas pains (which I really thought it was -because my husband was feeling gassy too).  I later realized those gas pains were labor.  I would not travel. Wishing you a healthy delivery.
BabyBumps X whoa!  very cool.  i feel something like this too.  never thought of it being that.  i also feel like i'm carrying an octopus and not a baby.  i swear at any given time there are limbs pushing my insides, kicking and such from every direction.  i can even see it sometimes.  from both ends there will be movement (top and bottom or side to side or top and side).  i call it the one / two punch or kick when she does it.  she also does a weird (but crazy awesome feeling) slide movement.  i love how active my baby is already!  i do hope this doesn't mean i'll have a baby that never naps though.  EEK!
BabyBumps X I had really, really bad hip pain throughout my second trimester. I couldn't walk without limping in excruciating pain. I told my midwife, and she suggested I see a chiropractor. I went to one here in town and didn't really expect much, but after three visits, the pain was (and still is) completely gone.  He mostly just massaged my hips hard and focused on the pressure points. I was a little stiff afterward, but I found the pain just gradually went away. 
BabyBumps X I could not imagine pushing for six hours. I was insanely lucky.  I did get nice and torn up. I only labored 17 hours and I didn't get pitocin until after the baby was out.  I often think of how much I loved my baby to have labored like I did. You are an amazing mom!!!
BabyBumps X I am 20 weeks pregnant and I haven't really felt *any* movement.  I have only had flutters here and there.  My placenta is in front of my uterus (I think I have that right) and apparently I'm not supposed to be able feel much.  I keep reading posts about kicks and jabs with a little jealousy.  =P
TwoXChromosomes X I'm so sorry that you're having to deal with all of this right now. This is a hard enough time without you having to put up with people doing this to you.  That said, they have absolutely no right to tell you have to live your life, nor whether or not you choose to keep your child. You can abort or have the baby or put the baby up for adoption, but whatever you choose, it's your choice, not theirs. There is absolutely no legal way for them to force you to live with them or for them to tell you whether or not you can have an abortion.  Whatever choice you end up making, please don't let it be influenced by them. It's your life, not theirs. You've gone through enough.
TwoXChromosomes X I am on the pill too. What do you mean by "late?" My period usually comes about 2 days into the placebo pills. Maybe you need pills with stronger hormones.
TwoXChromosomes X Your description is too vague to accurately answer your question.  First of all, almost all BC pills have placebo pills, so that doesn't narrow it down. What brand are you on?  Second, what do you mean by "both early and late"? Does "early" mean sometimes you start bleeding before you get to your placebo pills? Does "late" mean you don't start bleeding until partway through your placebo pills or after you've finished your placebo pills?   Third, how long have you been on this pill? 
TwoXChromosomes X Its the official Planned parenthood website but its a sub page that talks specifically about my local office. Do you think they can still help, even though health services aren't provided? -center/centerDetails.asp?f=3604&amp;a=90880&amp;v=details
TwoXChromosomes X When did you start taking the pills in relation to your ovulation cycle?  I experienced something similar (although my cramping wasn't too horrendous) when I first started the pill.    If you don't start basically right after your last period, you jumble everything up.    I would definitely recommend you see a doctor.  HOWEVER, if it were my body, I would continue taking the pill and just keep an eye on things for another cycle.  But then, I am irresponsible.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Blood clots can kill you.   Blood clots in your veins that travel to your brain, heart, or lungs can kill you.    Most period blood clots are completely normal and harmless.  It is NOT the same kind of blood clot, even though it is bloody and clotty. When you change birth control the hormones that regulate the thickness of the uterine lining can get a little funky, leading to larger than normal clots.   This does not mean that you shouldn't get it checked out, it just means that "blood clot" and "clot of period blood" are not the same thing.
BabyBumps X ipermalinkreportreplyyeah couldn't express a single drop of anything until 3 days post partum. My milk didn't come in until 9 days post partum. Diligent pumping helped, and after a really difficult start I now have an (intentional) over supply. If this is something you are really concerned about, be pushy about pumping in the hospital.
Parenting X Thanks! &gt; Be supportive of her, her body is about to completely transformed.  Noted  &gt;Father to be books are stupid. They will talk down to you and try to be funny. They aren't. Read what your wife  is reading.  I agree. I have found some stuff online geared towards guys, but we are reading the same books.   &gt;Take it easy now. There isn't anything you can really do to prepare for the joy or responsibility that await. So  kick back and let the next 9 months go by nice and easy. You will have the rest of your life to worry about your kid.  Good point  &gt; Invest in sleep futures.  I don't know what this means  &gt; Don't be afraid to BE FUCKING EXCITED, its exciting stuff.  I AM!!!  &gt; Congrats!  Thanks!
TwoXChromosomes X I did wear panty liners but I got super itchy after about a month so I just stopped wearing them. :)
Parenting X I just like to get perspectives from those who have done it.  That is probably the route we'll want to go, though it's up to my wife ultimately since she's the one giving birth.  We had a good experience at the birthing center because she was able to give birth in the water and only a midwife &amp; assistant were present, no drugs pushed or even offered, I cut the cord and he was given right back to my wife in the tub.  But it was still inside of a hospital, and soon thereafter they started bothering us unnecessarily, moved us into a much less comfortable room but wouldn't let us leave, etc.  Left a bad taste in our mouths.  
Parenting X My options for OBs was very limited because of my health insurance (military) so that made it much harder to find someone.. but I did the best I could and made my voice heard and asked LOTS of questions. The pushing aspect moved pretty quickly.. 2 hours total. I did tear, though, but that's kind of because he was a 9 lb 4 oz baby and I'm very petite. We birthed in the same room that we stayed in, and my son was able to stay right with us in the room. We also had people coming in to talk to us about breastfeeding, keeping ourselves healthy, and just offering superb care to me... They were really out of this world.
TwoXChromosomes X I suppose it's possible for the cup to become a bit misaligned if your muscles move it about, but you can prepare for that by just having a pantyliner on. I've used the cup for about 10 years and the worst I've ever had was a bit of spotting - nothing an ultra thin pantyliner couldn't catch - when I forgot to empty the cup on time during heavy flow. I've never had problems with activities, but then again I'm not the sportiest person around. I've done martial arts with the cup on and have been fine.
BabyBumps X They were always telling my I was measuring large, at 36 weeks I was measuring 43 weeks. The ultrasound showed I was going to have a 9 1/2-10 pound baby, she ended up being 8.6 pounds. On the bigger end, but still well within normal. I'm yet to hear an ultrasound *ever* in my entire life be right about a babies weight. Every person I know the weight has been +/- 2 pounds. Wouldn't worry about it at all! 
BabyBumps X 5-6 weeks is the standard when pregnancy symptoms can be easily distinguished from just PMS symptoms.  I've been TTC for 2 years now...I've imagined all sorts of symptoms for myself. The only true way to tell before your expected period is to get a positive pregnancy test.  Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X basically if i miss a dose it says I could become pregnant within the *next* 7 days, so basically if I don't have sex I am fine?  Because I can not have sex for 7 days I'm cool  no one ever told me how missing a dose makes you pregnant.  now i know.
BabyBumps X Stopping cold turkey is just as hard on the fetus, they go into nicotine withdrawal and I've always heard it's better to taper it off and eventually stop altogether, than quitting cold turkey.
BabyBumps X Hi, I've been a smoker fo 15 years (started as a teen). when i found out i was pregnant, i quit cold turkey, i was lucky i could. Whatever you do will be right for you, cutting  down is already helping.   Here is what helped me, but it may not help you...I read something like this when i found out i was pregnant, it helped me stop cold turkey that very minute.   When you light up a cigarette, imagine your baby (as a newborn) in a glass box. when you inhale, the smoke pours directly into the box, you cant see your child. every time you exhale the box empties, but gets grayer. if you inhale again the baby coughs, and then dissapears in the smoke..... that was as far as i got before i turned off the laptop and butted out my smoke. 
TwoXChromosomes X im not talking about babies being born feet-first or something, im talking about women who choose to get it surgically done even if theres nothing wrong with their pregnancy, the drugs they give them screw up the baby and the mom. 
TwoXChromosomes X I feel your pain. When I had my scoliosis surgery at age 12, I got my period while I was still in the hospital and unable to get out of bed. At least I couldn't feel the cramps with all of that morphine.   Hope you feel better soon!
TwoXChromosomes X Sometimes Macys has a really good clearance section. The dresses there are pretty nice also. Maybe you can just spend the 60 on a dress and wear shoes you already own or borrow a pair from a girlfriend!
BabyBumps X Yes. They were measuring my daughter at 8 lbs at 34 weeks. She was boorn at 36 weeks and weighed 6 lbs 4oz.
BabyBumps X My hubby gets up with our other baby. But I have really bad morning sickness, if I did is be throwing up the whole time.
TwoXChromosomes X I only say this, because on the Baby Bumps subreddit, the OP has flair that says that she is Trying to Conceive #3. So I thought someone who wanted the baby they are already pregnant with could use some support too. 
BabyBumps X I think it's standard because it's one of the most common and easily detectable causes of heart defects and mental retardation, and many women would want to abort.  I'd want to abort, so of course I wanted to get the testing so I could do it earlier rather than later. But I guess if you wouldn't you could wait until the 20 week. 
BabyBumps X Works the opposite way too. My best friends son was estimated at 7.5 lbs (I was in the room when they told her that!) 12 hours later she delivered a 9lb1oz baby boy!
BabyBumps X That's what happened to me too. My placenta with my first was on the front of my uterus so everything was muted until she was 19 weeks. I'm feeling stuff now on my right side but I don't know where my placenta is until my US end of January. 
BabyBumps X I am going in for my amnio at 16 weeks on Friday, and the tech the last time said they'd do what bits of the anatomy they could that day. But, we'll find out from the amnio whether it's a boy or girl. If I were wanting that info, I'd wait to make sure stuff is formed and whatnot. But I'm impatient too, and if I had the opportunity to know before xmas I would. Maybe try for Friday, and then you're 'almost 19' weeks ;-)
TwoXChromosomes X It is your choice, but know that you are not alone.   [ About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.]( _induced_abortion.html)  So, there is a majority of women making this difficult choice because they already have children depending on them. 
TwoXChromosomes X I guess this isn't as awkward as some of the post here, but every time I go to my annual, my doctor makes small talk with me while her face is between my legs, giving me a pap smear/sticking fingers or various other gynecological instruments inside me. She says things like "Oh, I always preferred getting my annual than going to the dentist. I hate the dentist!" or "It looks like rain, I kind of hope it rains, I don't really want to go to my son's little league game today." 
TwoXChromosomes X Did you use the 3 or 7 day treatment?   If you used the one day treatment: that stuff is crap. It's the messy long term treatment that works. Inconvenient and gross but when you did a cheap fix, that's the way to go.  edit: also, call them. If you have chronic infections or at least regular ones, they might be willing to write you a scrip without you coming in. Just explain you know what it is, can they please provide you with the relief you need without having to come in?
TwoXChromosomes X You might just have thicker discharge. Unless it is chunky, vaginal discharge comes in a bunch of different thicknesses. Though, I'm sure your doctor knows better than me.  I find it helps a bunch to eat yogurt that has probiotics in it. There are also some juices and cheeses that have probiotics. The theory here is that these probiotics will go through your digestive system, then when you poop the bacteria climbs from your but to your vagina. Seems a little counterintuitive, so some women swear by dipping a small tampon in probiotic yogurt and shoving it up there. My roommate has had success with this several times. If you are doing the tampon version, make sure the yogurt is plain and sugar free.  My mom swears by taking a hot bath and pouring some vinegar on your cooter. She is a nurse, so I'd say even if it doesn't work, it sure isn't going to hurt you.
TwoXChromosomes X Blood tests for HSV2 anti-bodies are very inaccurate. The best way to get a test done is wait for any suspicious sores to erupt, then have a culture done. If you aren't showing signs, you're just working yourself up. This isn't to say a broad spectrum blood/urine test every year is a bad idea, but no strain of HSV is typically included on them.  HSV2 is very distinct and pretty easy to self-diagnose (especially if you've ever had a cold sore... or go on Google images.)
TwoXChromosomes X To you, they're the same thing.  To me, they are not.  Because literally, they are not.  One is about the right to terimnate a pregnancy (and he's *not* against it in cases of rape/incest, or where the mother's life is at risk...), and I don't agree with him on that.  But that does not equate to *all* women's rights. 
BabyBumps X Well I kind of fault them for looking out for themselves but I get it. It's just IRRITATING as all hell. I'm really vitamin D deficient and they just told me to keep taking 2000IU's a day which didn't do jack shit infact my levels still went down and to get sunlight in the WINTER. He's leaching my vitamin D which is compromising  my calcium absorption. They told me it's OK for now if I am deficient if I am taking 2000IU's, calcium and prenatal pills. My Level is at an 11. I spoke to a few midwives who told me for free it's OK to do 4,000 IU's until my levels increase.  Sucks my insurance won't cover a doula/midwife but you know whatever.
TwoXChromosomes X Good luck. I found the NuvaRing to be really pleasant, and never had any side effects. It has a very, very low dosage of hormones compared to pills, and it is delivered directly rather than systemically, so many of the hormonal side effects are minimized. If an IUD doesn't work out for some reason, you should definitely consider it. 
BabyBumps X *hugs* I think the last couple weeks are the hardest weeks all around. They just stink. You reach a point where it's easier to have him/her outside then inside of you. Labor vibes! I hope you have a successful VBAC and baby decides to come out very soon! 
BabyBumps X You need to call a doctor and have them see you. It could be a miscarriage, or not, only a doctor can tell you. Some spotting and cramping is normal, but it's hard to pin point exactly when one is too much. *hugs* 
BabyBumps X Hm, well there's the possibility that it's a blighted ovum, or maybe the yolk was just hard to see. They could barely see mine.  The only thing you can do is try to wait it out. Hardest thing EVER. After I got that first ultrasound, I went back 2 weeks later for another one. This time they saw a yolk for sure and a fetal pole.   Good luck &lt;3
TwoXChromosomes X Let me clarify, because that is not the distinction I intended to make.  I read the word "hinges" as an essential determining factor, a central element.  So when you say that sexual harassment hinges on creating a threat of assault, I read that to say that the deliberate threat of assault is a defining factor in sexual harassment.  But sexual harassment is a broader concept, that can exist even without any (deliberate or not) threat of assault.   For example, the legal claim for QPQ workplace SH would apply whether or not the victim feared assault.    So, I do not see sexual harassment as hinging on the threat of assault at all.  My comment that "it can certainly create the fear of assault" was intended to convey that the victim's feelings of fear can exist (and are valid, we should care about them) whether or not the perpetrator intended to create them.
TwoXChromosomes X Not exactly, it just be less common for women to have abortions. You can try and argue the merits for having an abortion over having never need an abortion, but I don't think you'll make a good case. Most women I know that have had them state it is an unfortunate situation to be in. I would like to limit the amount of women that get to the point where they have to consider having an abortion.   I cannot see the act of an abortion as some intrinsic good/right that should be afforded to women. However, there is obviously a need for such a procedure. You can advocate for the free access to the procedure all you want, I will work on eliminating the need. 
BabyBumps X We were unsure of a due date, so we had to have an ultrasound pretty shortly after finding out we were pregnant. I went in and saw only the yolk sac. No fetal pole! And I was measuring for 6 weeks.   Later found out I was only 5w2d then. My baby has grown perfectly and has a strong heartbeat today at 14w1d. I even think I may be feeling some early bubbly movements. =]  It's ok to not see anything at 5 weeks. Try to stay optimistic. 
TwoXChromosomes X I mean, why shouldn't they? Knowledge and acceptance of teenagers having sex is so widespread today and considering they're usually the age group that is far less educated about sex and proper use of contraceptives, why not make EC more accessible for everybody? Especially for the teens who may not be able to afford even half of it on their own. There are coupons for everything and I think that there should be far more coupons for birth control and emergency contraceptive. 
TwoXChromosomes X I know, right? So ridiculous. Old enough to have sex but not old enough to make responsible decisions about contraception?? There's no age limit for condoms!
TwoXChromosomes X You're really simplifying what abortion is about. It's not "more about whether you're committing murder." It might be about that if you're a bystander or something and some person you don't know very well is pregnant. If you yourself have an unwanted pregnancy, your very life could be in the balance. Or, if you have a dangerous pregnancy that needs to be terminated for you to live. Suddenly, your life is sometimes seen as less valuable than the life of an unborn fetus. You're seen as nothing but a vessel to carry that fetus.
TwoXChromosomes X These are philosophical questions, not scientific questions.  When does a "person" become protected by law?  When they are out of the womb?  Half way out of the womb?  First trimester?  Second trimester?  Conception itself?  It is hardly so cut and dry, although both sides will lead you to believe there is no argument.
TwoXChromosomes X You seem to think subsidized access to birth control doesn't decrease unwanted pregnancies.  You are incorrect on this issue.
TwoXChromosomes X You've got to be a little more clear when calling someone a "fucking idiot". What you linked to appears to be a zygote. A zygote and a baby are two different stages of human development. Regardless, you're use of the word "life" is puzzling, and I believe incorrect.   I do not understand how you (or anyone) can argue that a zygote isn't alive. The process is well understood. Zygote, embryo, fetus (with several stages in between zygote and embryo) at which point would you think it switches from not being alive to being alive?   Now, I'm not going to go so far as to say it's a person (and thus regarded as legally protected by US law), but I don't think you have a legitimate argument over it being alive or not. 
BabyBumps X She was 10lbs 6oz. Now at one month she is 11lbs 4oz and she has grown 3 inches!!!   I'm so thankful she was a bigger baby because it likely helped to save her life. She had severe meconium aspiration which caused pulmonary hypertension. The first 48 hours we werent sure she would survive.   After 22 days in the NICU and 6 figures worth of medical care she is home. Healthy. 
TwoXChromosomes X If a pregnant woman is killed by a drunk driver, the driver is responsible for both her life and the life inside her.  So why is a fetus considered life in *that* scenario, but not considered life if the woman chose to abort.  Does her choice to abort make the fetus any less of a life?  Why should a woman's right to choose supersede that of the child's right to live?
TwoXChromosomes X I have no children but am planning on them in the future. I have two friends who have gotten pregnant after Mirena - one almost immediately, one took a few months, but neither of them had problems as far as I know, and I don't feel that it's risking my fertility to have one.   I had some of the same problems you describe and getting an IUD totally turned me around. Your mileage may vary but it's one of the best sexual health related things I ever did for myself.  The IUD is the best method of BC out there - perfect use gives it a 99.8% success rate and the 0.2% is from things like improper insertions, the IUD shifting and expelling partially or fully, and rarely people do just get pregnant while it's in there. But that's extremely rare.  You should still use condoms with one as it won't protect against STDs, but for pregnancy protection it can't be beat. Definitely talk to your gyno, but if they're not interested in inserting one for a woman who's not married and hasn't had kids (it happens :P) try a local Planned Parenthood, women's centre or sexual health clinic for referrals.  good luck!  edit: if you can handle the very low dose of hormones in Mirena, one of its side effects is that you can stop having a period. That happened to me and I have to say it's kind of awesome. :) I mention this since I saw your comment about heavy irregular periods.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a microbiologist in a hospital. Tampons are just fine if used correctly. Just make sure you use the right size for your flow. Don't leave them in too long. (More than 8 hrs). Don't change them too frequently if they arent  really absorbing much i.e. your flow has become light. If you take them out when they are too dry they can cause small abrasions in your vaginal wall. This is how bacteria can cause infection. I've only seen TSS once in 7 years. This girl left her tampon in for over a month. Tampons are the only thing I use. 
TwoXChromosomes X Obviously it's safer to use two, no one was saying it wasn't.  Of course using condoms, spermicide, birth control pills, etc. is the safest but your comment was that just using BC is not safe or effective.  I really felt safe (and my gyno agreed) in my last relationship just using BC pills because STDs were not a concern and I can honestly say I did not take it late even once and used backup if effectiveness was compromised for any reasons.  Understandably people need to be aware of the effectiveness but that hardly means it isn't safe or reasonable to use it alone.
TwoXChromosomes X I never take the placebos, I just take the three week's worth of pills, then throw out the placebos and don't take anything for a week when it's period week.
TwoXChromosomes X That's the same as actually taking the placebos. The placebos are just there to remind you to do take it every day, so if you just keep taking the pills everyday, skipping the placebos and the week off, you should regulate out to not have a period and then you can restart your cycle for when you want it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Also, talk to your DR about the hormonal IUD. They have extremely low doses of hormones, so it might not affect your body at all.   The copper IUD (paragard) could actually make your periods worse. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've never had that happen to me. Not saying it isn't normal, but I've never had anything in my anus at the gyno since I've been going for the last 9 years.   If you're not comfortable, change doctors. They should be giving you a heads up about anything they do, especially instertion-wise. 
TwoXChromosomes X First of all, [the majority of women who get abortions WERE using contraception, although many of them were using it incorrectly]( _induced_abortion.html) (thanks, abstinence-only sex ed!). And even when birth control is used correctly, it's still not 100% effective - even in an ideal world where everyone had access to free birth control, some people would still have unwanted pregnancies.  Legal abortion is NOT more dangerous than childbirth. You are using a pro-life website to get that information. "[The risk of death associated with abortion increases with the length of pregnancy, from one death for every one million abortions at or before eight weeks to one per 29,000 at 1620 weeksand one per 11,000 at 21 or more weeks]( _induced_abortion.html)" vs a maternal mortality rate of "[12.7 \[deaths\] per 100,000 live births]( )". 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm intrigued  by the diva cup as I like the idea of not tearing up my vag with tampons and blood other bodily fluid bother me not at all. But I hate the idea of not being able to figure it out right away. And if I run the risk of it leaking as I HATE wearing panties, let alone panty liners for safety.  Has anyone been able to use theirs nor problem, from the get go?  Edit: wow, sorry about all the spelling/grammar errors. It's stupid trying to type on my phone.
TwoXChromosomes X You are incorrect about how hormonal forms of birth control work. They work by preventing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and thinning the lining of the uterus. There is a *theory* that they might also prevent implantation, but there is no evidence that this actually happens.
TwoXChromosomes X Bladder infection? Happened to me once under those circumstances. Any burning when you pee? Your chemist might sell urinalysis dipsticks, in which case it wouldn't hurt to pee on one and have a look. White blood cells (pyuria) or blood (haematuria) would be indicative of a bladder infection. If yes, get thee to a doctor for some antibiotics, and some Ural (I think in the States it's called Azo?)  If it's not a bladder infection, I wouldn't worry too much. You usually don't have to rush off to the doctor until it happens more than once. Just keep an eye on things and consider an appointment if you get any other symptoms.
BabyBumps X The pain is definitely normal. Around where you are that's the only symptom I had as well. (And I'm 19 with almost no risk for miscarriage) Before I found out I was pregnant, I thought they were just horrible period cramps. It's just you're uterus stretching though so no worries! Congrats and try not to worry! Stress is he last thing you want for the baby :] Good luck with everything!
TwoXChromosomes X That sounds like what I've experienced. Before I went on the pill, I would get cramps that incapacitated me, where I would be non-functioning for about 10 days (counting before my cycle). The fact that you cramp when you orgasm doesn't sound normal, though. The hormones released when you orgasm are actually supposed to help reduce cramps, not make them worse. You might consider going on hormonal birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X A lot of people associate having that much sex with having sexually transmitted diseases. I don't think it has to do with them thinking you're a bad person - they just think it's dangerous.  You can use the opportunity to educate them. :-) You're being safe. Are they? Sometimes having unprotected sex with just ONE person can spread an STD. Hell, ask them if they need a condom. I used to hand them out. lol
TwoXChromosomes X Cut the tip off! Oh god, I did that after the first 15 minutes and I've been usuing it just fine for over a year since =)  And there are quite a few folding methods, so there's got to be one that is more comfortable for you =/  I find squatting in the shower to be best - especially because moisture makes insertion easier. Have you thought about trying the luna cup or any of the thinner cups out there?
TwoXChromosomes X Ever heard of birth control failure? Condoms being faulty? Shit happens. 
TwoXChromosomes X it's not the material, it's the condensed amount of it. it's the same problem with flushing paper towels. too many in a short amount of time could clog plumbing - especially if you don't know how the system will handle it.  Nothing more embarrassing than having to use a plunger and bringing up a ton of bloody tampons.
TwoXChromosomes X You can safely wear the diva cup when you are not on your period, so why don't you take it for a dry run first? Once you are confident in your method, you can use it for your next period!  BTW - if you bleed like me, there's no help panties or a liner can provide if that thing spills. For serious. I have to be extra sure that it covers my cervix or else it's trouble after about 10 minutes, but that may be because my lower anatomy is a little out of whack.
BabyBumps X I did not express any colostrum until after my baby was born.  It took two painful feedings for me to get some going.  Now at two weeks, I am breast feeding while typing this.  Your body will make it when it's time :) 
TwoXChromosomes X I find that water-based Yes and Sliquid Natural/Organics are the most soothing for me to use, because most other water-based lube contains glycols, parabens and glycerin, which can all cause pain in sensitive people.  I use a tapered vibrator before intercourse to gradually open me up (just go at the pace your body wants to work at) and provide massage. I find that cowgirl (girl on top) position is the most comfortable for me because it opens me up a lot.  Pelvic floor physiotherapy helped my muscles work a lot better. I had severe vaginismus before that completely prevented intercourse or pap tests.
BabyBumps X I was induced at 41 weeks, and the doc used Misoprostol. He said it probably wouldn't work and they would need to progress to Pitocin, but shortly after they sent me home after applying it my contractions started in full force. They actually didn't believe I was in labor though, so thankfully my mom took me to the hospital when she did.  I can't compare the contractions to non-induced ones (yet) but they were debilitatingly painful. I didn't do anything all day but lay in the tub and in bed. I didn't want an epidural originally, but I ended up getting one, and I was still in pain. Anyway, it worked for me when I was overdue. I also didn't tear or need a c-section. I was effaced a good bit though before application. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; you adopt a non-standard definition of abortion  What you said  &gt; the death of the embryo or fetus  What I said  &gt; deliberate termination/miscarriage  The same thing I said   Do you speak for all women, or just the really stupid ones?  Killing the fetus has NOTHING to do with the life and safety of the mother.  NOTHING.  The issues of the life and safety of the mother have to do with the REMOVAL of the fetus.  The fetus can live or die on its own.  It does not have to be killed to be removed and it does not have to be removed to be killed.  That is what Ron Paul said.  That is the true, actual, medical reality.  You make a choice to kill a fetus out of convenience, never necessity.   Let me spell it out so your slow mind can understand:  in every definition of abortion, the fetus is dead.  Dead fetus.  That is an abortion.  Can you understand that? I can't really use smaller words here.  DEAD BABY.  DEAD BABY.  GOT IT?  /slam derp 
TwoXChromosomes X I did.  And then I read the stats I linked to.  Pulling out had a low failure rate when done properly, but it's much harder to ensure that withdrawal is done right every time than to make sure a condom is put on every time.  And if you don't do withdrawal right all the time, then it's a 27% failure rate, compared to 12% with a diaphragm and 18% with condoms.  It's one of the easiest methods to screw up, but that doesn't make it an invalid method in and of itself.  A 27% chance of getting pregnant is still much lower than an 85% chance (which is no contraceptives at all), so it is birth control  Would I ever recommend that someone use withdrawal as their primary form of birth control?  Hell, no, because it's too easy to screw up, especially since a woman has no real control over it.  Does that mean we should stop considering it a valid form of birth control? No, because it is valid.
TwoXChromosomes X From what I recall, you are supposed to give your body at least a month to start getting adjusted to new birth control. I would recommend making an appointment with your gyno if after a full month or two you are still experiencing these symptoms. She/he can recommend a different birth control to try, which might have different results.   I've been on two different kinds since going on birth control, neither of which are in pill form - the Patch and now the Ring. Both have relatively high doses of estrogen. I think I did better mood-wise on the Patch but overall I am relatively "normal" and experience little to no side effects. 
TwoXChromosomes X I do not know who downvoted you, you're absolutely right.  Copper IUD's specifically won't have nearly as many side effects ad hormonal ones and can last anywhere between 5-15 years, depending on the type. The only down side is your period might get (temporarily) heavier and that you really have to be sure you're not allergic to copper.
TwoXChromosomes X or a bad plumber who put in the extra toilet just didn't do the proper work to make the system handle it.  i would have straight up said "i live with 4 dudes. i'm pretty sure their franks-and-beans megadumps are doing more damage to your system than my uterine sheddings."
TwoXChromosomes X It's different for everybody, dude. It's not necessarily a matter of being better at handling it at *all.*  For some women it is quite literally agonizing. My periods are mild in terms of cramping and nausea and headaches and general misery, but I still spend a couple of days feeling like someone has hammered my labia together.  I know women who can hardly get out of bed due to the pain.  For some of us it *is* the 'worst thing,' and your tone is kinda nasty.  For my mother, the onset of her period always came with blinding migraines and cramps that would double her over in the middle of whatever she was doing.   You'd 'moan and cry' too, I think.
BabyBumps X I really like the Mayo Clinic Guide to Pregnancy.  Still aimed at a woman but full of great info and more scientific.  :)
BabyBumps X My plan is hospital birth with an epidural. With MY OB/GYN or one from his practice.
TwoXChromosomes X What I mean is that a person should have control over what happens with their own body, including the right to an abortion.  I don't see the fetus as wholly separate in any way which would give it rights as a human.  In my view, the fetus only probably has a right against unnecessary suffering (meaning the right to a safe abortion where fetal pain is minimized if it is significantly late term).
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, but now that I've had a baby I find it's true what they say: You forget the pain.  Logically I know I was in a lot of pain and it was a pretty horrible experience while I was going through it, but now, my son is here and it doesn't really matter. It's amazing how quickly you start forgetting how it was.... our bodies are made to cope with the pain of childbirth.    Research different childbirth methods and be prepared so you know what you're getting in to.  Have an "ideal" birth plan and then be ready to change it because nothing will ever go according to plan.    It sound so cliche but it ends up being totally worth it. 
BabyBumps X Ah sweet that she turned herself. Did you had a natural birth on Monday after your water broke down or you have an emergency c section? I have also head that having a loop of chord around the neck are mostly for baby Boys, have you heard such a thing?
BabyBumps X Yep I think i am not left with an option of natural birth, I don't want to risk it with a vaginal breech delivery. This is my first time.  I personally was looking for a C section to avoid the natural delivery ( to avoid to go through labor etc). I read on here that most of the women prefer natural births over C section. I am looking for some good source to read the comparison ( C over Natural).
BabyBumps X I had 20 hours of labor and then a c-section; she was aimed at my hip socket and convince that was the exit.  I wonder sometimes whether if I had known she was turned and not had to go in immediately... You know, I would have been able to labor t home a while, walk, eat, drink.... Maybe she would have settled into the right position.  As it was , believing her still to be breech, we had to go right away, and it cut out a lot of possible moving around time.   The hospital I went to was very ok with walking and all, but as with any hospital, there were tests and wires that were confining at least some of the time.
BabyBumps X The baby can definitely still turn around. I have heard some women who were in breech up until they went into labor and the baby FINALLY flipped. The loop around the cord... idk much about that but in some of the scans a friend had the baby was playing with it.
BabyBumps X I'm planning to keep my visitors to family only. My friend allowed a BUNCH of people to come visit her immediately following the birth of her son. Her son ended up spending several weeks in NICU because he got the flu. 
BabyBumps X The loop isn't that big a deal so long as it's not super short. They're still getting oxygen through the cord, it isn't until the face touches air that they start trying to breathe.  If you don't want to schedule a c-section what you can do is ask for a trial of labor with a midwife and an OB as a backup in case of emergencies, and if the baby doesn't flip during labor they can easily section you right there.
TwoXChromosomes X I see what you're saying, don't worry. I've used toys in the past, and regularly try with vibrators, it just doesn't work, even when I'm alone. I have a feeling I'm mentally blocking myself. 
BabyBumps X The breaking water thing is actually proving to be counterproductive. If you are already dilating well sometimes it will speed up labor because of the force that the head puts on the cervix-- however I disagree with the practice. Your forewaters present before the baby does, so if you have intact membranes, with each contraction your amniotic sac bulges forward and balloons through the cervix. This forces each contraction to be more effective and you dilate faster. It's the same thing they do when they manually dilate the cervix with their fingers, only more gentle. Not to mention, the longer the amniotic sac is intact the longer you can "safely" labor without risk of infection (or rather, minimal risk of infection).   What i have found effective, and used in my own birth when I stalled at 6cm is: position index and thumb on either side of the fontanel (you do have to be dilated a little bit) through the cervix and gently push upward (GENTLYGENTLYGENTLY) until you feel a little 'flood' of amniotic fluid. Stop pushing up and baby will re-engage, and that will help during labor because there will be a greater amount of pressure on the cervix.
TwoXChromosomes X That chart is accurate. Using spermicide with condoms (but not spermicidal condoms) is more effective than condoms alone - something to consider!
BabyBumps X I'm an ultrasound tech, which is likely what the girl who did your scan was too. She should have explained to you who she was and that at that early stage it's very difficult to get a heartbeat or see a yolk sac or a fetal pole, and often your dates may be off by up to a week or so. Many labs will do ultrasounds that early to look for a decidual reaction or to ascertain if your actual conception date is earlier than you thought, but even if you know the day in theory :), the actual conception may have taken a bit longer to occur too, so please don't worry yet, just go back in another few weeks and they will be able to tell u something more definitive :).
BabyBumps X Bleeding can be "normal" during pregnancy. I had some unexplained bleeding with my last pregnancy off and on for about two weeks. I had a prior miscarriage so I thought I was miscarrying again. I went on to have a healthy pregnancy. Now I'm spotting again about the same time I was in my last pregnancy. While it is unnerving, I understand now that it is common so I'm not freaking out. I'm taking it easy and staying hydrated.  If she does miscarry, the best thing you can do is just be there for her.
BabyBumps X I have "Natural Childbirth The Bradley Way" and she bought my husband "Husband Coached Childbirth", though he hasn't really been reading it since he's been too busy with work. We really need to take a class, I think, otherwise he probably will have no idea what to do. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is a serious question- has science come to a consensus as to precisely when life begins? If you have any information on that I'd appreciate a link.    As far as I know, believing that life begins at conception is just as valid as believing that it starts at any other time on the continuum from fertilization to birth.  I guess it depends on your definition of "life."
TwoXChromosomes X I think diva cups are awesome, but I think you should use tampons a few times before you use a diva cup. They require more familiarity with your body if you ask me.   I'm 22, and have a 21 year old friend who's a virgin, and she has never used tampons (she's just too scared, no other reason). So you're not alone.  If you do buy some tampons, get slim ones the first time. Super ones might hurt, and are only necessary if you have a really heavy flow anyway.  Good luck!
BabyBumps X I'm using an obgyn/midwife practice. The birthing suite is in a hospital. Your appointments are all with the midwives and you get delivered by a midwife but this way in case anything goes wrong, you do have doctors all around and are already at a hospital. I'm just over 15 weeks and have loved dealing with my midwife practice so far, no complaints at all!
BabyBumps X &gt;However, if there is any possibility of your pregnancy being high-risk, please consider an OB.  A home birth midwife or birthing center midwife will not take high-risk patients. If they are in the hospital, and then it doesn't matter, because there are doctors and surgeons 3 feet in every direction.
BabyBumps X I would have loved a midwife, but I wanted my doctor to be close. I had pre-existing hypertension too so I was concerned. I didn't need an OB after all, my birth and pregnancy was great. I wish all women had what I had.    I know it's a while before labor, but I do suggest hiring a doula whichever way you go. My doula was amazing. 
BabyBumps X Look, I understand where you're coming from, but some women really do have terrible morning sickness.  No, they're not dying, but throwing up 8x a day for three months isn't exactly the easiest thing to tough out.  At one point, I was unable to keep food or liquids in me for longer than five minutes - for two weeks.  I was malnourished, dehydrated, and *still* felt awful.  I feel like I deserve to complain :).
BabyBumps X With my first child, I was up all night vomiting and pooping probably about...two weeks before I actually gave birth.  No idea what caused it, I could actually see what I had for supper the first time I threw up :/  Anyway, it eased at about 5am and I slept the rest of the day away and I was fine.  Your baby will be fine too, just keep doing what you're doing.  Get rest and clear fluids.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;but we weren't discussing a deductive argument so I don't really count those rules toward the explanation.  The three-premise argument previously outlined *is* deductive. To elaborate further and explicitly state some implicit premises:  P1. The entity formed by the union of gametes is a life.  P2. Abortion is the destruction of an entity that was formed by the union of gametes.  C1. Abortion is the destruction of a life.  P3. The destruction of a life is immoral.  C2. Abortion is immoral.  This is deductive, and valid. Arguably unsound, but definitely deductive.  The conclusions are *definitely entailed* by the premises if they are true. Not just "likely", as they would be if it was inductive.
TwoXChromosomes X My OB doctors told me I should gain 20-25 lbs during my pregnancy. What they didn't explain was that the weight gain shouldn't be fat that I actively try to pack on. Instead, the weight gain is comprised of baby-related things. Additional blood, amniotic fluid, placenta, and the baby itself (plus other things) comprise that recommended 20-25 lbs.  Chatting informally with my friends who are mothers, I discovered that all of them were not told about the above. They all thought they got to eat extra food and meals so they could gain weight. In reality, you only have to eat an extra 200-350 calories to help offset what the growing baby is taking from your nutritional stores.  Because of the nausea during the first trimester, I lost 10+ lbs, didn't gain any but the baby weight, and have kept off that 10. Once I stopped breastfeeding, all the weight left and after 6 months, my boobs were back to normal. The only thing that is different from before is a little belly pooch from having a big baby stretch out my belly skin. Jiggle-jiggle, but I don't care. Neither does my husband.  So, you can control how much you gain during pregnancy, and you can keep exercising to stay fit and healthy.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, there you go, symptom one: during PMS and sometimes during the period some women get irritable.
BabyBumps X Join a support group like la leche league. Read up on how to keep your supply up (like hand expressing in addition to pumping and feeding). Find out what your works policy is on how often you can take breaks to pump.  It can be done, but I can't guarentee it will be easy or successful even if you do all you can. 
BabyBumps X Try adding some pumping sessions while you're not at work, so that you have even more extra milk. Do this before you return. Remember that for every bottle of expressed milk your baby gets you need to pump to replace that feeding. It doesnt sound like you would be pumping enough to replace every feeding that the baby will be getting at home. Thats the most important thing to remember. **For every feeding that's not at the breast, pump. **If you end up needing to supplement, you can supplement with donated breast milk instead of formula. Talk to eats on feets or hm4hb, or contact a milk bank if you're not comfortable with informal milk sharing. If you are, you could also ask a friend or relative to donate milk if they feel ok with it. Talk to an ibclc or lll leader if you have any questions. Kellymom.com and beastforbabes.org are great resources too.
BabyBumps X I personally found the prepared childbirth class I took useless... I had read every piece of information already on the internet and in books.  The CPR class would definitely be good.  The breastfeeding class might be really helpful too, but going to LLL meetings or new nursing mom meetings at the hospital AFTER the baby is born would be even more helpful, and free!
BabyBumps X Child birth hurts. A LOT! However, your body is made to handle it and you'll get through it. I had a really rough labor and delivery so it may have only been horrible for me. It obviously wasn't **that** horrible since I'm pregnant again. Also, don't depend on the epidural to be a life saver. I was given an epidural twice and it didn't work. I thought there was no way I could have that baby with no pain meds, but I did it and you can too :) 
BabyBumps X I had an epidural, and I thought it was absolutely amazing. They numbed the site before they put it in and I didn't feel a thing. Once it was in, it was only a few minutes before relief of labor pains. Labor hurts, but not enough to be unmanageable. I had a very enjoyable experience with labor. Once pushing started, I was uncomfortable and there was a lot of pressure, but it didn't really hurt. My biggest problem was catching my breath. I couldn't calm myself down.   Overall, I loved experiencing labor and I will definitely have more. Everything about it was so rewarding. My only complaint is that I have some back aches where my epidural was. Apparently, this happens quite often and no one ever told me. It's not bad, just a dull ache from time to time.
TwoXChromosomes X It's probably harmless shedding, but overshedding sometimes signifies something bigger, like a vitamin deficiency. Take a multivitamin and talk to your doctor if you're really worried.  I just say this because I had a shedding problem that was due to an iron deficiency, but taking a daily multivitamin cleared the problem right up. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X The downside to thyroid issues is that many doctors aren't up on the new lab ranges.  I was lucky enough to find a GP doctor who will listen to my symptoms assuming I know my own body well enough to know when things aren't working right.  Oddly, my thyroid has been working better since getting pregnant (still on meds though).  I hope you eventually find a doctor who listens to you.
BabyBumps X As long as the first baby is head-down, the position of the 2nd baby shouldn't matter as much. I know 2 friends who had twins in my parenting group, and both of them vaginally delivered both, AND both of them the 2nd baby was footlong breach.  I guess one was frank breach at first but baby turned around and then was able to be delivered vaginally. Of course, they were both birthing with a midwife.
BabyBumps X Ok, so the nurse checked me at about 9:00 and I'm STILL at a 2.  Meanwhile, the contractions are hurting a lot and even though I'm controlling my breathing and trying to make sure my body is relaxed, this is really painful.  I wish I could get a good solid 5 minutes between contractions, I think that would help.  I took a half a dose of fentanyl.  It took enough of the edge off the contractions I at least stopped crying.  Hopefully the doctor will be here in about an hour and will check me again and I'll be further than a 2.  I am progressing in my effacement, so that's good.  Nurse is still awesome and gave me the brilliant idea of a cool wascloth on the forehead.  It helped a lot actually.  
BabyBumps X Omg.  I had a miscarriage earlier this year, and I will be 5 weeks on Saturday (I think.  I got my positive test on Xmas morning).   I don't feel much either.  A little back pain, my boobs aren't sore yet.  The only two strange symptoms I have are eye dryness, night sweats, and crappy sleep.      If you're anything like me, the lack of symptoms is making me feel crazy because of my previous miscarriage.  I *almost* wish that my symptoms were worse because I would feel more **pregnant**.      Thank you for posting this!  We've only told our parents, and it's hard to keep secrets.
TwoXChromosomes X if you're concerned about accuracy, get a 2 pack so you can double check.      just follow the directions. and yes ... they are very accurate.      your symptoms could easily be from stress compounded by fears **of** pregnancy.      you can do the test anytime, but again, follow the directions.   __________   why do people ask questions that require time to respond ony to delete? pisses me off.
TwoXChromosomes X One week is the typical waiting time for retaking pregnancy tests. Purchase another test in a week and retake it (unless you get your period in the interim).
BabyBumps X Huh, reading a few of the comments makes me wonder if that's why my labor was relatively "easy" ?  Yes, I had pretty awful period cramps.    Then when I was in labor, I wasn't really aware of it for a while.  I labored for a full day before my sister was like, "You're in labor!" and I went into the hospital to get checked out, fully believing that my sister would be proven wrong.  Nope, I was in labor.  The nurses were stunned too because I'd been walking around the hallways making jokes with my sister and laughing. 5 hours later my son was born.  Pushing took 30 minutes and it was my favorite part.
BabyBumps X I've been getting kicked in the cervix sometimes for a few weeks now and it's pretty damn uncomfortable. It almost feels like she's trying to kick her way out. I get kicked in the bladder pretty hard too, but it's not nearly as bad. At my last ultrasound I was told she's very low, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it. I can't wait until she flips around so I can get some relief! I also have been having pains on the inside of my thighs going down to my knee on and off, but lately it's only when I'm sleeping. I don't know what that's all about. At least we are both almost done. lol.
BabyBumps X With our first, we made two or three calls from the birthing room and an email to my inlaws (they are living on another continent, so calling is expensive) shortly after. My parents told my brothers and grandparents and my grandma told all her kids (as she does everything). Facebook got to know once we left the hospital five days after birth.  With my second my husband got to know first (since he couldn't accompany me and my mom did), then my dad, he visited me in the L&amp;D ward afterwards (before being transferred to the new moms ward). Once my husband knew his youngest son and we made a family pic a couple of days after being transferred to my parents place (good a week after the birth), we sent out an email with this pic to family, facebook has yet to come.
TwoXChromosomes X I am also on Sronyx, and my partner and I always use condoms &amp; bc, but one time the condom broke and we got plan B just because we're Worrying Wendel and Wendy. I don't think it was necessary, but it set my mind at peace.  Even when I told the lady at the health clinic that the condoms they gave us broke BOTH times we used them (that's another rant in itself) so we got Plan B, she looked at me like I was an idiot and said "You don't need to get Plan B if the condom breaks. The pill is your backup method, not the condom." Which made me feel a lot better.   I'm just super paranoid about everything, but I would think you're fine. 
TwoXChromosomes X Kegel it out. Seriously. Relax the muscles and push a little. I sorta squat down, either on the floor or over the toilet and kegel. Comes right out. It does take a little practice but don't panic, it won't stay in forever.   After you kegel, slide one finger along the side to break the suction and then you can pinch the cup to pull it out. Hope that helps.
TwoXChromosomes X I had an awful time on HBC, I went on two types and the choices were pretty much suicidal or non stop migraine.  So when I went on a non hormonal IUD it was absolutely brilliant.  Of course everyone deals with hormones differently, if everyone had my experience on HBC then HBC probably wouldn't be very sucessful, but the pill can have a major effect on your body in lots of ways. 
TwoXChromosomes X Dang your body moves fast. I take my last active pill before the week of placebos, and I don't start bleeding until 4 days in.  I'm still bleeding when I start the new pack.  Edit: that number was supposed to be a 4, not a 5.
TwoXChromosomes X One time immediately following sexytimes: I haven't take a birth control pill for *three days*. Aaaaaand panic.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're wearing disposable pads all the time, consider switching to cloth. Disposable pads aren't particularly breathable and tend to increase odor, in my experience.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm the same way. I start bleeding 3 or 4 days in to the placebos, and I always wondered if that was weird haha When I first started taking HBC I remember freaking out because I didn't start bleeding until the day before I started my new pack. 
TwoXChromosomes X It took me a long time to get used to it. I don't think I was really comfortable with the diva until I was having regular sex. Some of the other cups are smaller, based on photo evidence, so you may need one of those.  Once you get a cup working for you, though, it is amazing. I have such a heavy period I still have to use a pad with the cup. But I'm not all sore from ripping out tampons, so my period is much more pleasant. Do find whatever one works for you.
TwoXChromosomes X For one thing, TELL your doctor that you're sexually active. Seriously. It's best to be as honest as possible with your doctors.  The recommendation in the US is to start having pap smears at 21 or 3 years after you become sexually active, whichever comes first. You can probably ask your GP about getting a referral.
TwoXChromosomes X Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in women and in about 10% of cases is extremely fast growing. The early stages are often asymptomatic and by the time signs are seen you could be in the advanced stages.  No offense, but this sounds more like American-bashing than actual advice.  The reason Americans have a lower instance of cervical cancer is Because we are "held hostage" by annual gynecology appointments. As someone who had two irregular paps and was scared to death, they had me come back every 3 months - that's how fast it can grow.  If she is sexually active and has access to health care that allows her to have a pap smear once a year, she should make and keep those appointments.  This is really bad advice.
AskWomen X That feeling-like-I-still-hafta-pee sensation is a telltale sign of a urinary tract infection (urethra, bladder, or worst-case: kidneys). Best to go to a doctor to get antibiotics, however some people are able to fend it off with lots and lots of water (a LOT) and/or cranberry juice. I'm not talking about cranberry juice cocktail, I'm talking about real cranberry juice. Sugar (added to most juice), caffeine, alcohol, and high-carb diets can all aggravate a UTI. Urinating before and immediately after sex will help prevent UTI's, and there are also supplements that can be taken to help in treatment of symptoms as well as prevention. There are at-home tests available in drugstores, to help determine if there is a UTI present. These and most likely the supplements can be found in the same area as pads/tampons, condoms, yeast infection creams, pregnancy tests, etc. Good luck! 
TwoXChromosomes X What she meant to say is it won't be *as* effective.  If you follow the instructions in the birthcontrol box (take another pill today) the efficacy of your birth control won't be affected very much.  To be on the safe side you could use a condom, but it's probably not necessary
AskWomen X Are you waiting until it's financially responsible, or until you can afford to provide a certain life style for your child? You don't necessarily have to pay for their college, you know...
TwoXChromosomes X His parents may be more than willing to support you more, because of the baby. Don't jump right to abortion, I'd definitely talk to your bf first and see what he thinks. You could very well make it work! But if abortion is your best option, you should do it. Just carefully weigh your options first. I'm pro-choice, but I still hope everyone faced with that choice thinks about everything very carefully. Best of luck! Update when you can :D
BabyBumps X I bled several times in my first trimester and I had blood clots in the toilet also. It turned out to be partial placenta previa which they didn't find until the third time I went in for bleeding. It seemed to happen if I had sex recently (within a few days) and anytime I worked out. I stopped working out, stopped having sex and stopped lifting anything heavy and the bleeding went away. I started working out, having sex, etc in the second trimester with no bleeding.   They say if you fill 1 or 2 pads (?) within 1 or 2 hours (?) to go to the emergency room (I can't remember the exact amount). I would call your doctor tomorrow to get in for a sonogram. I wouldn't wait a week because you will just stress yourself out and it will make you feel so much better to see that the baby is ok. 
TwoXChromosomes X Vestibulitis would be inflammation of the vestibule (the entrance to the vagina). Vaginismus is a condition in which inserting anything into the vagina is incredibly painful or even physically impossible, although nothing is obviously inflamed. 
TwoXChromosomes X Buying a menstrual cup will save you SO MUCH money, discomfort, and worrying. Pads are noisy and synthetic or bleached cotton against your vag is terribly unhealthy - can lead to lots of yeast infections if your poon can't breathe. The feeling of putting in a tampon the wrong way and then having to yank it back out, chafing your insides?? Gone!! (That brought back bad memories for me... ick!)  Also, using a cup is much less wasteful.. and if you are going to travel, you don't have to worry about stocking up on supplies. 
BabyBumps X I've been experiencing the exact same thing since about 35 weeks. Wake up every hour or two to move on to my other side (which is quite an ordeal in itself), and whatever hip I've been laying on hurts like hell. I'm surrounded with pillows and one between my legs but it no longer helps. I asked my OB a few weeks ago and she didn't really have any suggestions other than Tylenol, so I've just given up and written it off as something I have to deal with until the baby comes.  What I hate the most about it is that every time I wake up, I have to lay there and figure out if I also need to get up and pee, or just roll over. If I choose poorly and stay in bed, the consequences can be pretty unpleasant the next time I wake up.
TwoXChromosomes X Ignore all urges to curl up.  Cramps need to be stretched out.  So stretch out your stomach muscles and you'll feel some relief.  Other than that, avoid caffeine like the plague (eating chocolate during my cycle makes my symptoms ten times worse and debilitating), bananas help (anything with magnesium or potassium really).  Also, I know you don't want to overmedicate, but I find that Midol 12 hour maximum strength helps A TON.  You only take one pill, and it's non drowsy...pretty much a miracle pill for me.  Hope that helps!
TwoXChromosomes X While HPV can rarely cause cervical cancer or genital warts, generally it's not that big of a deal.  [Here]( -HPV.htm#common) is some more information about it. 50% of sexually active men and women have it. 90% clear the virus in 2 years.  I'm not sure how long the virus can last outside the body. I would think transmission has a lot to do with mucus membrane contact, therefore I think it is unlikely that you would catch it from a razor or soap.
BabyBumps X &gt;What methods are you ladies using? Why? What has worked for you before? Any book suggestions?  The method we chose is "informed decision making": we always ask why, pros/cons, and what the alternatives are. The prenatal class we went to was lamaze, and they have stopped doing the breathing/make you do anything thing: it's all up to you and what you feel like doing, nowadays. I didn't "learn" much from the class, but I did meet a lot of other new moms, and the husband really "got into the baby thing" around that time. Started reading all the books, star pupil in our class, etc. His competitive nature kicking in, perhaps? So don't dismiss the classes right away.   Definitely get midwives if you can, or a doula at least if you can't. My midwives let me "do my thing" until the very end (pushing), where they helped me physically focus where I needed to push and when not to do it: no stitches for me all thanks to them! For books, I recommend The Birth Partner by Penny Simkin. 
TwoXChromosomes X That's weird. The doctor(nurse practitioner?) at Planned Parenthood said I shouldn't have a period on it. I'd get an IUD, but I honestly feel really scared about the process of having it put in and then freaked out by the idea of having it in there :(
TwoXChromosomes X I got mine in January 2010 (YAY TWO YEARS WITH MY COPPER). I got mine while I was on my period (naturally dilated cervix made it easier to insert) so I didn't notice a change in my period immediately but my period did last a little longer than usual, about 9 days long instead of its (now) usual 6-7. Next cycle was normal 28 days with 6-7 days of heavy bleeding.  If you've been bleeding for 3 weeks straight you should see your gyno, that doesn't sound right. Have you checked to make sure your strings are ok? Are you in any pain at all?
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for about 6 months. Insertion was nothing, but I had intense pain after sex and lotsa bleeding the first 3 or 4 weeks. Now I have some cramps before my periods, but the periods themselves are actually lighter and sometimes nonexistant, which isn't the norm, but it's AWESOME. I can't even handle the hormones in Mirena so this is the best thing I've ever had. It's like not being on birth control at all. It's the tits! Definitely go get checked if you're bleeding though, because I know they always want to check on you 6 weeks after insertion to make sure that exact thing isn't happening (at least in the clinics I've been to). I waited mine out, but that could've been a dumb decision and something more serious could've been up. Better to be safe than sorry, man.
BabyBumps X First, let me get this out of the way.  Any unprotected contact between you and her of that nature can lead to babies.  Please be smarter in the future, 15 is a little young to be parents.  :)  That said, it is quite likely you are safe.  Not 100% mind you.  If she knows what day her period should start (that can be a problem, youth can make periods irregular to begin with) then you can wait until that day has passed and have her take a pregnancy test if she doesn't get it.  Please keep a few things in mind though. Stress can delay periods.  What causes stress?  Worries about babies.  So, just because her period is late is no reason to think the worst.  You two should relax as much as you are able, and let her body sort things out.    TLDR: If she is late try a pregnancy test.  If it is negative and she is still not had her period a week later try another one.  Otherwise you really don't have many options yet.
BabyBumps X Correct. The one that showed negative the week before we found out was qualitative (the less accurate one). I was actually in the hospital about to be taken back for surgery when the pregnancy showed on a routine urine test. We then ran another qualitative, which confirmed the urine, was discharged/surgery cancelled, and had the OB run a quantitative (more accurate). It was up over 2,700! But it wasn't until the follow-up blood test 4 days later that I really believed it. Kind of hard to deny a 5,000+ HCG. ;)
TwoXChromosomes X It just ended my period and when I did spot it was the week I should have had a period.   Edit: And I'm pretty sure the risk for random spotting is there with any pill...
TwoXChromosomes X This is exactly what happened to me this past month. I started bleeding one week after my normal period ended and have been spotted one month. Yesterday I started heavy bleeding one week before my regular period was supposed to start. I think it might either be my cycle resetting or something to do with seasonal affective disorder.
TwoXChromosomes X This is REALLY COMMON. You must not've read much about birth control before starting. Usually you want to give about three months for your body to kind of "settle" into the pill and then you'll know how you react to it, generally. Every pill affects every woman differently. If it's been about 3 months and nothing is changing, go to your gyno/doctor and tell them you want to try something else out. They'll change your prescription based on the information you give them (you may need a lower dose).  Which pill are you on currently? Just curious.  If you've tried out a few and they're still not working, hormonal treatment may not be your best option.  Discuss this shit with your doctor!
TwoXChromosomes X I was diagnosed with HPV 12 years ago. It was found at my planned parenthood annual visit, and so was stage 2 cervical cancer. I had a cryo (where the dr freezes the cancerous cell off) done. Had to go to the gyn every 3 months for a year. Everything is a ok now. And I went on to have 2 great kids. You will make it thru this. It seems like a lot right now, but it will be ok. Like others have said, if you need to talk with someone, I will gladly be that person. 
BabyBumps X Update- I took 2oz of castor oil at 6pm tonight. I felt the rumblings start within the hour but it never started any real contractions that were any stronger than the ones I have already been having. It did however make my contractions come somewhat regularly. I felt I didn't need a second dose, but by 9:30 I was back to normal. I had hopes that this would work, but my little guy seems to be too comfy to vacate my tum. I go to the doctor tomorrow morning so hopefully I have at least dilated a little.
BabyBumps X I am still feeling plenty of odd twingy feelings, often when I'm leaned over or laying too far over on my side.    With mine, I didn't *really* start to feel the strong definite movements until about 20 weeks or so.  By 24 weeks, I had alien movements (visible movements across tummy).  So I would say that what you are experiencing is pretty normal and give it some time.  You'll be able to tell the difference between the spasms and the movements pretty easily in a few more weeks, I'd say. 
AskWomen X Heating pad, advil, and time.  Buy her some pads if you go to the store, too, cause she may bleed a little.  Mine was terribly painful for a couple days and then it evened out.  
TwoXChromosomes X Take the test in the morning with your first pee of the day. That's when any pregnancy hormones in the urine are at their highest.   If it's still negative, you're probably fine, it's probably stress. 
TwoXChromosomes X That whole TSS thing freaked me out and I would always take it out by or b4 8 hours was up. But one day I forgot and it was like 9hours (tmi, I know I'm sorry) after and I was like oh... I didn't die...
TwoXChromosomes X I don't believe so. I'm on the one with hormones (Minera) and I don't recall hearing anything about that in my (admittedly, not super extensive) research.   It does hurt more to have them put in, and they used to worry about infertility which is why they were hesitate to give them to women who didn't have kids. But other than the hurt-y bit that's no longer the case.
AskWomen X Actually, I haven't had any spotting with an IUD. My periods are like clockwork and I only bleed during them. It did change my fairly comfortable period (mildly sore breasts and very slight nausea the first day was it) to an unpleasant experience for the first year or so (severe cramping for a full week - I'd always kind of thought my best fried in high school had been faking her double-you-over misery, but nope, turns out your uterus *can* be that pissed at you). The cramps started getting better around 6 months and were almost gone after a year. Since then, it's just been one to three days of very mild cramping per period. It does make the flow clottier, though. 
BabyBumps X When my water broke, it was not at all oily. Maybe a little mucousy, from loosing the plug slowly...  If it increases when you lay down (when the baby's head is not plugging up the hole), then it's your waters.
BabyBumps X Your energy will return in a few weeks. I was so exahusted the first trimester. I felt like i needed a mid day nap, one at 6 and then off to bed early. You body is working nonstop building your baby and does zap all your energy. You'll feel like a human again shortly!
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely remember that if you don't want to have a child yet, abortion is a responsible and legitimate way to control your reproduction.  All the shame around it it is bullshit.
TwoXChromosomes X FAM is the Fertility Awareness Method. It involves keep track of your temperature, watching your cervical mucus and movement of the cervix to determine when you ovulate, when you are in a "fertile window" and when you are not.
BabyBumps X everyone is SO different. i freaked out too because i gained 30 lbs by week 25, but i've plateaued and am holding steady at 150. i was underweight to begin with, so my OB has assured me it's OK. still a "small" in maternity pants. and remember, you need fat stores to make breastmilk! just eat healthy and remember to stay active. you'll be fine. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;If the laws were changed such that the fetus was granted personhood, and thus the rights associated with being a person, would your view on abortion change?  No, not at all. I don't care that the law doesn't define the fetus as a person(though it's good that it does, so abortion remains legal), I just don't see at all how the fetus is a person, which makes abortion morally acceptable for me. A fetus possesses pretty much none of the characters that I feel make someone a person.  And having the potential to be a person doesn't grant it the rights of a person in my humble opinion. I have the potential to be president, but I can't stroll up to the White House and demand that they let me into the oval office so I can go about my business.  So if the law changed so that abortion would be killing a "legally-defined" person, I'd still be pro-choice, because I'd disagree with the law.
BabyBumps X I wish I had a bump to show off. I am a big girl, so you can't really see a bump on me yet. I'm still in my pre-pregnancy jeans, and they are still loose on me. :-(
TwoXChromosomes X Yes!  Get first response...also, Amazon sells some very inexpensive 'early detection' tests too. -Detection-Pregnancy-Tests-Pack/dp/B000GHZZOS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325801710&amp;sr=8-1  Those are the ones I used to detect when I was pregnant (I used them about 3-4 days before my period was due and it came up positive, so they do work :)  Good luck love and try not to worry!  (Hugs!!)
BabyBumps X I couldn't express anything, colostrum or milk, the first couple days after my c-section. She was pooping a lot, so I can only assume she was getting something. I just tried to nurse her often and pump when I could, and the milk did come in fine. It's not uncommon.
TwoXChromosomes X as for breastfeeding, 1/3 of women naturally can't breastfeed, and the surgery messes up breastfeeding who can breast feed in about 1/3 of women, so post-surgery you'll have a 1/3 chance to breastfeed as opposed to 2/3. I want children, but not breastfeeding doesn't mean you can't have children. It wasn't that big of a deal for me. DO THE SURGERY!
TwoXChromosomes X Individual items: no age limit.  T-shirts, accessories, cheap cardigans... you can buy that stuff until you're 90 (or beyond!).  Entire outfits from the juniors section worn all together: about 21 or 22.  Especially when you're talking "work clothes."
BabyBumps X She needs to remove the colostrum from her breasts in order to stimulate her milk supply.   It's difficult to remove colostrum with a breastpump, because colostrum is thick, plus there's not really "let down" helping.  Hand expression works really well for colostrum, but you need the technique to get it out: 
TwoXChromosomes X It tends to, yes, but it's not a guaranteed thing. I have the Paragard (copper) and mine hurt less to put in than my girlfriend's did. I've never had children or been pregnant, she has. My cramps and recovery are/were also easier than hers.
TwoXChromosomes X This. No babies (past, present or hopefully future) for me and my Paragard has been a joy. I asked my doctor about it when she told me she needed me to get off the hormones for health reasons, and she agreed straight away. The insertion was easier than everyone made it out to be, but YMMV. For those considering it: Don't let them scare you by saying that it hurts worse for nulliparous ladies. While that may be a good rule of thumb, it's not always the case. My insertion and cramps were/are way easier than my girlfriend's, and she's had a kid!
Parenting X "*Even if they're not having PIV sex*, it's pretty normal for 12-year-olds to be engaging in sexual activity."  Are you still confused?  PIV means "penis-in-vagina."
TwoXChromosomes X If you're on septic, **never** flush anything except human waste (poop, urine, puke), and toilet paper.  **EVER**.    It doesn't break down the same way.  A septic system is designed for the items flushed to break down and reabsorb into the land normally.  A properly designed &amp; maintained system shouldn't ever need to be pumped, either.    As far as the idea of flushing goes, I don't think you're supposed to flush.  These items don't break down the same way toilet paper and human excrement do.  
TwoXChromosomes X In our bathroom, we had recycling (toothpaste boxes, toilet paper rolls, etc.) and garbage. So yeah, I could see him grabbing a toothpaste box. Hell, I've used toilet paper rolls to wrap stuff many a time.
BabyBumps X So after reading your comments, I have to ask, have you had your thyroid checked recently?  I've been hypothyroid since I was young (like 13ish) and it can impact your ability to establish a good milk supply.  Also, if you've always been overweight even with healthy diet and exercise that can be an issue with thyroid problems  A lot of doctors go by old standards for the results so they'll say you're normal but you're not.  Also, a lot of them won't base treatment off symptoms but off of lab results. Anyway, just throwing it out there since it sounds familiar.
TwoXChromosomes X Am I alone in not trusting tampons? I just can never tell when it's time for a new one, and I pee way too often so when I pull it out it's all dry and ick. I've just always preferred pads. They're not that icky if you keep up with them.
Parenting X There is no medical reason to circumcise in the vast majority of cases, and every major medical organization that has a policy paper on the subject agrees. If your boy is an exception to the rule, your doctor will give you a medical reason, after his birth.  Personally, if you live in the US, I'd worry your bundle of joy would be embarrassed to be one of the circumcised boys in the locker room now that circumcision occurs in a minority of male births in American hospitals. 
TwoXChromosomes X The antibiotics kill the good bacteria along with the bad in your gut. When you kill the good bacteria, you are basically giving the yeast a chance to go crazy up in there.  That's why you should eat a lot of yogurt or take acidophilus pills while on the antibiotics (but not at the same time) to replenish the good stuff. 
TwoXChromosomes X I know this is not a popular idea, but I agree. It isn't the government's business to tell others how to run their businesses. I live and work in the US and the men at more than a couple of my jobs are offered paid paternity leave. It is the choice of the employer.   My HS English teacher took paid paternity leave. In the US. Because his employer chose to offer it.   I think unpaid leave should be granted under the Family and Medical Leave Act (which I believe it is). If you can't afford to take the time off, that is a result of poor planning. 
Parenting X There are three people here:  1.  You 2.  Your husband 3.  Your son  This is a permanent, unnecessary, irreversible modification you plan to make to your son's body, *even though he can't express his preference*.  Can you see how appalling that is?  What do you think his vote would be?  Would it to be remove a normal part of his body for no real reason at all?  Also - you don't get a second chance at this, if you cut it off now.  Whereas you can circumcise at any age later on: for medical reasons, for aesthetic reasons, for cultural reasons - but at least *WAIT* until there is a reason that the child is aware of and that is important to them.  If your kid converts to islam or something, then sure, he can choose that for himself (though I hope he won't) but don't choose for him.
BabyBumps X &gt;Plus, pit causes contractions to be painful and longer, which eventually endangers the baby's life, leading to c-section.  I don't know if it's different in the states, maybe the rates are higher, but that's not a fact.  I don't know about the painful, longer part as I haven't had a birth yet without being induced, but both of my induced births were vaginal.  My first birth, the labour was over 24 hours long.  I'm not saying there aren't risks, just wanted to point out that induction doesn't automatically mean c-section like everyone makes it out to be.
BabyBumps X ditto, that's my plan so far. i do trust the doctors to know whats best so if some reason they think i need the pain meds I'll take them but other wise i see no reason not to do it natural. pain is temporary. 
TwoXChromosomes X Hmmm... It doesn't sound like California has a paid maternity leave... It sounds like California allows mothers to go on disability. 
TwoXChromosomes X 22 and this one will be either 23 or 24 depending on when he arrives. His due date is the day before my birthday. 
BabyBumps X It doesn't automatically mean c-section, but the rates are much higher, for several reasons, a large one being impatient doctors.  Plus, yes, longer and stronger. The point of the pitocin is to make the contractions stronger, so even the early contractions most women wouldn't notice them (i slept through mine once, watched two movies through them and was just "uncomfortable, I have a backache that keeps coming and going" the other time.) When you have pitocin they are all pronounced and you get worn out/tired of them faster.  My first (as I said above) was induced and I could clearly feel every contraction for the whole 21 hours. My second was 8 hours from when the "backache" started. Got noticeable after 3 hours. Strong by 5 but was still questioning if I was in labor. In the last 3 hours is when they really hit. My third was similar, but I woke up in the questioning stage... And it lasted, with her, almost 8 hours. The "im I'm in labor, baby is coming today!" Was only 3 hours again. Part of the length is that it wasn't my first anymore... But more than that it was that I was induced with my first when my body wasn't already in labor (commonly done this way) so my body had a lot of work to do to open up.
TwoXChromosomes X If your uterus is tilted, or the placenta is in the wrong spot you can go through an entire pregnancy and not feel kicks.
TwoXChromosomes X Not crazy at all! And they do work awesome.  When I was TTCing I tested super early, like I was only 8 days past ovulation (they usually say not to test until you're 12 days) and I got a positive.. so they work really well.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, we have that... but we also have Paid Family Leave, which women can use for an *additional* six weeks, and fathers can use too. (You can also use it in other cases where you can use FMLA/CFRA leave, like to care for a sick parent or spouse.)
TwoXChromosomes X "Normal Menstruation"  Which happens AFTER ovulation.  If you don't ovulate usually you don't have a period.  Stress and anxiety delay OVULATION.  Not actual BLEEDING.  
BabyBumps X I have a three month old.  I wish that someone had told me:  Breastfeeding HURTS! But, it gets better.  There were times when I would cry everytime I had to feed my son because my nipples were so sore/chapped/bleeding.  Buy lanolin and use it! (but be careful, it can stain your clothes!) By 8 weeks breastfeeding was a breeze, and now I'm so happy I stuck with it! But the first few weeks were really tough.  And: have a pacifier on hand, even if you don't plan to use one.  I was against them from the start, but the first time I drove alone and my son screamed for 20 minutes....oh man, I stopped at Target and bought a pack on my way home.  Trying to drive with him screaming like that....lucky I didn't get in an accident! 
TwoXChromosomes X Are you on any medications where this could be a potential side effect?  I was on a type of birth control pill for a while years ago that was apparently notorious for killing libido (which seems to be completely contrary to the point), but my doctor never told me this and I thought for months there was just something wrong with me.  Finally I went in asking about it, she told me "oh yeah, this one is notorious for that", switched me onto something else, and I was ready to go after that (literally).
TwoXChromosomes X I had those and I was actively trying to get pregnant. It took a First Response Early Result pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy at 7 days late. Those things and their "early result" type didn't pick it up until the next day.
TwoXChromosomes X Mirena's hormones are a lower dosage and also more localized than Depo. As far as I know there are no calcium issues with Mirena. [This study]( ) shows no effect from Implanon on bone density compared to non-hormonal IUD users.   Depo-Provera is a particular synthetic progestrin which can cause bone density loss, Mirena and Implanon contain different synthetic progestrins which don't seem to have this effect. Either of those might be good options for you actually. You should talk to your doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X My birthmother didn't know she was pregnant with me until 8 months along. SURPRISE! She was super athletic and only had her period once or twice a year.  
TwoXChromosomes X They make some very small models (check a comparison chart for the actual sizes), and keep in mind that cups are easier to insert than tampons for a lot of people (like me), because tampons are dry. It's pretty easy to moisten cups with a bit of water (or lube, even), since you're in the bathroom anyway. [Here's the latest comparison chart I could find.]( )  For me, they've been a lifesafer since I can't use tampons, pads and my sensitive skin don't get along, and because I have a very heavy flow. They're not for everyone, but they're definitely the most comfortable alternative I've tried.
BabyBumps X I'm hoping for a shorter labor... My mom had some complications during labor with me, but she was still in labor for about 32 hours. Go figure she gets the doctor that doesn't want to intervene, when she literally can't dilate due to scar tissue and needs the c-section. Of course, if I'm softening my ladybits now, that, in theory, *should* make things progress better when labor does come on. Thanks!
BabyBumps X I just wanted to give a happy story about breastfeeding. I was scared that it was going to be horrible, but my son and I are doing nicely.  He's a month old (today!) and the only issue we had was his hunger before my milk came in. It took almost four days, and the little guy was really hungry and cranky on days three and four, when colostrum just wasn't enough. He was a completely different baby on day five because he wasn't hungry anymore.   But, everything else has been great. I have a few seconds of burning when he initially latches (the let down), but that's it. No cracked nipples, no bleeding. Nothing. I leak like crazy, but it's nothing that nursing pads don't cure. I don't even use nipple cream.  So, there are easy, happy breastfeeding stories, too. My sister, though, who gave birth a few weeks before me, has had the exact opposite experience. She's not producing as much milk, which means her little guy is on the breast a lot more, which means she gets blisters and bleeds. So, while it can go either way, know that sometimes, it can work out just fine and not be a painful experience!  Also, one piece of advice I got was to shoot for six weeks. After six weeks, you can reevaluate and decide if breastfeeding is for you, but it gives you a goal. I've heard the first six weeks are the hardest, so if you make it there, you'll be likely to continue. When I first started (before I knew it was going to be easy for us), I decided I'd go for six weeks. If it worked, then I'd go for six months. If it was still working, I'd go for a year, etc. Now, I'm sure little man and I are in for the long haul. :)
BabyBumps X Some babies won't take to the pacifier no matter how hard you try anyway.  Tried it with my daughter, she wanted nothing to do with it.  Tried it with my son and he'd take it at times, but seems to prefer his thumb.  Even prefers his thumb over the boob sometimes!
TwoXChromosomes X Their Evra patches are the best BC I've used so far but they have a larger dose of estrogen than pills. Different ingredients, of course.
TwoXChromosomes X I've done this a few times so you aren't alone. The last time I was around 10 days late so I went out and bought tests. Got home and went to pee. When I pulled the sick up it was covered in blood. Troll Uterus.
BabyBumps X I guess being in NYC myself, I know how crowded these hospitals are, and for all the other women delivering at the same time, crowded in another wing because someone paid to keep other rooms vacant makes me feel a bit pissed. I researched and found a hospital that I wanted to deliver at.. some OBGYN practices aren't even taking patients with certain due dates because there are already too many.. so what happens when you go to the hospital in labor and end up in the hallway because celebrities wanted privacy? Celebrities should do it at home! Or rent out an adjacent birthing center! 
BabyBumps X If you end up having to have a c-section:   1. You will still have contractions after you give birth. It's normal for your body to do so because your uterus is returning to it's normal size. This hurts a lot.  2. You will bleed A LOT when you first get out of bed after surgery. I'm talking a scary "ON DEAR GOD I"M BLEEDING TO DEATH SOMEONE HELP ME" amount. The nurses just let you bleed on the floor/chair/whatever and it's normal and there is no reason to be alarmed.
TwoXChromosomes X I strongly recommend Paraguard.  I had a lot of problems with hormonal birth control (although OP should be careful about anecdotal evidence ...everyone reacts in different ways!), so I finally got my Paraguard in May of last year.  It's been great ...the only side effect was slightly heavier periods.  However, OP will have to consult with her doctor about whether this is a good choice for her, since it is largely dependent on the size of your uterus, and sometimes women who have not had children may not be able to get it.  (Fyi, I've never had children, but didn't have any problems.)
TwoXChromosomes X I have had my Mirena for a year. I have no children and the insertion process was not that bad for me. The cramping that I had afterward was light to moderate, and my periods have now stopped completely. It has worked wonderfully for me, but it is not for everyone.
TwoXChromosomes X Is there a reason why an ice pack is preferable over a heating pad?  I always use a heating pad to relieve my menstrual icky feelings.  
TwoXChromosomes X Glad it went good for you :) I go for my checkup in a month so hopefully I will be all healed up by then. I also found that the biopsys where super painful... they did about 4 or 5 (over 2 years) before deciding to give me the leep and they where so much worse than the leep itself.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're worried at all, you should go and see a doctor. But! Don't stress about it too much :) I'm 18, and I've been getting my period since I was 8. I have always been extremely irregular, which is both a blessing and a curse. It's great because my periods are so bad that I pass out, throw up, my blood pressure gets dangerously low, and I can't leave the house for around three days -- but it's bad in the sense that I never know when I'll get it! I went on birth control, for hormonal reasons, when I was 14, and it didn't regulate my period at all. It's still very random and I've gone around 8 months without having one. My doctor says it's completely normal.   I'm 5'2" and 100 lbs, so I'm not exactly underweight. I am athletic though, and train every day and compete several times a month, and that can cause irregularity.   Long story short, don't worry about it too much, but definitely make that appointment with your doctor! :)
TwoXChromosomes X I take a daily multivitamin for ladies and a daily calcium/vitamin D/magnesium supplement. The multivitamin helps me feel better and the calcium controls my PMS symptoms. I need to start taking another vitamin D supplement since I can't seem to keep any decent stores of it in my body, and I'm borderline anemic with a red blood cell count that's hinky, so iron is also in my future.
TwoXChromosomes X yea, we're condom people, but every now and again the moment overtakes discretion, i'm looking to use the FAM as more of a backup than my primary BC (condoms!)
TwoXChromosomes X I had no idea that bleeding was unnecessary and that not bleeding was sometimes to be expected until I went on the mini pill and stopped bleeding. I had been told to expect "spotting." I went to the GP, concerned I was pregnant, even though I had no other symptoms.  He explained what was going on. I haven't bled in over a year. It's marvellous. I don't look forward to the time when I come off it for whatever reason (I can't imagine coming off it until I want to get pregnant) and living through periods again :(
Parenting X I do get what you're saying.  I was induced with birth deliveries, so I wouldn't say the second one was any easier, just faster.  But after each delivery was night and day in comparison and I think in part it was because of the epidural.  There was no traumatic pain with my first, things went smoothly and I don't regret anything.  But I think it was a combination of the epidural wearing off and the fact I had stitches so I couldn't really get up, plus a catheter that made things so...not fun that night.
TwoXChromosomes X For me, the insertion hurt, but I was expecting that. What I wasn't expecting was to be in agony for the rest of the day. I was bed-ridden, having the worst cramps I'd ever had, and just a mess for the day. By the next day I was mobile again, and the day after that I was fine. I think my doctor was pretty irresponsible for not warning me that this could happen. I had also ridden my bike to the clinic, and getting home after was not fun, but she never asked how I got there or if I had someone to help me get home.  Menstrual cramps were pretty bad for the first few months, though I could handle them just fine with a couple of tylenol.  Within about six months that went away to. I now get very few cramps (like, literally one or two per period). Despite my experience, I love my IUD and highly recommend it. 
TwoXChromosomes X The OB shape fits me better; even the super absorbent ones are short so I'm not being violated by some super long, super skinny Tampax Pearl.  They expand outwards and just absorb so much better for my heavy period. Plus, they don't itch as much as Kotex or whatever.   You'd think tampons would be the one thing we could all agree on!
TwoXChromosomes X I heard the same.  IUDs can increase the chances of a woman developing Pelvic Inflammtory Disease, so some doctors will refuse to give unmarried women an IUD.  My doctor asked unmarried or significantly long term relationship, which he considered longer than 5 years.  
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks for the concern :).  But I have a crazy history with my menstruation.  Trying a million different birth controls, then not getting my period for a year because I fucked my body up with the hormones, then suddenly bleeding for 5 months straight, then fixing it, and now I have the copper IUD.  It's known for causing heavier flow, so I was expecting that, and I've never in my life had such a regular, reliable period :).  It may be heavy and annoying, but it comes on the right day, leaves on the right day, and I know exactly what's going to happen  when.  I'm healthier down there than I've been in years, haha.
BabyBumps X I think everyone is trying to make this into a natural vs. medicated birth, this is not what I meant. I respect any woman's use of pain medication during a birth, what I don't understand is pitocin and the like. 
BabyBumps X I believe you are right that such procedures are more often than not done for non-medical reasons. However I don't believe that 100% of them are. I believe that there are some circumstances under which it would become actually necessary, however rare they are. And because I don't believe that 100% of interventions are not necessary, I'm keeping my options open for whatever happens and is needed at the time, as much as I want a natural birth. I believe that is what happens when you read about women who have had their birth plans changed.
BabyBumps X I've had a lot more time then you in between c-sections (my daughter is 17 months old), but I'll tell you my fear of something going wrong with my VBAC is still very real to me. Where do you live that they don't allow you to attempt a VBAC after 2 c-sections? No one can really tell you what to do, but I have decided that I'm going to attempt  VBAC. I don't believe my c-section was necessary the first time around, and that I'm a generally good candidate for a VBAC. I am 100% though having a doctor deliver the baby (with a midwife present), and obviously at a hospital in that small chance that something goes wrong. Chances of uterine rapture are small, and I don't think you're midwife would consider letting you attempt one if she thought it was extremely dangerous. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I have always been under the impression that they were separate tests  Which tests are separate?  HPV vs Pap?  I tested positive for HPV from my annual pap.  I'm curious how your HPV wasn't detected with the pap.  Did you have blood work done?  [This page from the National Cancer Institute suggests the guidelines for Pap Smears are different than what you were told/have experienced:]( -test) "Guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that women begin Pap test screening at age 21, be screened every 2 years through age 30, and then be screened every 3 years as long as their last three test results have been normal".  I hope you're having more tested during your annual exam besides chlamydia as there is more to your feminine health besides one STD, such as the health of your cervix (via the pap) and other STDs.  Perhaps that is your doctor's policy as you said.  I've had the opposite experience of you so I don't know if we are going to make any headway haha.  I've always had to "opt in" for STD pannel but Pap Smears were always a given.  Perhaps other 2Xers will chime in or you have some research I could read.
TwoXChromosomes X Another vote to speak with your doctor or a pharmacist.  I don't believe you can just stop what your body is doing and don't think doubling up on the pills is safe.  You may just have to bite the bullet and ride it out :(  As the other ladies have said, you can still get laid, and it'll be just as good if not better!!!  For future reference, I've found it's easier to get my period early than to try to delay it via the pills.  So I'll take my placebo a week or 2 before the week rather than trying to keep taking the hormone pills through the week.  Hope that makes sense.  It allows you to get your period out of the way instead of trying to make it not come.
BabyBumps X sometimes I can just tell how she is. One time she was laying left to right, and I could tell because I found the gap between her head and knees, and besides, she was kicking the right side of my stomach with both feet. Now she's mostly head down, but her feet are constantly trying to dislocate the ribs on my right side, so I'm pretty sure she's angled.   I heard you can use a flashlight to help get them to move around. I keep meaning to try it, but always forget to grab the flashlight before laying down!
TwoXChromosomes X You need to be probed vaginally in order to get a pap smear, and the worst part of it is that they use the speculum to crank you open and then leave you very vulnerable.  Ever tried to remove one of those on your own?  Yes, it @#($U@$ hurts.
TwoXChromosomes X I just want to clarify that to be protected from pregnancy, you need to take at least 21 active pills in a row, and take placebo pills for more than 7 days. If you take less than 21 active pills before taking a break, you need to use backup protection for the first 7 days that you are on active pills again. (Obviously, this is irrelevant if you're not using BC for contraception. I just want to make sure that the OP is aware of this.)
TwoXChromosomes X This worked for friends of mine for several years (they are pregnant now, and I *think* it was planned) ...but personally the thought makes me nervous.  If you want a non-hormonal method, you should consider a copper IUD.
TwoXChromosomes X It's important to remember that ultrasounds are medically necessary to perform abortions. They are used to determine the gestational age of the embryo or fetus--this determines whether a medical abortion is an option or whether 1- or 2-day surgical abortion is necessary. Further, after a medical abortion (which is done in the home) an ultrasound is necessary to confirm the abortion.   In very early stages of pregnancy, transabdominal ultrasound may not be able to locate a fetal picture and/or heartbeat. People with larger body mass can also confound a transabdominal ultrasound in earlier stages. In these cases, transvaginal ultrasounds are utilized.   I think the objectionable part of any ultrasound law is the requirement that a woman see and/or hear the embryo/fetus. The ultrasound itself is medically necessary to performing a safe and successful abortion. My understanding is that, currently, any woman may ask to see or hear if she chooses.
BabyBumps X most employers give 6-8 weeks compensated at some level (60%, 75% salary). you can take up to 3 months but some might be unpaid. 
TwoXChromosomes X But there's no medical purpose to this ultrasound. This is a law requiring an invasive medical procedure not because it's of any benefit to the patient, but to attempt to shame women into not ending a pregnancy.
TwoXChromosomes X Copper IUD's aren't natural, either. Hormones aren't the only reason someone might avoid certain BC methods.
BabyBumps X Yeah! At first you think baby is moving and then you notice he moves at the same place at a rhythmic pace. That's hiccups. I think I started noticing it at the beginning of my first trimester. Noah had A LOT of hiccups. He still does hehe. 
BabyBumps X I've been feeling what I've been thinking are kicks in the same spot at the top left corner of my uterus. I wonder if those had been hiccups the whole time.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;How can you take the placebo pills for more than 7 days though? Aren't there normally only 7?  Sorry, I was using "placebo pills" to refer to any time that you're not taking active pills. The most common way that you might go more than 7 days without active pills is if you miss the very first or very last active pill in your pack. Here's a [link]( ?title=Hormonal_Birth_Control#Am_I_still_protected_from_pregnancy_during_my_hormone-free_week.3F) that has more information.
TwoXChromosomes X A copper IUD might be best; since hormones failed once I'm skeptical of her body's reaction to them.  Paraguard works differently so it might be more effective for the OP.
BabyBumps X It goes both ways.  I chose an epidural for both of my deliveries.  It can be very frustrating to be on r/babybumps and hear from all of the women who have never been through childbirth who say that it's not really painful and that women have been doing it for thousands of years without drugs and that you don't need them.  That can be insulting, too, and I have a feeling many of the people who talk to feel like they're just trying to defend themselves to a person who has never had to experience the pain of childbirth.  There are many women who *do* give birth without pain relief.  Good for them (seriously).  There are also many women who plan on giving birth without pain relief and don't.  They're not failures.  There's nothing wrong with choosing pain relief.
BabyBumps X Birth plan smith plan. I think it's great to have an 'I'd like for it to go this way' idea but babies have plans of their own sometimes.   Boo on your friends for saying it has to be one way or the other. All that matters is that baby arrives safely and Mom is in good health.   Just had an emergency c section on 11-18 to deliver my 10 lb 6 oz baby girl. 
BabyBumps X I didn't drink with either of my pregnancies, but research done in Europe actually has indicated that having a drink a day might lead to more intelligent (!!!) babies.    Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is associated with binge drinking.  Having less than *15 drinks per week* has never been proven to to cause FAS or related effects.  Isn't that crazy?  Studies have shown that having 2-14 drinks per week do not increase the risk of having a FAS baby.  Pregnant women who have 18 drinks per week have about a 1/3 of a chance of having a baby with FAS.    In most countries in the world, it's actually completely acceptable for a pregnant woman to have a beer or a glass of wine.  In the United States, it is recommended that women avoid alcohol completely because there is no known safe amount.  The only way you can be 100% sure that your baby won't have FAS is to not drink at all.  Still, having a single drink really isn't going to cause damage.  With my first pregnancy, my OB-GYN told me to have a glass of wine every night once I was 38 weeks pregnant!  I didn't do it, but that's what she said.  With my second pregnancy, my midwife told me to have a glass of champagne at the weddings I attended.    Anyway, yeah, you always hear that you should never, ever drink during pregnancy, but, in reality, having a single drink doesn't really put your baby at risk.  In fact, there have been some studies done in  Europe that have shown that women who have had 1 drink a day had toddlers who scored better on aptitude tests than toddlers whose mothers completely abstained!    I'm not a doctor or an expert in the field, so don't take what I say to be the word of the Bible.  However, do read up on it, and even ask your OB and midwife.  I can almost guarantee you that what you read will actually surprise you.  Having a beer won't do damage to your bun in your oven :)  Edit:  [an article from 2010]( -drinking-pregnant-women.html)  [another article from 2010.  this one says 1-2 glasses a week is OK]( ,8599,2023984,00.html)  
BabyBumps X In the US, you get 3 months unpaid leave, but only if you've worked at your job for at least 12 months.  Some work places will give their employees paid leave or let them use sick days for some pay, but they don't have to, and many do not.    If the OP tries to find a new job, she will not qualify for leave when her baby is born because she will not have worked for her employer for the minimum 12 months.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;but it's something that needs to be done annually.  [The recommendation in the US is to get pap smears every other year]( ~/media/EC8117ABF5564928A740C4D1B3310E44.ashx), not annually.
BabyBumps X Thanks!  I like to read as much as possible about natural child birth, but I'm not opposed to medical intervention if it is absolutely necessary.
BabyBumps X Ditto. My SO's coworker just got one for her babyshower. I want to ask her how it works but may not get the chance since she is due the end of this month and I'm due in April. I may not see her again before then.
BabyBumps X :) I think this is the problem a lot of women face.. when its doesnt work, they arent prepared mentally to deal with pain managment. Even if you want an epidural, its probably a great idea to puruse relaxation, bradley, hypnobabies for alternative plans. 
BabyBumps X Interesting, I hadn't heard of the hamburger and turtle signs (at least not called that!) but good to know.  They told us at 12 weeks that there was something present on the ultrasound that made them think it might be a boy, but were quick to add that at that point it's impossible to be certain.   So super excited for tomorrow! Excited and impatient. GAH. 
BabyBumps X I'd recommend reading [Taking Charge of Your Fertility]( ). It's about conception and how to recognize when your body is most likely to do it (no, it's not always Day 14), covering a lot of stuff that should be taught in sex ed but isn't. Recognizing these signs your body already makes is called the Fertility Awareness Method. The book has chapters both on how to use FAM to conceive, and how to use FAM as natural birth control. It should be read by anyone with a uterus. Not available on the kindle, probably because of some of its charts and graphics.
TwoXChromosomes X I have had this talk with some of my friends as well and most of them seem to come to the same conclusion but for different reasons.  None of us would want to do it.  I cant imagine the strength it would take to raise a child with that condition, but given the choice, I wouldnt want to find out.  I already know the hardships that the parents have to face and I already know that that child would not have the kind of life that I would want for my children.  It sounds really heartless, but I can always try again.  Im not religious, so I dont believe that I would be killing a soul and I do think that in many ways, its merciful to abort in that kind of case.  I see it sort of like I already have a life that I am capable of enjoying. Although I would love that child, if that child were born, my life wouldnt be kind of life I would want and not the kind of life I would want my child to have. So, to me, it seems like a waste of two lives. Make sense at all? Or do I just sound like a terrible and heartless person?
TwoXChromosomes X A triple test can be performed at week 16-18. After that, you need further testing ( with [amniocentesis]( ) ) to identify the exact problem.  If risks of Down syndrome are higher for some reason, [Chorionic villus sampling]( _villus_sampling) can be performed earlier at about 10-12 weeks of pregnancy.   Tests for a non-invasive but 100% sure diagnosis via free fetal DNA in the mother's blood serum are currently being developed. They could possibly detect Down syndrome by week 8-12. 
TwoXChromosomes X I do not know if I have the lines drawn that clearly, but health of the mother is a necessity (both mental and physical). I'm kind of split on the rest. I can't say I know the damage carrying a child of rape would do to the mother, so it may very well be a necessity. Financial support is more of a convenience, I think. I don't have all the answers and I think a lot of these change on a case-by-case basis. Some people literally couldn't afford a child, for others it'd be extremely hard, but still possible. If I knew the cost of raising a kid I'd be able to answer more accurately. For example, if the kid would prevent me from taking my second vacation each year (and thus is financially unsupportable) I'd place it as a convenience abortion. Comparing that to the family will be starving, then yes it is necessary. Then again, this is only what I hold myself to (if the decision was mine to make) not what I expect out of others. Abort whatever you want, I don't care. 
TwoXChromosomes X If a fetus constitutes human life ( which biology does confirm it ) then there can never be such a thing as "legal, safe abortions". "legal, safe abortions" = destroying human lives. And in many ways, killing a fetus is the most heinous crime one can commit since a fetus is as defenseless and innocent as a human can be.  As I stated before, I used to be pro-choice, so I don't need to get "enlightened". I know all the arguments and they are all bunk. If one takes a moment and actually thinks about the pro-choice arguments, it's laughable. 
TwoXChromosomes X Those blood tests aren't actually diagnostic. They give a probability of Down's based on various markers in the mothers blood when put together with measurements from an ultrasound. If you relied on those tests alone some cases of Down's would be missed and some non-Down's cases aborted. Only CVS and amniocentesis can provide an actual confirmed diagnosis of Down's, you need genetic material from the fetus to show the extra bit of chromosome 21. Just wanted to clarify as this stuff is important (I'm a medical student, can't help myself jumping in especially when it's genetics). 
BabyBumps X I'm not getting an u/s until 20 weeks either and I'm using a midwife. We do dopplar at each visit starting at 12the weeks. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's not something that anyone asks for, not for them or for the child. It's ok to acknowledge that you'd spare not only yourself, but that child from a challenging life, and no guarantee for full and proper care that entire life. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Sorry champ, but nothing you are saying constitutes a "logical scientific argument"  Biology and dna is science last time I checked.   &gt; And you are deciding that women shouldn't have abortions.  I wouldn't be deciding, the law would if abortion was made illegal. Just like the law decided that blacks were human and women were human. Can you imagine a slave owner complaining that abolitionists were trying to decide for him? Or a wife beater complaining that others were trying to decide for him? That's how ridiculous pro-choice arguments are. If a fetus is human, stop killing them.     &gt; By chance, are you a man?  Yes. So what?
TwoXChromosomes X No, not standard at all.  You can elect for 12 week testing, which is blood work and an NT scan, and if you have positive results, a CVS then amnio.  
TwoXChromosomes X No, because if the child is breastfeeding, it means it has been born and can function outside of the womb without obscene amounts of medical care. Therefore, starving an infant is murder. Fetuses are not infants, they are, biologically, parasites feeding off of the host mother. In my opinion, if a fetus can not survive outside of the womb, it is not yet a child. I don't understand where you get the logic for your comparison that if a man can't decide what a woman can do with her own body, he also can't be a gynecologist. That makes no sense whatsoever. Gynecologists are there to ensure the health of a woman's reproductive system- not to control it.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; No, because if the child is breastfeeding, it means it has been born and can function outside of the womb without obscene amounts of medical care.  So a child with cancer that needs obscene amount of medical care is no longer human? That's how you define a human? Medical care? Is that a joke?  &gt; Fetuses are not infants, they are, biologically, parasites feeding off of the host mother.  A fetus is no more a parasite than a breastfeeding infant. And no, a fetus is by DEFINITION not a parasite.   &gt; In my opinion, if a fetus can not survive outside of the womb, it is not yet a child.  A fetus by definition is not a child. Just like a grown man by definition is not a child. What you meant to say is that "if a fetus cannot survive outside of the womb, it is not yet HUMAN". But then like I already stated, then it is simply a matter of medical technology. A 5 month old fetus has successfully survived due to medical technology. -premature-babys-survival-called-a-miracle/49036/  So according to you our humanness is determined by medical progess. A 5 month old fetus is now human, but 20 years ago a 5 month old fetus is not human because the medical technology back then couldn't support a 5 month old fetus. That is nonsense.  Also what if in my opinion, if you can't walk, then you are not human. Does that mean I can go around killing infants? Who cares what your opinion are? If a racist believe blacks are not human, does that make it so? Biology states that human life starts at conception. Biology states that blacks are human. Nobody is interested in your opinion.   &gt;  I don't understand where you get the logic for your comparison that if a man can't decide what a woman can do with her own body, he also can't be a gynecologist.  I don't understand where you get the logic that a man can't decide on the right of abortion just because he can't get pregnant. I was responding to your confused nonsensical implication that only woman should be allowed any opinion on abortion since only woman get pregnant. It's apparent that logic and reason is not the strong suit of the pro-choice lunatics.  
TwoXChromosomes X I've learned that faking it doesn't do anything for me and only strokes the guy's ego; while I keep getting shitty sex. I would highlyy advice experimenting with different positions and also playing with your clit while having sex to try to find different ways to come.  If it's going to be awkward talking about you both receiving pleasure, why are you having sex? Isn't that what sex is all about? 
BabyBumps X A good book to check out is The Complete Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth by Shiela Kitzinger. I'm reading that along with What to Expect and they're both great and informative. :) 
BabyBumps X I've been waking up feeling achy everywhere. First it was my thumbs (weird, right?). Now this morning it feels as though my left hip dislocated itself from it's socket somehow. Obviously this is a good thing for (eventual) delivery, but do I have to go through 4 more weeks of this...!?
TwoXChromosomes X Not exactly. Some women are more prone to weight gain translating into cup gain and some aren't. After gaining 20 lbs in college I went from B to C and after losing 26 I'm back to a B again
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; If life begins at conception, why did you consider the fetus of professor-hot-tit's friend dead?  Because the fetus died many weeks after conception?   &gt; Biology considers that fetus a human life just as much as a single cell zygote. In fact, it must have been a human life for quite a while, despite not having a brain.  Yeah it was human life that experience development difficulties and died. What's your point?  &gt; At what point did the absence of a brain determine that that fetus is no longer human?   You are confusing yourself again. I never said it was not human. I said it WAS human. I said the lack of a brain meant that the human being was pretty much dead. Like if a fetus had development issues with the heart. It was a human being with a tragic development flaw that lead to it's death. THAT'S WHY THEY GAVE IT A BURIAL. Lot's of human beings have developmental problem including missing organs, limbs, etc. So if it wasn't a human baby growing inside of the woman, what was growing inside it? 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Can't (read: shouldn't, I know some who do) wear a tampon at night  Actually, most tampon manufacturers state you can wear tampons at night, so long as you change them at least every 8 hours.
TwoXChromosomes X No.   There is no society in the world that I know of where a woman is looked at as unclean or generally avoided by men if she doesn't get breast implants.   Also, breast implants are, the majority of the time, an alteration entered into by an adult because she, for whatever reason, wants to. I'm assuming you mean 'genital mutilation' as the term is commonly used, meaning things that are done to prepubescent girls, often under pressure from her family and society at large.   And as has been stated, if later labioplasty is done, that is also a choice. Made by an adult. About her own body. I did not have my son circumcised because I felt wrong about permanently altering his body in an unnecessary way without his permission. His fully-informed permission.  So, for me it comes down to that. In that altering the body one way is similar to another, yes, but that's where it ends. No, they are not the same.
TwoXChromosomes X No, sexual harassment is a form of sexual assault, just like verbal abuse is a form of assault. 
TwoXChromosomes X Totally possible to just miss a period because of non-pregnancy reasons. I had a similar situation last year and spent a few days freaking out before I called student health and spoke to a GYN RN. She told me to take a pregnancy test to reassure myself, but it was very unlikely that I was pregnant.  Try to relax. It will be okay.  If you're this freaked out about possibly being pregnant, I would recommend a more reliable form of backup BC. If a condom is your primary line of defense and the rhythm method is your backup, be aware that it's easy to mess up the rhythm method - especially if your body is reacting to Plan B and the stress of you thinking your pregnant. Pleasepleaseplease consider hormonal contraceptives! It will take a huge weight off your shoulders!
BabyBumps X I had both vaginal with no meds and a planned c-section. I was so exhausted with v birth, like REALLY tired- so much so it took away from the bonding experience in the hospital because I just wanted to sleep (this was also after weeks of not sleeping well due to being so uncomfortable at the end). After the C-section birth I was bright and alert...but I cried a lot- I think it had to do with my body not going through the natural process to bring on the baby.
BabyBumps X No way, if I go full term I would never give up my child. I'm not at all uncomfortable with abortion, it's only tough to make a decision because we both really do want a baby - just thought it wouldn't be for a couple more years.
TwoXChromosomes X And then we have massive overpopulation, because no babies would ever be aborted, and you'd be left with a ton of unwanted children being raised incorrectly and becoming a drain on society (possibly also a higher number of unwanted children with developmental defects who were relocated to a synthetic uterus before they would have been a miscarriage). You have to protect a woman's right to choose to not bring a baby into the world at all for the sake of the rest of the population. Especially if the fetus is at the point where it would only survive with extreme medical intervention (i.e. synthetic uteri), a woman should still have the right to choose to just terminate the pregnancy instead of transplanting it.  I'm sort of confused about your last point. Did you mean to say that someone who didn't know they were pregnant until they were 38 weeks along shouldn't be able to abort at that point? The wording made it sound like the opposite... If you were 38 weeks along you'd already be full term, so obviously if you took the baby out and killed it, that would be killing an actual baby and not a bundle of cells, or partially-formed fetus. But that's incredibly different from having an abortion at even 15 weeks into the pregnancy. Anything before 22 weeks is currently not an "autonomous life" by any stretch, because it would literally die if it wasn't parasitizing off its mother. That's not killing a baby, it's killing a fetus or embryo that can't feel or think.
TwoXChromosomes X You wouldn't, but would a workplace?   One definition of sexual harassment: "Sexual Harassment can be defined as any unwelcome verbal or non-verbal sexual advance, requests for sexual favors, other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, and/or conduct directed at an individual(s) because of gender."  One example of sexual harassment in that same policy: "Inappropriate and unwelcome physical contact such as touching, patting, pinching, hugging or other sexually suggestive contact."
TwoXChromosomes X thanks :) It's just weirded me out that my period completely stopped just 1 day after taking my first pill :/ I'm looking forward to regular periods though. I currently live in a world in which my "period is coming" symptoms last for more than 2-3 weeks before bleeding actually starts so I'm paranoid for weeks on end.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on Seasonale for about 5 months, and then I had a 65 day period, and then went off Seasonale because I was sick of being on my period for life.
BabyBumps X I haven't seen/felt anything external yet (only 17+1), but the squirmy wormy feeling is weird enough.  Also - bellybutton kicks from the inside- urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
BabyBumps X At 2 weeks it's way too early to think about doing anything other than making healthy eating choices.  Listen to your hunger and eat, though.   I ate a ton more after my son was born than when I was pregnant, and I wasn't expecting that to be the case (but I now know breastfeeding uses more calories than being pregnant).  I lost all my baby weight (and I gained 40 pounds when I was pregnant!) effortlessly.  Not sure why I was so worried.   At 2 weeks, though, my stomach was quite scary looking and depressing.  Try not to think about it so much right now.  Have you weighed yourself recently?  That helped me feel better, I was down 20 pounds within the first few weeks.  
BabyBumps X Oh darling. When I was pregnant with my first I weighed 250 pounds (not ashamed to say it.) I began to look pregnant around 17 weeks. And by time I was 26 weeks people were NOT thinking I was just fat. No matter how big you are (unless you're 450lbs+ sorry to say..) People will not just think you're fat. You will be noticably pregnant. 's me at 27 weeks. To me I don't think I just looked fat. Sure, you could tell that I was overweight, but you could also tell I was pregnant. That baby bump will pop up :3 don't you worry!
BabyBumps X They didn't know why she wasn't progressing really. My ob didn't really think she was more than 8.5 or 9lbs at the most. They put an internal monitor in around 13hrs of contractions every 2-4mins and they were adequate so they tried the oxytocin to see if they could get her moving but it didn't work. I pretty much knew that it wasn't progressing and just had this gut feeling it was going to end the way it did. I was nervous about surgery but I have to say it really wasn't bad for me. I only took Motrin for maybe 2-3 weeks; never needed anything stronger.   Anyway- after a few hours of oxytocin she still didn't move and I had gotten a placenta infection from being checked and the meconium so they wanted to get her out. When my ob first saw her head she started going on about how big her head was and then that she was massive. :) I didn't get to see her right then because she was sick but when I did I was in shock at the size of her.   I, like you, hoped to have a vaginal birth, I even wanted to have the most natural that I could. Three weeks before I had her I got bells palsy, so the puking was harder on me than usual. Talking was difficult so throwing up was just the worst that day.   Being mentally prepared for anything is a really good idea. 
TwoXChromosomes X I also had a period for the entire 3 months I was on depo. They even gave me extra progestin to try to stop it, but nothing would stem the tides. I gave up after the first shot and went back on the pill.
BabyBumps X If she took the morning after pill I wouldn't worry. Her period might just be late due to the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. It happened to me once when I was worried I was pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you talked to your gyno about these symptoms? If you haven't I think you should.  Diarrhea isn't uncommon, or so my gyno assures me. Something to do with the hormonal changes, but it sounds like hormones are are doing a few extra loopy-loops.
TwoXChromosomes X Ask about the Mirena IUD, the hormones are local and for most women their periods become lighter (or stop altogether). It stays in for about 5 years but if it doesn't help you can always get it removed.
BabyBumps X During my first pregnancy, I started off at about 200lbs, I lost about 35 in the first 3months ( sickness + change in appetite), then put on about 10lbs in the last few months of pregnacy.  My daughter was born a bit early, and weighed just over 5lbs, and then taking into account the weight of the placenta and the extra blood and fluids, I ended my pregnancy about 40lbs lighter than before!   Eat well balanced meals and you may lose weight. You will grow a bump soon, and when you do you will feel awesome! 
BabyBumps X that's exciting! i'm at 21 weeks, and can feel her moving sometimes. can't wait!
TwoXChromosomes X Only no other 'parasite' has the 100% probability to develop into a fully functional human being in a very short time. As someone who is generally pro-life but with understanding that not everything is black and white, it is arguments like this that honestly make me sick.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Not nearly a 100% probability actually, it's actually really unlikely that most blastocyst will implant properly, over 50% fail to implant. Then there's the chance that it will not be a 100% functional human being. 2 of my sisters are autistic, my friend has spina bifida, and my high school had over 300 severely disabled 'students' who were able to do nothing but sit in their wheelchairs and drool.   I did mean a fetus that is already implanted and is developing, because if it hasn't implanted no abortion would be needed, so it wouldn't even be a question. Autistic people are still fully functional people, they just function differently from 'the norm', most of us are abnormal in some way, some more so than others. People with disabilities are still 100% people.  &gt;Also, according to the true definition of parasites, that is exactly what an embryo is, "An organism that lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host's expense."  &gt;It's a true, if uncomfortable, statement.   But it is language like this that is one of the reasons abortions are so common, as I said in my reply to this thread I think people need to be re-educated with regards to this.   For example us humans are mammals, but if you put all the emphasis on us being mammals rather than us being *humans* anything that other mammals do would be seen as ok for us to do - whether it is eating your own poop, throwing it at others, sniffing butts as a greeting and whatever other behaviors you can think of that are completely inappropriate for human beings to engage in.   Yes a fetus is an organism that lives in its *mother* (not just a host) for a short while and completely depends on her for nutrients. But unlike any other 'parasite' a fetus has a set time that it will spend in its "host's" body after which it will be *born* and it is also directly related to the host. It is not a foreign species that enters your organism and benefits from it and has *its* offspring while there.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I am in bed with the heating pad on my stomach, covered by the laptop.  Sorry for the off-topic, but laptop on top of the heating pad? I am cringing for your laptop. 
Parenting X A lot of places like you to have a full bladders when getting the ultrasound done to get better pictures and measurements.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't understand why your doctor doesn't want you to have the Mirena, but says the Paragard is ok. What is the reasoning behind this?  I think you should try to get a Mirena rather than Paragard. Ask your doctor again or go elsewhere if you have to, but since you seem to do well with hormones, I wouldn't really recommend the Paragard because it makes your period pretty hellish. I've had mine for 3 months and the cramps are not fun. To me, it's worth it because I don't like being on hormones. But, if I did well with the pill, I would totally get the Mirena. It usually makes your period stop altogether.
BabyBumps X If you're having pains at 31 weeks, get a check up, it won't do any harm. It's probably nothing at all. When the time comes, when the contractions et strong enough to be something to worry about you will know all about it!! 
BabyBumps X I'm 3 months in and it's just starting to be not be as bad. I would puke at the stupidest smells lol now I still dry heave but I can control not puking. Still waiting for it to get easier but I haven't thrown up in a while.
BabyBumps X From the time I felt they were "painful" and regular...about 9 or 10 hours, including 1.5 hours of pushing. By the time I felt them, they were about 12 minutes apart and causing enough discomfort to not be able to sleep - maybe a 5 on a 10 point scale. I labored for a few hours on my own (let my husband sleep since we had an hour drive to the hospital) and woke him up to get ready to go when I was 7-10 minutes apart. A little over an hour later I was 2-3 minutes apart and was not expecting to go that fast. Some time in that hour it went to the "this is pretty painful" level - like a 8/10. The car ride was the worst part because at that point I was also feeling a ton of pressure. I was 8.5 cm when I got to the hospital, but didn't deliver for almost 4 hours after check in because my daughter we still very high up.  I had read that sometimes your labor can go much like your mother's labor. For me, that was true. My mom had a relatively fast first (and only) labor. Maybe ask your mom what her experience(s) were like?
TwoXChromosomes X [Pelvic]( -topics/womens-health/pelvic-exam-4306.htm). [Pap]( -topics/womens-health/pap-tests-hpv-tests-19875.htm).  Typically the exam may be uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful (pain can be a sign of a pelvic pain disorder, an infection, or a doctor who is an asshole). It's easier said than done, but relaxing will help make it less uncomfortable. If you feel pain, tell your doctor. A decent doctor will either stop what they're doing or try to be more gentle.
BabyBumps X At 15 weeks, I think all I wanted to do was sleep... Nesting never actually hit for me, and now all I want to do is sleep again.  Your baby is very lucky!
TwoXChromosomes X While I understand that bathrooms are a bit ew to breastfeed, I truly do not understand why it's such a problem to either discretely cover up, or use a breast pump at home and then bottle feed when in public.  But mostly, I feel the whole breastfeeding thing has become a political agenda, and I do not feel that that agenda should be fought out in what's supposed to be a *fun, education show for toddlers*.
TwoXChromosomes X Pads feel disgusting to me. Even wearing a pad for an hr ( and im not a heavy bleeder) makes me feel like there is a muggy swamp down there.  I can also smell the period smell when I use a pad. when I use a tampon I don't.   tampons allows me to put it in, and forget about it for a couple hours. With pads Im self conscious of everything when I'm wearing one ,which doesnt help my anxiety at all.
TwoXChromosomes X Some doctor may give you an IUD.  For some reason they don't like to give them to young women.  They say that if you have an IUD it increases your chance of getting PID if you get an STI, but even if your chances are doubled, the numerical chances are still very low of it happening with an IUD, *if* you manage to get an STI (wear condoms anyway, unless you are in an LTR and the other person has been tested [and is trust-worthy])  Hormonal IUDs also don't cause bone-loss, like some doctor tried to tell me.  IUDs can last at least 5 years, and the hormonal ones basically get rid of your period.  One study said it was more effective than tying your tubes.  It's a very small amount of hormone just in your uterus, so it is not likely to cause side-effects.  The insertion hurts, but is not difficult or lengthy.  If for some reason you ever want to have children, you take it out, and you're immediately good to go.  If your doctor refuses to give you one, tell them you are an adult, and can make your own choices about your body: IUD is not more dangerous than other types of birth control, and it will not be any more harmful for a 19 y.o. than the 25+ year olds that they usually put them in. It hurts more to get it put in if you haven't have children, but you're a big girl: you can handle it.  They may grudgingly get one put in, or at least refer you to someone who will prescribe it
BabyBumps X I had subchorionic bleeding when I was about 6-7 wks along. Had a blood test &amp; ultrasound done - everything looked fine. There was lots of blood, but didn't last longer than a day and never returned at that level again (only occasional spotting). I'm hoping it turns out to be the same for you. Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X Some doctors will be reluctant to give childless women IUD's, but there really is no real reason not to. The only thing is that the insertion might be more unpleasant if you never had kids...  I'd just call your doctor's office and ask right off if he'd give you and IUD at your age. If not, just call up doctors until you find one who will.
TwoXChromosomes X For me it's the opposite. Tampons = excessive bleeding, heavier and longer periods, and worse cramps. Pads = quick, easy, painless, lighter period. Everyone is different!
TwoXChromosomes X I have the paragard.  Pros:  *  No hormones * Lasts up to 10 years * Doesn't make me cramp any worse than I already did * Don't feel like the psychopath I felt like on hormonal BC * Highly effective * Insertion was quick and didn't bother me really  Cons:  * First week or so I did cramp a bit more than normal and spotted  * My periods are ~1-2 days longer      
TwoXChromosomes X I've cut the stem off my cup because it poked me.  Even with the smooth bottom, it's really easy to remove - just pinch the bottom slightly, rock it from side to side and gently pull it out.  The first few times I did it in the shower because I thought it would be a freakish mess, but I'm surprised at how clean it is!  The bottom of the cup (where you have to handle it) stays clean and everything just sits on the inside.
TwoXChromosomes X I loathe tampons and the way they feel. I hate the feel of the cotton. And I can't even feel my diva--I have even forgotten I had it in a few times. And I recently tried the soft cups when I didn't have access to my diva, and I couldn't feel those either!   It seriously changed my life to have a comfortable, internal option.
TwoXChromosomes X That isn't going to happen.  You squeeze to break the seal and pressure.   If you don't break the seal you can't really pull it out, it hurts and the angle makes it difficult to pull with enough force, so you would have to be pretty fucking stupid and brawny to yank anyway.  Even if you *did* yank anyway and get it out, there isn't that level of pressure. It sits behind your cervix, which is quite rigid and has a tiny hole too small for it to just be pulled out like that. Just feel up your cervix now, you should see what I mean.  And if that's not convincing enough you're actually being told right now by a bunch of women that they use menstrual cups and IUDs and it's fine. And it's not the sort of thing that can pull out a little bit each time as it would be majorly uncomfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X As they are non absorbent there should be a lower risk of infection than with tampons, assuming you clean and store them appropriately. You can either boil them or use sterilising tablets before the start of the next cycle.  I either wipe with toilet paper or rinse under a tap between uses and wash at the end of my cycle and then sterilise it shortly before I expect to use it again, rather than sterilise and then leave it sitting around.  Also they are safe to use before you start bleeding if you are expecting your period and have to go out or some such.
TwoXChromosomes X Does anyone know if you can have a Diva Cup and a NuvaRing in your vagina at the same time?   I would love to switch to the cup, because my periods are really heavy the first few days and I usually end up changing the super absorbent tampons every hour or so. Would love to not do that anymore.  I also tried the Diva Cup a few years ago, and it just woud not go in. I tried for hours (collectively, not all at once), and could not do it.
TwoXChromosomes X U by kotex lightest panty liners, sooo thin you cant even feel them and super flexable you can even wear them on a thong, and they come in pretty wrappers :) I love them.
TwoXChromosomes X What great ideas! I could just take it out in the shower until I get used to it (and probably continue to do so after, because that sounds incredibly convenient). I didn't realize there were so many different brands. Getting started on disposable ones doesn't sound as daunting as buying one that lasts &gt; 1 yr.   I was worried about having to fold it into a "V" if it was too full and have everything gush out because the first day or two are really heavy for me =X But if I start off by changing it in the shower and/or change it more frequently, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.     Thank you so much for the advice!!  =)
BabyBumps X Of the people I know who got pregnant while taking the pill, they both did not take it properly.  The took it ad different times, missed days, etc.  I do know of one lady who got pregnant on the low dose pill even while taking it faithfully so it does happen.  Just not really very often from what I understand.
TwoXChromosomes X [Details about a pelvic]( -topics/womens-health/pelvic-exam-4306.htm). [Details about a pap]( -topics/womens-health/pap-tests-hpv-tests-19875.htm).  Typically the exam may be uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful (pain can be a sign of a pelvic pain disorder, an infection, or a doctor who is an asshole). It's easier said than done, but relaxing will help make it less uncomfortable. If you feel pain, tell your doctor. A decent doctor will either stop what they're doing or try to be more gentle.
TwoXChromosomes X I switched to a meluna for just that reason. It's a much shorter cup and you can get it with a little ball instead of the stem. It sits low and comfortably. I can't feel it at all.
TwoXChromosomes X I read the turning thing in the instructions but I've never managed to turn it.  If it doesn't feel right I'll run a finger around the outside to make sure its properly "inflated".  
TwoXChromosomes X I've tried the Instead cups, and they're a lot bigger in circumference than your "typical" menstrual cup (which I've seen but never used), so they're actually a lot harder to get up there properly, and can be a little uncomfortable if it's not seated.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using the diva cup for about a year now, it took me like 3 or 4 periods (where I used it once or twice) before I actually got it to work the way it's supposed to work. So it definitely takes some getting used to, but I'm probably never going back to tampons :P. Sometimes I do use a tampon out of lazyness, but to be honest, tampons are grosser than the cup (unless you can't stand the sight of blood). 
TwoXChromosomes X Also try a tampon without an applicator attached to it. May help.   Feel with your finger first what direction the tampon should go / in what direction you should push it. There is an upward curve (upward when lying on our back) in your vaginal canal, at least that's my prediction.   Your symptoms may be from mild vaginismus as well, which means pain when inserting an object in your vagina. 
TwoXChromosomes X Blame the whole Abstinance-Only bullshit education the republicans keep pushing. If we want teens to stop getting pregnant or STDs, PROPER sex ed needs to be taught. 
BabyBumps X The first major (i.e. standard) ultrasound that's are done early in pregnancy is the [N/T scan]( ), which has to be done between 11 and 13 weeks. Past 13 weeks is too late. It's used to screen for Down's but other problems can be detected at this point.  The second standard u/s that's done is the [anatomy scan]( -health/prenatal-testing/ultrasound-anatomy-two.aspx) and that's done between 18 and 22 weeks. You find out the sex, if you want, at this appointment  I got an u/s at 8 weeks to date my pregnancy (i.e. confirm that the gestational age so they can schedule the 11-13 week correctly) but not all doctors do that. But they should have at least offered you the N/T scan between 11 and 13 weeks even without dating, I thought that was standard care.  
BabyBumps X Same here! By this time next week (my appt is Friday morning) I'm hoping we'll know the sex!
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks! I do loooove cute stuff. I have piles of it. Cute stuff is like a drug, once you get a taste... buy ALL the things. Thanks for checking in again, and thanks for the tips!
TwoXChromosomes X What do you mean you're "careless"? Do you mean that you don't use condoms, or that sometimes you take your pill late?  Anyway, this is not that uncommon. I've been on my current pill for almost a year, and I still have spotting occasionally. There are many reasons that your bleeding may start earlier. Stress, weight loss/gain, change in exercise habits, illness, taking a pill late, missing a pill...all these things can affect your period, even when you're on the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;A fetus, if left to grow, will become a person and so by killing a fetus you are depriving that human of their right to life.  Actually, no. Half of all pregnancies naturally miscarry with no outside interference. Particularly if a woman aborts before the end of the first trimester (when most miscarriages happen), she's really just making sure she is no longer pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X It was your off-week in that you were supposed to be on your period but were not? My pharmacist informed me that with the off-week of daily birth control you will start bleeding when you become fertile. If you're not on your period during your off week, then the hormones you've been taking over the last month have been building up to make you safe for the week until you start taking again. 
TwoXChromosomes X I hate when people talk about abortion in terms of "convenience". There is no such thing as an abortion out of "convenience". An abortion by nature is not convenient. Women have *many many reasons* for getting abortions. You know what a damn good reason is? PREGNANCY is dangerous - a woman shouldn't have to be required to put her body through that. That is not an abortion out of "convenience". That is an abortion with a legitimate reason.
BabyBumps X I said this (was actually true in my case) and they try and get you to say a rough date, which i did and they marked me at 12 weeks (would be 17 weeks today), but when they did my u/s a week ago they dated at 12 (so 13 weeks today) and they changed all my notes to match.  So i guess what my point is that yes they do can the dates (to OP), and mine was 4 weeks out to start! At such an early stage they will be only estimating anyway, everyone's cycles are different. Good luck :)
BabyBumps X Not true with all doctors. My midwife and both doctors I had in the past go on LMP only unless there's a reason for an early ultrasound, and unless the 20 week ultrasound shows baby WAY off from 20 weeks, they won't change it.
BabyBumps X Sorry you're gong through this. We're waiting for our test results to come back (it's been a week and a half!) My ob said the false positives correspond to age with false positives increasing with maternal age. Testing at the wrong time can also bring issues. Sorry you're going through this!
BabyBumps X My tests gave me screen positive with probability of 1:57. Had an amnio, baby girl is fine. Lots of worry though. If it gives you peace of mind, have the amnio. The anatomy scan can sometimes tell, too. But it sounds like you wouldn't terminate with a positive, so you might not want to risk the slight miscarriage risk.
BabyBumps X I'm actually not doing most of the screening due to timing and such. I tried to get in for a nuchal scan U/S but my ideal time period was just before Christmas and in the period between Christmas and New Years. I'd decided too late to get it done, was travelling, and couldn't find a place that could either do the scan or had an open appointment. (And Hartford Hospital screwed me by not calling me back).  Ahem.  We had wanted to screen in order to have a good idea if we needed to prep for the baby and build up a network of doctors who could help us keep a child with a genetic disease healthy. We had decided that we weren't going to abort in nearly any scenario (no viability being an exception).  But since we're not doing anything, I'm just taking everything as it comes. The tests only give you an idea of your chances. They can't be super accurate. Even a 1 in 4 chance means there are three kiddos who come out perfectly healthy. It's all in how you trust the statistics. And I don't want to worry if there's a false positive. So... not testing. And if it happens, it happens.
BabyBumps X My boobs were only sore from 5-7 weeks, but I'm still battling nausea now and then, which came on around 7 weeks. but even having had an ultrasound at 8 weeks which showed the hearbeat, and hearing the heartbeat at 12 weeks, sometimes I still don't believe it. I'm pretty sure it's perfectly normal to wonder if you're really pregnant, even after multiple confirmations. if you're not cramping or bleeding, all is probably well! and even if you, all might still be well. hopefully your doctor/midwife will let you hear the heartbeat in a couple more weeks if you can't get an ultrasound! good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds painful! My tip would be to use lube that does not contain glycerin (can cause yeast infections) or propylene glycol (petrochemical used in antifreeze!)  Be careful b/c even lubes that claim to be natural or organic can have those ingredients. I really like Oceanus Naturals warming lube. $11 including shipping for 4 oz. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Your situation sounds so similar to mine! Maybe its yeast infection? when i get a yeast infection, its super painful during sex. Also, the bacteria could still be on your boyfriends junk cause it just kinda lives everywhere.   Yeast infections are not caused by bacteria.
BabyBumps X I think it depends on how old you are, are you high risk, will you terminate if it's positive. I started them &amp; it ended up stressing me out so much I'm not going to do the last of the blood work. I am 24, not high risk, and I wouldn't terminate and to be honest I have read SO many cases where they give false positives, Then you have to go in for an amino and thats a risk all for what? i think if its a super big deal to you, it special needs children run in your family, maybe. But i felt totally pressured by my Doctor to do the tests and looking back i wish i never started it.  
Parenting X Your son has already gotten all of the benefits from breastfeeding since he's already 8 months.  Have you started him on solids yet?  Does he drink anything other than breastmilk?  Start gradual and slowly work breastfeeding out of your routine.  By the time I had gone back to work when my daughter was 9 months, she was mostly eating baby food, drinking that baby apple juice you can get and I believe regular milk.  So nursing her after work lasted for only about a month.  It was a natural decline and we just eventually fell out of the habit and routine of it.
TwoXChromosomes X There's a few ways this could branch out, where it's either one, some, or all.  Vaginismus is an involuntary spasming of the pelvic floor muscles.  It can be so tight that it's nearly impossible to penetrate.  Based on what you've described, this is what I'd look into first.  The most common forms of treatment are either a self-treatment plan or working with a physical therapist who specializes in the pelvic floor.  I personally had great results with the PT.  Vulvodynia is the term for generalized vulvar pain.  I have/had both this and vaginismus.  (For me, the vulvodynia causes the vaginismus.)  Meidicine-based treatments for this vary, like certain anti-depressants or Botox.  And some of vulvodynia, at least for me, is breaking out of the cycle of anticipating pain, and making sure I'm in the right "mode."  I got really lucky.  By the time I went searching for an answer, I'd been reassigned to a new, awesome gyno who took my issues seriously.  I would try and get a referral to a pelvic pain specialist.  They're the most likely to listen.
TwoXChromosomes X Ahh, well, obviously, you'd need to discuss it with your doctor (and most won't let you have one if you haven't had kids yet, anyway), but don't be afraid - perforation is pretty rare. The IUD itself is super tiny, and as long as it's inserted correctly, you'd very likely be completely fine. And the benefits (for me) far, far, faaaar outweighed any possible risks. I've tried approximately one metric fuckton of different birth control methods, and the IUD is the only one I've so far ever been completely satisfied with.    But either way - I'd shy away from the shot in your situation, too (it did all kinds of weird things to me, and I have always had fairly "normal" periods), but would definitely talk to my doctor about adjusting my pill dosage or trying a different kind, to see if you can't calm your periods down that way. From my understanding, you should be able to stack with relatively no problem if your pills are the right dosage/kind for your body. My sister has terrible periods, as well, and had to try several different pills before she found one that worked well for her.
BabyBumps X It depends on your philosophy about the whole thing, really.  If you would rather know all about labor and birth, what to expect, techniques to cope with pain (that aren't narcotics/drugs), and you want to know all of your options for care in the hospital for you and your baby, take a class.  If you want to take a back seat, trust your doctor, and deal with things as they come, then you probably don't NEED a class.  I took Bradley Method classes, and we'll see how I do in labor, I guess. I'm the type that wanted to know everything about the labor process, hospital procedures during birth, what is/is not normal, etc. I did a lottt of research myself, but the classes helped me (and my husband) get really comfortable with the idea of birth and what to expect.
BabyBumps X I am having a blood screening done and a u/s where they will look closely at the baby to look for any problems, this is mainly because I have a disorder called Neurofibromatosis and my OB doesn't know much about it and she wants to be on the safe side. We elected NOT to have an amnio bc of the risk involved. Plus, I have a scar on my leg from when my mom had one and the needle went through my leg. We won't terminate the pregnancy but we want to be as prepared as possible for when the baby comes.  
BabyBumps X Make sure to check where you're giving birth. My birthing center won't accept patients unless they have taken a class (any type of class, but some birthing class). I didn't want to take a class, but now I'm enrolled to start a Bradley class in february...
TwoXChromosomes X I already do this, and no dice. This horrific contraction-laden period IS my breakthrough bleeding. Thankfully my breakthroughs only last 9 days, as compared to the 12 day bloodbaths I used to experience. I've had many exams on my body for other reasons, and do have PCOS, but no other issues. No hysterectomies, though- I want to have several kids, so I won't consider it for a long time. Thanks though!
BabyBumps X I get kicked in the crotch a lot these days.  It's hard to tell if it's my cervix, bladder, or some combination of whatever nerves are down there.  Sometimes it's just one or two and sometimes she's doing a full on dance recital.  When that happens, the only thing that helps is laying down on my side with a pillow under my tummy and behind my back.  
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, if she was interested she could get Adiana or Essure (non-surgical sterilization), tubal ligation, or maybe a bilateral salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes). But it's almost impossible to get a hysterectomy that isn't medically necessary.  Insurance coverage would depend on the company and plan for any of those. Which is to say, it's a crap-shoot much of the time.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; That the life of the potential person trumps the 9 month period of non-self-governed life required by the pregnant mother.  To me, both sides of the abortion argument value life. One values *quality* of like; the other, *quantity* of life.  
TwoXChromosomes X I'm going to have to remember to look this up when I'm at an actual computer, but this problem has been proven several times.  The worse the sex education is in an area, the higher the rate of unplanned and teen pregnancies.  We live in an age where the choice to have sex and the choice to get pregnant can very easily and almost always be two completely separate choices, **provided there's access to education about it**.  Condoms, for instance, can be just as effective as other forms of birth control, provided they're used correctly.  Used incorrectly, they're somewhere around 80% effective.  I'm not going to pretend I understand the mentality that leads to restricting sex education, but one of the biggest effects of it is turning back the clock on the advantages that give us all access to better choices.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, I can see that if we are talking about parasites, or as you say, an adult that wants to live off my body. Yes, I'm not legally obligated to feed him and take all the risks.   But we are not talking about parasites or adults here. We are talking about human beings in formation that we created by having sex. They were created as a consequence of my acts, so I should be responsible for them, including the risk involved. They didn't decide to come here and feed off my body. They had no decision in the process, the only ones responsible for that are the parents, both of them. The way I see it, if I conceive a baby, whether I want to raise it or not, his/her right of life is above all else. It would be extremely selfish to end somebody else life just because I don't want to be responsible for the process I started in the first place.  I say this as an atheist male who is pro abortion only in extreme cases (risk of death, rape or extreme mental retardation)
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using the NuvaRing and DivaCup since I was 19, and I'm now in my mid-20s.  I cannot feel a NuvaRing or DivaCup inside me, and have no problems inserting them.  But I also find Insteads really uncomfortable.
BabyBumps X Yeah, I saw that right after I posted!  And same here about the cramping-- I panic for a second, then calm down. I would definitely mention it to your doctor if it's worrying you though. I'm tending to worry more about things that aren't really a big deal too since it's my first also. Hang in there :)
TwoXChromosomes X 60% of all pregnancies are naturally terminated by body. only 4 out of 10 actually beat the odds and become a life. 6 out of 10 pregnancies are a clump of cells.
BabyBumps X Check out any Bradley method classes in your area. My cousin, who has had all 3 of her children at home, naturally, highly recommends them. I will be having mine, naturally, in a birthing center. I plan on checking out some Bradley classes once we get closer (only 16 weeks, we have time:)
TwoXChromosomes X I'm trying to find it, but I recently read an interesting discussion about how the pro-life movement's name, by default, implies that. the opposing movement must be 'anti-life,' which is, of course, not at all what the pro-choice movement is.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I've heard that it's normal, but what is the normal amount of white(ish) discharge in between periods?  It varies, but as long as it doesn't smell bad (fishy) and there's no pain, you're generally all right.  If you think it's messy or thick, panty liners are very convenient to keep things feeling dry.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; So, how do you make careless people responsible for their actions without forcing them to ruin their lives by having a child?   You don't.  Just because you personally feel they should be responsible doesn't mean you should force them to be responsible.  Birth control is the best way to avoid unwanted pregnancies, which requires proper sex education to teach people how to avoid unwanted pregnancies.
TwoXChromosomes X Do they happen that fast? Last month was just basically a regular period month, very little trouble with cramps at all. This month is hell. 
BabyBumps X I checked on mine as well. This is part of why I decided almost right away that I preferred to give birth in a hospital rather than a birthing center. There's every indication that my baby is healthy, but I'd still rather be in an environment that is prepared for the worst. I'm glad for those who choosing birthing centers or even home births and have wonderful experiences there, but my personal preference is for a hospital.
BabyBumps X I was strep positive but I'll be honest, I can't remember if it was Group B. Anyway, I wanted natural labor (as natural as possible) but ended up not only with the iv for antibiotics but also with pitocin. I had gestational diabetes and the little bugger wouldn't come out. They were worried he'd get too big for me to deliver so I was induced. I still made it through with no other meds. Just be as natural as you can.
TwoXChromosomes X He does not "support abortion" - he supports the availability of safe abortions. He supports a woman's right to access them.  He also supports access to sex education and birth control, which will reduce the number of abortions that occur.
TwoXChromosomes X I haven't started using a cup yet, but even with sea sponge tampons (which squish up a LOT and I can't even feel them otherwise), it's personally just more comfortable to me to remove it to poop. You might be one of them too!
BabyBumps X I only got sick twice - both times due to motion sickness in the back of cabs (by the by, in case anyone is wondering, cab drivers are not overly sympathetic to you barfing all over their car, even if you are pregnant.)  So the lack of morning sickness was nice.  But I made up for it in migraines, fatigue, heartburn, and ligament pain!  Oh the joys of pregnancy.  Good luck and have fun trying!  
BabyBumps X I hate to tell you, but it only gets worse! :( I started having hip pain at about 7 weeks, now it's just terrible. 
BabyBumps X Yeah, emergency transfers require ambulances and they will take me to the closest hospital regardless. (Both of the closest have level IIIB NICUs.)  My midwives' transfers are overwhelmingly non-emergency. The bulk are first time moms (like me) for failure to progress or exhaustion. So if thats the case, I'll have time to figure out where to go. I know my midwives know the local hospitals, and will ask who's on call if that happens. But I have an OB that I love, who will take me if I need to transfer. Thing is, I know that hospitals and nurses can have a profound effect on a birthing experience. So maybe knowing more about the hospitals is prudent?  Then again, how much time should I spend on a statistically 8% chance of needing a non-emergency transfer?
TwoXChromosomes X This is why I'm going the educate the shit out of my kids. They will know everything there is to know about pregnancy, fertility, diseases and protection. And I will be the one to tell them. I'm not leaving it up the schools.
BabyBumps X I understand how upsetting something like this can be.  I wanted a natural birth but because of 2 very large fibroids by the birth canal, it's impossible and I need to have a c section.  I'm very upset about it, but what can you do?  As long as baby gets here safely that's all that matters *hugs*
BabyBumps X I think I miss Ibuprofen more than anything else I can't have during pregnancy. I'm so glad that some other women are having the same issue. Everyone I've talked to in person said "No, my hips didn't hurt at all during pregnancy."  They keep telling me "stay active and sleep on your left side with a pillow between your legs." Well.... great. I can't stay very active when I feel like I'm being stabbed in the hip every time I take a step, and sleeping with a pillow between my legs does NOTHING. Hell, most of the time it hurts when I'm laying down, too.....
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;It's called the period shits. The uterus is next to the intestines so whenever your uterus contracts to expel blood, it's also sending contractions through the intestines which is why you shit more on your period.  Ah hah!!  Thank you for this!  I always wondered about this. 
BabyBumps X It's awesome that your MW has such great connections to the hospital. Mine have no privileges and no really truly strong ties. (No homebirth MWs in my area do.) but they will stay with me as a doula should transfer be needed.
TwoXChromosomes X "Make the best out of a bad situation"  Would he still call it a "bad situation" if his wife or daughter were raped? Would they carry that child to term? Would he father a rapist's baby?
BabyBumps X The reasons that I suspected I was pregnant were I had no sex drive at all, when I did have sex it was uncomfortable (and that wasn't normal for me, especially right before my period and I didn't have an infection or anything), and my boobs didn't swell up/become sore before my period was due, and I woke up with weird tastes in my mouth.  I did have nausea, cramps, and I was super tired, but I always have those before I get my period, so I expected my period. It didn't show up, and three days later I got a positive pregnancy test. I still had a lot of cramping until I was about 9 weeks, and I have been really irritable since 8 weeks, but I wasn't irritable when my period was due.
TwoXChromosomes X Due to my bc, I no longer menstruate, but since I used the Divacup beforehand, I miss it. Thats how awesome my Divacup is.   If your flow is normal (as in, you don't suffer from conditions like endometriosis that cause you to bleed heavily enough to cause serious discomfort or endanger your health) then you should be able to keep it in place for an entire on-your-feet workday, and only worry about minor leakage on your heaviest days. My Divacup would help me forget I was even on the rag since it was so hassle free and there were no risks for TSS when I forgot to empty it at night. Is more expensive, up front, than a pack of pads or tampons, but you'll definitely feel the benefits after about one year of use. About once a year I'd need to buy pantiliners as a backup, for like $2.00 for 100, otherwise theres almost nothing else to buy until you have a baby and need to go up a size.  It may be messy during removal at first, but you'll get the hang of it pretty fast. I think some other people are slightly dramatic if they describe a scene out of Carrie. Theres some slight discomfort sometimes when the cup first opens up inside you, but it was nothing compared to my experiences with tampons (seriously, cried the first time. That should tell you something about how many thumbs up I give this product.)   I can not recommend the Divacup enough!!!
TwoXChromosomes X I used the cup for about three years. Getting it in is easy but I never got a real good hang of taking it out - actually, the firs time I got it in it took two days for me to scoop it out and until I did I had to keep letting it leak into the toilet by squeezing it.. but I've digressed. Other people were better at it than me, obviously, and I went back to regular tampons, though I hate those.  The only thing I didn't like was when you were in a public stall, a private sink isn't necessarily available, so you have to plan ahead (like maybe use tampons on these outings) cause on more than one occasion I flubbed and just emptied it and then put it back in without rinsing. It's not totally gross but it's not ideal. Also there was a chance that I'd spill it on my clothes or self. But like I said, I was slow to catch on..
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not who you were responding to, but I figured I'd put in my input here.  I actually thought the same thing, that I was ok with tampons, but after trying the DivaCup I realized I liked that so much better.  My cramps actually decreased which seemed impossible but it happened.  I can leave in the DivaCup for 12+ hours which is SO convenient without any leaks.  I never really thought about it but I definitely would sometimes notice a heavy or full feeling if my tampon was soaked and the DivaCup is nearly impossible to feel.  I sometimes forget I have my period, it's amazing.  It's true TSS is generally only an issue going past 8 hours but I always slightly worried about it because sometimes I'd want to change my tampon a bit before bed then sleep for 8-8.5 hours.  I leave my DivaCup in as long as I sleep sometimes quite a bit longer and have no issues.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using my cup for a little over a year now and I love it. It's definitely more comfortable and easier to deal with than a tampon. Plus, you don't have to worry about remembering to bring extra tampons with you when you go out. You just need to remember to bring the cup!  Before I tried it out, I read up on the product in a few forums first. There was one comment that definitely stuck out to me. Basically, when you wear the cup, the blood just collects in it until you dump it out. When you use a tampon, the blood is absorbed and essentially begins to rot in your body. I don't really get how it works, but it sounded gross to me.  Also, you don't have to worry about light days or heavy days. I used to hate wasting a 'super' tampon when it turned out that I didn't need it. For the cup, you just need to change it more or less often.
BabyBumps X With timing like that, I would most definitely insist your doctor watch your progesterone levels from the beginning. That's right before the baby would switch from your progesterone to the progesterone it's own placenta produces... it's very possible it could be something as simple as your body dropping off progesterone too early.  It could also, as quarkz said, just be because something was wrong with the baby and you just got so unlucky to have that happen three times. But I would definitely have this pregnancy monitored more closely to be sure.  Just "trying until you carry one to term" isn't a great way to go about it.
TwoXChromosomes X Try using more of an objective view rather than the subjective. Incorporate different scenarios that do not include your current circumstances.  I live the typical life of a wife and mother. I love my husband, have two beautiful boys, a home, and am putting myself through college. Ive never been in the situation where abortion was an option, nor was it even a thought. But this does NOT give me the right to assume I can understand what it is like to be in a dire situation where I am faced to raise a child alone, without helpful resources. I just feel its presumptuous to assume you know exactly how you would react in all situations.  
TwoXChromosomes X [Nyssa_Hotaru]( _Hotaru) has the description down right, I just had to add that it's the greatest thing to happen to my period in the 16 years I've had it. I've been using the Diva Cup for about 4 years now and I love that I don't have to remember to go out and stock up on tampons, I don't have to worry about leakage (once I figured out how to properly fit it - it takes a couple of times to figure it out and the trick is make sure it turns and isn't jammed because if it turns it's sitting up against your cervix and will catch everything) and frankly it's so comfortable that sometimes I even forget I have my period while wearing it. LOVE it. I recommend it to everybody I know.
TwoXChromosomes X You usually start the pill on the first day of your period, and your next 'period' will start 3 weeks later.  You can of course run a second pack straight on from the first, but for many women this will produce 'breakthrough bleeding', ie. your body decides to bleed despite the second pack.  This could be non-existant, spotting or as heavy as a period.  I'm afraid bleeding profiles are notoriously changeable between different drugs and different women so **noone will be able to tell you for sure how the pill will change your bleeding profile before you try it**.  I'd say go on the pill but don't be really upset if you have some bleeding when your SO comes round this time.  It might take some switching of brands etc to find one you like, but then you'll be able to plan your periods more effectively for the next time he's round.  
Parenting X that's the same situation i had with my son. he's just tall and lanky, it's his build, even at 4. i was so full of guilt and frustration at not being able to successfully breastfeed that i pumped pitiful little ounces of barely anything for 6 months. just wasn't going to happen.   yes, breastfeeding is wonderful and healthy and all that. yes, it's what ppl did throughout the long ages of history. but there were also, in the long ages of history, moms who couldn't provide enough milk for their babies. and there was no formula. and it was tragic.
BabyBumps X Definitely agree with you about the kicking. Not only does it reassure me that s/he (we didn't find out the gender) is still alive and, LOL, kicking, BUT it's really making my SO feel involved when he can place his hand on my belly and feel our little munchkin kick him. The baby isn't always cooperative, meaning sometimes it will be kicking me something fierce, but when he goes to feel, the baby stops. Last night was one of the first times, and I'm 29 weeks, that the baby kept kicking after I put his hand in the right place, and the look on his face just made me want to cry. And for once, I would have been crying because I was happy, not just because I'm hormonal.
TwoXChromosomes X Yep, there is suppose to be some air.  When inserting the cup, you are to spin it to open it up.  What you describe seems unusual to me.  I cannot feel my cup when I have it in place unless it starts to slip down.  Maybe the smaller size would help with the pain?
TwoXChromosomes X Why are you scared of an IUD? Are you thinking specifically with hormones (Mirena) or non-hormonal (copper)?  There is also the patch and the ring (each changed one day weekly), the shot (every three months) and the implant (swapped out every 2-5 years).  I think that you should use the search function for 2X and search for birth control - there are a *lot* of comments and it is a wealth of information by now. You might want to take a look at the Planned Parenthood website, as well as ask your doctor for which ones will be right for you. 
TwoXChromosomes X Plan B hasn't been shown to prevent implantation, it prevents ovulation. So if the OP had already ovulated it isn't surprising that Plan B did not work.  "There is controversy about whether such drugs may in some cases act not as a contraceptive but as a contragestive, a drug that prevents the implantation of a human embryo in the uterus, thus preventing pregnancy, although one study has concluded that this mechanism is unlikely." - [wikipedia]( _contraception)
BabyBumps X Hi Kakielynn, came across this and wondered how you're doing, you must be close if you haven't already had the baby. Are you feeling better about things? P.S. 7 weeks in and I still love being a mom. :)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Then your reproductive system belongs to the state.  Outlawing abortion wouldn't make it belong to the state. It would just mean pregnancy is still your problem, and you have fewer options regarding it. I'm not supporting an abolition of abortion, but I think you're sensationalizing it.
TwoXChromosomes X The best thing that worked for me? Sometimes they'll have empty toilet paper rolls in the trash. Wrap the used pad in the new wrapper, then in toilet paper, then into the toilet paper roll. Overkill? Yes. Neat and mostly discreet? Also yes. 
BabyBumps X However, some hospitals and doctors will take higher risk patients than others, which will result in higher caesarian birth rates.  If you are wanting to avoid a caesarian birth, check for hospitals that have 24 hour operating rooms.  Some smaller hospitals close their operating rooms overnight.  If it looks like a woman is might need a caesarian birth by 4 pm, the hospital preps her and takes her in.  This results in a lot of caesarian births around 5-6 pm.  The policy is to avoid emergency transfers, but could result in unnecessary caesarian births.    When I checked the caesarian rates for my area, the smaller hospitals had the highest rates.  This is the explanation my nurse midwife (who delivers at said hospitals) gave me.
BabyBumps X Everyone was convinced I was having a girl at the beginning of my pregnancy. When I went in and got a scan at 14 weeks to check out a burst ovarian cyst I swore I saw balls. Even after pointing them out to everyone on the scan they were in serious denial. At the 20 week scan his "goods" were pretty much the first thing we saw. I was just like "YEAH! I was right!"
Parenting X Cute baby :)  Congrats.  Next time don't tell them you are in labor, just call after the baby is born. - or maybe a week after.  I have to agree with Meramera, you get the job of kicking them out if your wife wants them gone.  
TwoXChromosomes X I actually have a (mid-thirties) friend who is going through that this week, after some lower risk tests identified some possible problems. She is terrified that the amnio will cause what could be a healthy fetus to miscarry, and alternatively, that it will show a problem serious enough for her to have to terminate.  Amnio is a miracle of science, yes, but it's also awful and not something I hope I ever have to go through.
TwoXChromosomes X I just had to have testing, and a LEEP procedure done, and all in all it cost  me about $1,200. (Illinois) I set up a payment plan with my gyno (most doctors and hospitals will do this) to pay it off over 4 months.  The thing here is, the longer you let this go untreated the more dangerous AND costly it is going to be to fix it down the road.  Cervical cancer is easily treatable,  it is not to easily treatable once it spread to your bladder, kidneys, and so on.  If you need to talk or have more questions feel free to PM me.    Please get this checked out soon.  I skipped a yearly exam one year and then I found out I had high grade dysplasia and some benign cancer growth.  If I had been proactive I could have had it treated when I was only in mild dysplasia and it would have been much cheaper and much easier.  EDIT: Also, if you want a breakdown of all my expenses I'd be happy to share.  All in all I ended up having to do 2 paps, 1 coloscopy, 1 biopsy, 3 tissue biopsy tests, and 1 LEEP procedure. I'll go in for another coloscopy in a few weeks to see if the LEEP took care of everything, but other than that I should be out of the woods.  
BabyBumps X My pregnancy was pretty easy at first - no morning sickness (just a little nausea), some "pregnancy brain," and as the baby grew I started to feel discomfort from crushed internal organs.  Money issues were and are still my biggest concern.  Then in my early third trimester I started having a little trouble eating - if I ate too much, which might only be a slice of toast one day, or a ten course meal the next day, I'd throw up.  I actually had to be hospitalized for about 7 hours yesterday because I couldn't stop throwing up and was starting to run a fever from severe dehydration.  It seemed to have been a problem started by the size/position of my baby, and then it just spiraled out of control.   Not fun at all.  I don't want to see that bill!
TwoXChromosomes X I must say, I can respect him for his consistency. If someone believes abortion is immoral, it shouldn't matter what event caused the pregnancy. Misguided or not, expressing such an unpopular opinion (I believe most people want to make exceptions for rape and incest) speaks to the sincerity of his belief. 
BabyBumps X I think it's different for everyone. Not everyone has the same reaction to alcohol, narcotics etc., so I don't know what your experience would be like, but for me it was like the feeling you get after having had just enough to drink so that your arms start feeling a bit heavy and you feel relaxed and happy, but not so much that you feel loopy or out-of-it or drunk. At no point did I feel "drugged" or "high"; I was able to communicate clearly and my thoughts weren't muddled or anything. I was just able to relax into the contractions a bit.   To put it into perspective, I had a finger monitor for my heart rate and mt husband watched it to assess my pain level and contractions. When I got topped up with the fentanyl (every half hour) my heart rate would drop to the high 50s and it was like I almost fell asleep until the next contraction. At rest my heart rate was normally mid 60s, when I was in pain it was mid 70s, big pain was mid 80s and by the time it was in the mid 90s again I would be asking for more drugs because the pain was extreme. So it definitely made a difference, because the contractions right after getting topped up were a lot more manageable and I was a lot less stressed.   I would recommend trying fentanyl to anyone who thinks they will likely (or definitely) want pain medication. It wears off quite quickly, so if you don't like how it makes you feel, you can just not get another dose and it's out of your system pretty quickly. And it doesn't stop you from getting an epidural later if you want it. I will say that it didn't help at all during the pushing stage - they topped me up twice during that time, once when I was sitting on the toilet and trying not to push and once when I moved onto the bed on all fours, and I don't remember feeling ANY reduction in pain. But feeling everything during pushing was good - it helped me find positions that worked and I was able to push with the contractions and with my body. Good luck with your upcoming labour, and I hope everything goes smoothly for you - whether or not you end up needing medication! :)
BabyBumps X I didn't care about the gender either way, but since the beginning i just "felt" like he was a boy. I had 1 or 2 dreams that he was a boy and always referred to him as "him" on accident before I found out. It's hard to explain but a girl just didn't *feel* right. My boyfriend and his family all thought it would be a girl. Found out he was a boy at 19wk ultrasound, reconfirmed at 33 week ultrasound.
TwoXChromosomes X Sure it isn't 100% effective, but it's 99.9% effective with perfect use and I've always used it perfectly.  I was in a long-term relationship and we both were were virgins before having sex.  I never took my pill more than 10 minutes late, we used condoms in the case of vomiting/diarrhea/antibiotics/etc.  The pill is intended to be a single use method.  Of course you can add to protection by using more methods, but I still wouldn't say it isn't very safe to just use the pill as long as you take it correctly and have no STD concerns. 
TwoXChromosomes X What do you mean most-fertile week?  Do you mean the week off the pill?   I've never heard anything that suggests this week is any riskier unless you take your first pill of the pack late. 
TwoXChromosomes X On the cultural relativism side of things, I find it interesting that in the Wiki article on Genital mutilation, FGM is described as what it is - horrific and banned in so very many countries. Circumcision is stated as being a religious thing with a short bit about how its still the subject of much debate.  Some of the forms of FGM are roughly comparable to circumcision (I don't believe it possible for there to be direct comparison because of the differences of biology), so I still don't get how one is so horrific and the other isn't. You're still removing/altering part of someone's body without their consent.  * Not trying to make it all about the men, just pointing out an inconsistency in how society views pretty much the same thing for the two genders.
TwoXChromosomes X If you are taking a combined pill, you do not have a "most fertile" week because you are not ovulating.
Parenting X You're only a few days in? For my wife, she was dry for the first few days, and then was knocking out 100+ per session... We actually had trouble with oversupply when transitioning back to the breast.  Seriously though, she would do the massage/compressions, into the pump outlet on her lap, and then after doing the whole boob, she would pump after.. It seemed to help a lot.
TwoXChromosomes X If you don't take the pill as directed you are completely wasting your money, time and effort.  You will not be protected from a pregnancy and you will be throwing your hormones and period for a loop.  Your body will be so confused as to what is going on you could begin spotting or miss a period and you never know you could end up pregnant.  Either stop taking the pill or take it as advised.  And I'd suggest maybe doing a little self research on how "the pill" works, so that  you can better understand the science behind the pill and why it won't work if you don't take it as directed.  I don't mean to come off as rude, but if you're on the pill you should be old enough to understand it's effects on your body and if you don't you should definitely make that a priority.  
BabyBumps X My husband and I are taking hypnobabies (which is a little bit different but has some major similarities). It is a lot of practice (daily for at least a half hour, which I didn't know before signing up!). You basically practice hypnosis, reframing your mind and how to relax very deeply. For the class we are taking, my husband reads scripts to me every other day, and on the off days, I listen to a CD. It really focuses on using the birth partner so if he is not on board I would recommend finding a good friend or family member who can attend the classes with you. (in addition to a doula). It does focus mostly on trying to birth naturally so if Bradley isn't for you guys, this one might not be either. 
BabyBumps X I also consider myself an intuitive person. In the beginning of my pregnancy I thought it was a girl and then I had a dream that it was a boy about 3 months in. So I thought it was a boy. Then we got the 20 week ultra sound done and its a girl. Im wont be calling it anything until I know next time : )
BabyBumps X I made a birth plan but knew it would probably all go out the window...it did.  I did think it was helpful for me to get a better idea of every little thing that goes on and to know all my options.
TwoXChromosomes X The HPV vaccines only protect you from the 4 strains *out of hundreds* of HPV that are known to cause cervical cancer. It's good that you got the shots, but you still have to be careful. 
AskWomen X You take it out while sitting on the toilet, so any overflow falls right in. There's also a lot less blood during a period than people think, so usually the max you have to empty out is one or two teaspoons. I say usually, since every woman is different. I've never had more than that at a time though, and I usually empty mine every 6 hours or so.   
TwoXChromosomes X Going to the toilet is natural too, but you wouldn't want to see that in public I guess.  Also I would not exactly look at any animal sucking milk from any breasts for fun, I'm not horribly disgusted by it but I don't spend my time looking at that neither. For me personally it is just not nice to look at women who take out their breasts in public to let babies suck on them, sorry. I wouldn't forbid it, of course, but I have the right to my opinion and the right to look away and not like it. I wouldn't do it in public either, but to each their own.
TwoXChromosomes X We scream "breast is best" and advocate for breastfeeding, and often make buying formula as embarrassing for new moms as embarrassing as teenagers buying condoms. Stop forcing moms to hide out in dirty bathroom stalls to feed their babies. Plus, you don't see breastfeeding moms sitting in every corner of every place you go into. Maybe you see a breastfeeding mom once a week, if that. Is it really THAT bad? Are you really THAT immature? Breastfeeding is natural and better for the baby, it is not sexual- it should be encouraged! Seriously John Q Public, get over it. 
Parenting X *some hospitals* I can't find the article right now, but I'll try to track it down.    Regardless, most hospitals will start to push Pitocin, the synthetic from of Oxitocen, which is the hormone your body produces to induce contractions, after 12 hours.    This effectively limit's labor time in that, once you get Pitocen, your contractions become so intense that you either have your baby quickly, or they will be forced to perform a c-section.
Parenting X I agree %100.  Home births are great when they're medically responsible, but a hospital backup should be maintained for if complications arise.
Parenting X The labor for my first baby was less than 2 hours.  I did not make it to the hospital and had him on the floor of my bedroom with my husband, 2 cops, and my mom taking pictures.  It was rather exciting, but I could've done without all the intervention in the hospital after we were transported.  I'm planning a home birth for this next one.
TwoXChromosomes X No matter who you talk to, they're going to have different things to say about different forms of birth control, so I don't think any comment in this thread should make you say "Gee, that's the one for me!" You're going to have to do the research and see what level of hormones (if any) works with your body.  That being said, there are TONS of options and you NEED to find one that works for you... the sooner the better. Go to plannedparenthood.org and search their birth control- there's the pill (many different types/hormone levels), the patch, the ring, the IUD, the implant, and probably more I'm forgetting. Personally, I'm on a form of the pill (Ortho Tri Cyclen) and love it, but like I said, ultimately, you'll have to just try one out and see how it goes. :/
TwoXChromosomes X My periods were fairly easy, with an episode of bad cramping and heavy flow once or twice a year.   In the year and a half since I got Paragard, I've had *no* cramps and no heavier bleeding than before.
TwoXChromosomes X First of all, you said you don't have any feeling of discomfort, but if you do in the future while using a tampon, it means that the tampon hasn't been inserted correctly. You shouldn't be able to feel it, so if it hurts/is uncomfortable, remove it and try again.  Your tampon shouldn't just come out by accident, but watch out for big sneezes and the like. Also, make sure you're careful about taking one out before putting another in. I've had two tampons in at once before without even realizing it.  The worst thing about wearing a tampon (and something to be ready for) is the awful feeling you'll experience if the tampon is too dry and you try to take it out. The dry, scratchy cotton will not feel pleasant.  Make sure you only wear each one for 8 hours (at most) and you only wear the absorbency needed. Toxic Shock Syndrome has flu-like symptoms. Be careful.   tl;dr : Tampons, yay.
TwoXChromosomes X starting out on heavy days, you might want to wear a panty liner and/or pad until you get the hang of how your flow works with tampons. for example, on heavy days i had to change mine every 4-5 hours, on lighter days i might not have to change it all day!   also, always carry an extra one or two. the most annoying is when i felt like i should change it, just to take it out and realize it was fine. gr!
TwoXChromosomes X I would recommend that you get the HPV vaccine first, if you haven't already.  Men can't be tested for the strains which can cause cervical cancer in women, so they often don't know they have it until they give it to someone else.
BabyBumps X I have looked, but there are none that I (I should say my mother) would trust. I love, love, love my midwife and she's only available at the hospital I'm delivering at. Birthing center is a good middle ground, I agree.
BabyBumps X I can't see flair on phone, how far along are you?  I felt BH at 18 weeks (maybe earlier) and they see obvious if I touched my belly. It felt like a softball, totally hard. Rest, feet up, and water decreased their frequency.
TwoXChromosomes X That is totally inconsistent. A life should not be defined by whether or not it can feel biological pain. Besides, parts of the fetus's nervous system develop at a different rate than the brain, adding further complications to this argument. Instead, the line should be drawn at conception, so that we can be consistent in affording unborn humans the same civil rights they deserve, regardless of their development.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Yes, but where is the woman in that? The ONLY concern is for the welfare of the fetus (and only so long as it is in the womb, fuck it after it's born).   Yeah.  I'm pretty sure pro lifers are also opposed to murdering babies.
TwoXChromosomes X That seems like weasely language to me. It's not a "clump of cells." It's a viable human organism. There's no sensical definition of a human being to which it would not subscribe. It's a non-sentient (to the extent we can even define such a thing) human being, but so is a guy in a coma.  Otoh there's the self-defense argument; pregnancy is a pretty traumatic experience and there's no reason women can or should be forced to go through it.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm against abortion but also pro choice since I am aware of the consequences of an unintended pregnancy. My views don't have anything to do with women and I would feel the same if men could get pregnant. I think abortion as birth control is wrong but am willing to accept it rather  than the alternative. 
BabyBumps X You can but you shouldn't! Why is it a common belief in the western world that this is safe? ''Although many women are aware that heavy drinking during pregnancy can cause birth defects, many do not realize that moderate or even light drinking also may harm the fetus. In fact, no level of alcohol use during pregnancy has been proven safe.'' _indepth.html
TwoXChromosomes X but for all scientific arguement, until the fetus reaches the stage of viability, doesn't it fit the definition of a parasite which feeds off of the host to survive?
TwoXChromosomes X I have also heard that plain yogurt can help if there is external discomfort as well.  There are cranberry pills that have no sugar added which I find very helpful for keeping everything a little more regulated on a daily basis.
TwoXChromosomes X Is it really? How far can you push that logic? If a baby is born, clearly it wrong to kill it. If a woman comes into the hospital a day before she's due and asks for an abortion, is it okay to do it then?  I see very little difference between the two. I would make the argument that it's just as much a person before and after the birth. So how far back do we go before saying that the baby is not a human and is actually a potential human? You might say here, at X weeks, or at Y stage of development. The pro-lifers would probably say much earlier, possibly even conception. The question now isn't whether or not a potential human deserves the same rights, but rather what does 'potential human' even mean. Can you make a sound definition for 'potential human'? I don't think you really can.   I'm prochoice, but I don't think that's the right way to think about the argument. 
TwoXChromosomes X A woman has a right not to be murdered, and so does the child, even if it's not yet born. If the woman not having the right to kill her child is removing her autonomy, then you have to understand that it's all about balancing rights and not about "this person's rights are more important". My right to set fires against my neighbour's right to not have me burn his house down, for example.  But wait you'll say, a foetus is not equivalent to a child! Yes, I agree. But they don't. **All of this is me trying to help everyone understand their position. I am not against abortion being legal.**
TwoXChromosomes X Have we argued so much that the entire process of birth has become just another meaningless event in the growth of cells into a person? The mere existence of this hyperbole argument in this debate strike me as so bizarre and detached.  anti-choicers might believe a fetus is a person, but they all celebrate their birthdays right? I've never heard of anyone celebrating their conception day. Why? because birth is an important event in our life, and it is when life actually starts. before that we're nothing but a parasite in our dear mother's body, with or without conciseness.
TwoXChromosomes X No. It prevents implantation of a fertilized egg. Pregnancy occurs not when an egg gets fertilized, but when a fertilized egg implants into the uterine wall. 
TwoXChromosomes X consciousness is a very fuzzy line, and what's to say even a newborn baby is conscious?  Birth itself is a very concrete distinguisher - before that the fetus, while you might say is already alive, is a creature that is totally dependent on his mother's body, after that it lives on its own.  You originally said you see a very little difference, I'd say that is a pretty big difference. That's not to say abortions are always morally right, but saying there is little difference between an unborn and a newborn?
TwoXChromosomes X So is Victoria Woodhull saying that women having sex are enslaved, or that women who aren't happy to give birth at any time are enslaved? Or was there 100% effective birth control back then?
TwoXChromosomes X And I never said that I would personally ever have an abortion either, but I'm not going to call other women irresponsible for choosing to have an abortion when you don't know the context. 
BabyBumps X I completely agree, Korea has a hard time moving forward sometimes and I found out (in a more difficult way) that this includes their birthing methods. They do have other options and more progressive hospitals, she just came right before we were to visit the one I thought I'd deliver at. My hospitals prenatal care was top notch though, I really did enjoy and feel comfortable with my doctor and the facilities at the hospital. 
TwoXChromosomes X How is is more complicated to pick and choose which situations are "extreme," but somehow far too complicated to simply say "it's illegal to restrict your patients' medical rights based on your religious beliefs"?  That's pretty damn clear cut. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had mine for seven years, but you should really keep yours for no more than five.   I too had spotting almost non-stop for the first three months.   After that, I had spotting every 35-40 days to coincide with my cycle.  My other menstrual symptoms were non-existent to fairly light. It hurt like a bitch going in, but I didn't pass out or anything.  Some ibuprofen and a juice box helped considerably.    My sex drive was more or less the same after placement.    I would highly recommend this product.  PS.  When/if you decide to have kids, it takes like no time at all for the hormones to exit your system. 
BabyBumps X Yup, adding to the list of US women who have shitty benefits.  I don't actually get maternity leave.  I can apply for short term disability for 12 weeks at 66% pay, and that's because I'm one of 20% in my store that works full time.  They don't have to approve the full 12 weeks either, if the doctor says I can go back to work, my disability pay stops.  If I worked part time, I'd have nothing.  If I were male asking for paternity leave, I'd only have my vacation time and sick time to fall back on.    I couldn't imagine if I were waiting tables or bartending still, oof. =(
TwoXChromosomes X I have a Paragard and I just wanted to tell you that IUD insertion isn't super painful for everybody. Mine barely hurt for like 3 seconds. And I was only 19 when I got it in.  Check out [IUD Divas]( -divas.livejournal.com) for some more Mirena experiences.
TwoXChromosomes X Your body may just be sensitive to the hormones. Have you thought about non-hormonal BC options, like a copper IUD?
TwoXChromosomes X My cramps got worse, and I gained 30 pounds in 6 months when I had been previously due to getting a more active job, but inserting it only felt like bad cramps. 23 at the time, no previous pregnancies. No change in sex drive, my periods became light spotting, although it took 6 months before that kicked in, during the adjustment period my periods became longer before fading away. I've had it over a year and a half and I love it, planning to get a new one when this one gets old.
TwoXChromosomes X Before you hurry to try hormonal BC, [read this thread]( _whove_been_married_and_had_sex_less_than/) from r/sex/ of women who find themselves negatively affected by it.   It's a very common reason for women having a lowered sex drive, and in many cases they discovered renewed interest when going off it.    Hormonal BC will affect everyone differently.  Among my friends, there are many who suffered negative side effects such as unwarranted weight gain, painful breast swelling, mood changes, breakouts, and diminished sex drive.  You may be fine or you may not!   Don't rush to try it for the sake of it.  Consider a copper IUD or other barrier options.   Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X Well since im on birth controll pills my periods arent horror anymore, Just the usuall cramps lots of blood and clot's for 5 days.  I figured if this happenend to me another time i will go to the doctor.   For now i just really wondered if this is a common thing since this never happened to me before in the 4 years im on birthcontroll pills. (turning 19 next month)   As far i read here, its nothing to be terrified for. so thanks all =)
BabyBumps X The FISH test came back normal, but the deeper chromosome results had some abnormalities on the 18th chromosome.  We see the specialist tomorrow.  Hope your news is better than ours.
TwoXChromosomes X Stay away from anything with glycerin or propylene glycol! I don't have any vaginal moisturizers but for lube I like Oceanus the Natural warming lube. $11 for 4 oz including shipping.
BabyBumps X Put on a pad and clean undies, lay down for 30 mins. If it's amniotic fluid, it will have a chance to "pool" together, and it then it will flow out onto the pad when you stand up. Your care provider should also have a type of paper ( like litmus paper) that would change to a certain color if it came in contact with amniotic fluid. (I had a few "OMG, did my water break?" moments during my last few weeks. When my water broke (which only happens to 10-15% of women before active labor), it was much different than the previous times. Warm fluid slowly flowed out onto a pad a few times an hour. Everyones different though.)  Good luck! You can always call your doc/ hospital/ midwife if you're unsure. 
TwoXChromosomes X slightly gross feeling, but I've never had a big problem with it.  I've skipped periods by running pill packs together (the brand I was on didn't have a placebo week, just 3 weeks of pills then nothing for a week) before without any problems, I only got spotting after doing it several months in a row (3 or 4, I can't remember). But even if you did get spotting, it'd be less flow than a normal period, so easier to deal with.
TwoXChromosomes X Hormonal birth control is highly dependent on your individual body chemistry. Just because one brand works for someone doesn't mean that it will work for you, and vice versa. All combined pills have the same potential side effects anyway, and the only way to know if a certain brand will work for you is to actually try it. HBC is really a hit-or-miss kind of thing. But your doctor is the best person to discuss this with, not people over the internet.
TwoXChromosomes X I am not planning on doing anything crazy for the next few weeks "just in case". I will take a pregnancy test immediately if I miss my period. Right now it is too soon. 
BabyBumps X I am at 16 weeks and am down a lb or two from pre-pregnancy weight. I weigh 148 at 5'6, which means I was at the upper range of healthy weight pre-pregnancy. I am a little concerned about the lack of weight gain but I think it may be due to stopping wine and beer.   OP, I think we all gain weight differently. If you remember that you're only supposed to eat a little more than usual, and exercise when you can, I wouldn't worry about it. Your doctor will mention it if it's a concern.
TwoXChromosomes X If you use birth control talk to your doctor about switching to one where you can go like 3 months without a period, very convenient. When I asked I found out I don't even have to switch, I can just start taking mine like the 3 month cycle pills because they have the same amount of hormones. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just read this after posting about my pills, and I don't think you can skip the placebos for that long with just any pills - they have varying levels of hormones. But I have heard its fine to skip one period with just about any kind as long as you don't do it all the time. I would talk to your gyno before skipping more than one period
TwoXChromosomes X Your pill should have a website that you can go to, if you don't have the pamphlet, where you can read up on what to do if you miss a pill.  Usually if you only miss one pill, and take it the next day, you are fine. If you are still worried, you should take a pregnancy test in a few days.
TwoXChromosomes X Assuming you're taking a pill with a placebo week, don't take seven days worth of the placebo pill. If you want your period to be on Thursday only do six, if you want it on Wednesday only do five, et c. There is no harm in doing less placebo days- just an issue of doing more.  Edit: spelling
BabyBumps X I'm almost always lopsided! My baby loves her bum being out and rubbing against my ribs, making me look like I've got a huge growth under my left breast. It's horribly uncomfortable!
TwoXChromosomes X If you stack packs (take them back-to-back, without a break for the placebos), you could end up spotting. It depends on the person and how long you stack for. I stacked two packs together once and ended up bleeding for the last 3 weeks of the second pack (like heavy, period-level bleeding). It was unpleasant, to say the least, and I have never attempted to stack again. Other people can stack for months without any spotting. The longer that you stack for, the more likely you are to experience breakthrough bleeding. 
BabyBumps X I started at 117 lbs and i currently weigh 130. So I have gained 13 lbs so far and i'll be 23 weeks on thursday. With my last pregnancy i started at 96 lbs and ended up around 147. I was underweight the first time so my doctor had advised at least a 40 lb gain (crazy right?) I'm trying to avoid a 51 lb weight gain this time. Hoping I can hover around 145 at the end of this one and no more. 
BabyBumps X The article conveniently leaves out:  Advocates of hospital births often die in childbirth too.   Research has shown that attended homebirth is no less safe than hospital birth for low risk pregnancies. Places where midwives have licensing and adequate training tend to be very conservative and willing to transfer care to hospital at the slightest urgency.  There is usually ample opportunity for transfer in most transfer cases.   Of course, hemorrhage is a possibility at any birth, but it can be managed at home in mild cases, and often long enough to seek medical attention in more severe cases.  Midwives are skilled professionals.  Again, there is a risk in every birth. This article is full of needless sensationalism, and thin on facts.   Things I want to know are:  What was the nature of the emergency?  How far was her home from hospital?
BabyBumps X I think it looks like a girl. But, when our tech told us we were having a girl, she said she only says she's 85% sure in the case of calling it for a girl. Something can always be hiding. Fortunately, we had several follow up U/S and confirmed each time it was a girl. So, take it with a grain of salt and maybe get a private 3D scan in a few weeks to confirm?
BabyBumps X For the last 6 weeks my baby has been sitting way up high, just under my ribs. But her little butt has been rubbing up against the ribs on my right side. She's decided that's not where my ribs should be, and has made it her mission to move them before her birth. All I can do is try to move her down and away (find her body and push on it gently). It doesn't always work, so I have to lean back and to the left to give my ribs some extra room.
Parenting X Recent data has shown that home-birth (with qualified, medically trained, regulated mid-wives) is just as safe as hospital birth.
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks for asking this question, as I'm contemplating getting a copper IUD myself as well. I hate being on the pill (have been for over 8 years already) but here in Holland copper IUDs are almost never used, because nearly all doctors prefer the hormonal stuff. And I really want to get rid of those damn hormones. Not having a sex drive for 8 years is really sad :(
BabyBumps X I've got anterior placenta, too!  I started to feel kicks right around 20 weeks, and they've really been ramping up the last week or so.  I find I feel them most if I'm sitting and leaning forward or lying on my back (which I'm told you're not meant to do for extended periods of time).  You'll feel some kicks soon :D
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for over a year and no effect on my sex drive. Yes insertion hurts, and you can have sporadic cramping for a few months. But it fades after that. I love my IUD
AskWomen X Quick insight. I has an IUD inserted about a year and a half ago and apart from the initial pain of having it *cough* inserted it's been great. I have had only about 4 day long periods on it (obviously different from person to person) so I cannot complain. The nurse tells you men cannot feel it when you have sex, this is a lie.
AskWomen X The not feeling it varies from partner to partner - it may be true for the OP. I know my man can't feel it. IF you can, a little tip is to insert a finger in and wind the string behind your cervix. For a lot of women though, eventually the string will curl up and become unable to feel too.
BabyBumps X I had one with my first! I felt kicks at 19 weeks. This time I don't have an anterior and I'll tell you the biggest difference already is the kicks feel a lot stronger without an AP. With my first, when she would roll or stick a body part out I could see it for sure, but I couldn't really tell what it was. I'm told that without the anterior placenta, I should be able to feel whole body parts and know what they are. 
TwoXChromosomes X Does anyone who has really bad menstrual cramps have input on this? A doctor told me that getting a (copper) IUD would probably feel like "the worst cramp you've ever had"... the worst cramps I've ever had caused me to vomit four times and be driven to student health only half-aware of what was going on.   Will IUD insertion be worse for me than most women? 
BabyBumps X I have an anterior placenta and didn't feel baby kick until I was 22 weeks.  
BabyBumps X Holy crap we're like twins. I went in for my 24 week appointment and the doctor told me I had gained ELEVEN pounds. I wanted to die. I was still overweight from my last baby and had just lost 30 pounds then boom, pregnant. now I've exploded to the biggest I've ever been. If things keep going at this rate I'll be 300 pounds by the time this baby is out. **not cool** :( 
BabyBumps X You're not starving your child and you're not trying to lose weight, just STOP GAINING.  There's a big difference.  At her weight (and mine) there are more than enough fat reserves for breastfeeding.  The only necessary weight gain is actual baby weight, placenta, and some fluids, totaling about 14 pounds.  Anything over that is excessive in the eyes of any medical professional.
TwoXChromosomes X You're mischaracterizing the debate. It isn't just about a woman's right over her own body. The real core of the debate revolves around the question: "When in time does a fetus become *human*". As soon as we consider a fetus a human it's usually agreed upon that the fetus should be given *rights* associated with human beings, namely the right to life. So the conflict in the debate is entirely due to the fact the pro-lifers define the starting point for personhood earlier than the pro-choicers. 
TwoXChromosomes X * [Komen said it could not continue to fund Planned Parenthood because it has adopted new guidelines that bar it from funding organizations under congressional investigation.]( -klein/post/susan-g-komen-foundation-defunds-planned-parenthood/2012/01/31/gIQAACW0fQ_blog.html)  * [In the tapes, a Live Action actor calls 30 Planned Parenthood clinics in 27 different states, inquiring about mammograms at Planned Parenthood. Every Planned Parenthood, without exception, tells her she will have to go elsewhere for a mammogram, and many clinics admit that no Planned Parenthood clinics provide this breast cancer screening procedure. We dont provide those services whatsoever, admits a staffer at Planned Parenthood of Arizona. Planned Parenthoods Comprehensive Health Center clinic in Overland Park, KS explains to the caller, We actually dont have a, um, mammogram machine, at our clinics.]( -parenthood-ceos-false-mammogram-claim-exposed/)
BabyBumps X Oh god... Prepregnancy I weighed in at 120lbs.  First trimester I dropped down to 105.  Last doc appoint (Jan 3) I weighed 118.  I've probably gained another 5 pounds in the last three weeks.  So, about 3lbs in 28 weeks! Not good!!!!!
TwoXChromosomes X The vagina is self-cleaning, so you shouldn't need anything but water to clean it (unless you have an infection or something, and a doctor tells you otherwise). That said, I use water (of course) and whatever soap I use, just lightly and never so that it gets up inside. I've never had any problems, but YMMV.
TwoXChromosomes X Just fyi, if her doctor is doing it just for an abnormal pap, that is unusual.  I had several abnormal paps before they finally did a colposcopy, and I believe it was because there were actual "possible pre-cancerous cells," which is a level above "abnormal cells."  I don't want to worry you - mine came back totally fine, no cancer in sight - but for the women in here, if you get an abnormal pap, it doesn't necessarily mean you need a colposcopy.
TwoXChromosomes X Depends on your age, usually, and whether or not you test positive for HPV.  When my wife had an abnormal pap when she was under 30 they waited to see if the next test was also abnormal (it was not at the time);  more recently however her doctor ordered an HPV test, then a colposcopy after that test came back positive.   tl;dr  Getting old sucks.
TwoXChromosomes X Well I'm not my wife but she got one a few months back and her side effects are strange.  She has always has been a light flow person. Really easy periods overall. After getting the iud the periods were wacky. One day heavy flow the next 3 no period the all of a sudden period again. It was like that for about 3 months before it became regular again. It is still a heavier flow but is 100% better than any other birth control we have tried.   Hope that helps
Parenting X I actually looked at the data set they used, and found that, for my demographic at least, it was untrue.    I don't know where all those other dead babies are coming from, but my guess is that any baby found in a dumpster with no identification is considered a "home birth."    For our age, education level, etc etc, having a home birth was actually safer than a hospital birth by a factor of two. (and very safe I might add at about... 1:40000)     People will take that and say, "well, all the high-risk pregnancies went to the hospital," and to that I say "great, high-risk pregnancies should go to the hospital"  
TwoXChromosomes X I've had my Mirena for nearly 5 years (getting it replaced this summer) and I'm one of the lucky ones where insertion didn't hurt at all and compared to when I was on the pill, my sex drive went waaaaay up. Not sure if it returned to "normal" or not since I had been on the pill for years and years before I became sexually active so I have nothing to compare it to, but my boyfriend is a lot happier now :p  I also haven't had a "real" period in about 4 years, as compared to every two to three weeks even on the pill. Needless to say, I'm a huge personal Mirena fan :)
TwoXChromosomes X Colpo is just the process of spraying the vinegar solution on your cervix and having a look-see at what shows up. Typically they do then biopsy a worry spot, since they won't give you a colpo unless they are worried to begin with. But the colpo part is actually the easy bit! 
TwoXChromosomes X I realize this. And I wasn't trying to diminish the importance of screening tests for Paps. My original point was that cervical cancer takes a while to show up. Not that pap smears should be delayed, or that pre-cancerous lesions shouldn't be removed.
TwoXChromosomes X Is there a difference between a coloscopy and a cervical biopsy? Because I had a coloscopy done a few weeks ago (It wasn't like relaxing, but it wasn't the worst thing of my life either). The test from that came back positive for cancer, and now I have to schedule a cone biopsy. I was under the impression that they were two different procedures. (And expect that the second one is gonna probably actually hurt.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Yes it would be nice if I chose to lend it what it needs, but I should not be forced to.  Fair enough, but the issue isn't whether you will "lend it what it needs" but rather whether you will terminate it.  Termination requires you to act.  Most philosophies differentiate between not doing something to help someone else and actively doing something to hurt someone else.  When a pregnant woman terminates a fetus, her actions go beyond simply withholding aid to the fetus.  (I agree with you about being pro-choice, btw.  But I think that the moral argument you've advanced here is flawed.)
TwoXChromosomes X There's not only an oral HPV, there's skin HPV as well. Better known as plantar warts (on the foot), common warts, and flat warts, these are caused by other strains of HPV. Anogenital warts are caused by HPV as well, but the kinds that cause visible warts aren't the cancerous kinds everyone worries about (16 and 18). The HPV vaccine doesn't protect against those though :(  That's interesting about penile cancer, was unaware of that. I know the main culprit is uncircumcised men who haven't been educated on proper hygiene for their foreskin (yet another controversial issue!)  I'm curious about insurance coverage of Gardasil for men as well. That would be pretty sweet to have covered! I heard that the screening standards were recently changed to suggest all men receive the vaccine, so hopefully insurance will follow suit with coverage. Alas, I deal with shitty US insurers as well =\
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 23 yo and had only one abnormal pap and was given a biopsy. Many times biopsies are given after only one abnormal because of the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous cells (even though sometimes a pap shows up as "abnormal" for other reasons).
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;HPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, but not the only cause.  True, but it's good to note that over 99% of cervical cancer has HPV virus in it. It's the main cause. 
TwoXChromosomes X Colposcopy &amp; cervical biopsy are 2 different procedures but usually done at the same time. Colposcopy is looking at the cervix with a microscope &amp; then they put a series of solutions (vinegar &amp; Betadine) on it to see if the cells change color. Then they'll take a biopsy based on how the cells look. A biopsy isn't always needed though. 
BabyBumps X Use orange juice since vitamin C helps you absorb the iron.  Ah, I see you use floradix, it already contains some vitamin C rich fruits. I found it easier than pills. You can also take your full dosis once daily if you skipped one (big plus for me since I barely remember taking medicines). 
TwoXChromosomes X $50! I was a volunteer at Planned Parenthood while I was in college and used their clinics for years for my exams and birth control until I got a job with health insurance.
TwoXChromosomes X Pregnancy does not come without risk and there are temporary effects that will certainly happen.  To a woman who is carrying an unwanted fetus this is an invasion of her body and a potential risk to her health and her entire future that she does not consent to.  When a person is being assaulted or their body used against their will, "reasonable force" may legally be used to stop a threat.  In the specific case of pregnancy, abortion is the only method we have of not requiring a pregnant woman have her body violated while carrying an unwanted fetus to term. 
TwoXChromosomes X Most of those women were able to receive safe, non-life threatening abortions. In countries where abortion is illegal, there are about [68,000]( _4.pdf) yearly deaths from unsafe abortions. 
TwoXChromosomes X The Mirena may actually work out better for you if you're willing to try it. Since it only has progestin, it won't give you the same side effects as the pills/Nuvaring you were on before. It does have 5 years worth of hormones, but releases them at a really slow rate, giving you one of the lowest possible doses of any HBC.  However, the fact that you've had the Paragard for 4 years and are just now noticing these symptoms makes me think that something else may be wrong here. I highly suggest you go to to gyno/PP as soon as you can before thinking about switching BC methods.
Parenting X &gt;We are the only developed country that does not require paid maternity leave.  Canada doesn't require it.  Maternity leave comes from unemployment insurance.   The employer pays nothing while the woman is on leave. 
TwoXChromosomes X You may be bone tired. Like a fatigue you've never felt before. Also, super tender breasts. Those were pretty much my only pregnancy symptoms in the first trimesters of my pregnancies.
BabyBumps X i can't lay on my back anymore.  it hurts me even when i go to the midwife for visits and she has me lay down to check the baby.  i'm huge and all the baby weight just goes right to my spine and starts to hurt.  we have done side stuff but not for a while as my belly has gotten so much larger.  it's all doggy style (tmi? sorry!!!) now because he also feels weird if he sees my belly or feels it when we have sex (because sometimes the baby moves which even for me is a little strange).
TwoXChromosomes X Neither the article nor I said that oral contraceptives give you HPV. You know what gives you HPV? Objects covered in HPV inserted into your business. No one is objecting that.  What I'm saying is, and what the article is saying is, that when you take oral contraceptives, your chance of getting cervical cancer increases. How does that work exactly? I don't know. We know that if you have certain strains of HPV, you will develop cervical cancer. This does not mean that oral contraceptives = HPV = cervical cancer. It just means that somehow, oral contraceptives plays a role. Like I said previously, my guess, as a member of the medical and health care community, is that oral contraceptives somehow causes your cervix to be more susceptible to HPV.  Oral contraceptives do not cause HPV or cervical cancer. They just increase your risk of cervical cancer.  Is this making sense.
TwoXChromosomes X I didn't have any problems at first with PAPs, but after having a cervical biopsy, PAPs now hurt. :/
BabyBumps X In the UK only pregnancies that might run into trouble are dealt with by doctors and even then the majority of care is still given by midwives. Most midwives (in the UK) have delivered more babies than the doctors on call. Providing that you are sure that the midwife is qualified and experienced you should have no problems. I would highly suggest you check out their background as I'm not entirely sure that Midwife is a protected term in the states. Up coming rant, sorry! Doula is not a protected term and while some can be great a comfort and advocate to a mother, a birth should be monitored by a trained medical professional.  
BabyBumps X My water broke first, and I immediately started having contractions. But it was 5 in the morning, so I went back to sleep. After breakfast I went for a walk to get them started again.  I'm so glad I had a home birth after reading all these comments, I had no idea hospitals put so much pressure on you after your water breaks!! Another woman under my midwife's care went a week after her water broke before her contractions picked up. As long as there is no fever and the baby is moving and has a good heart rate, everything is fine.
BabyBumps X My water broke just before 1am and contractions started about 5 minutes later.  We got to the hospital at 4am with contractions coming every 5 or 6 minutes.  I dilated to 9cm by 2pm, but my son was sunny side up, so at midnight (23 hours after water broke) I was given pitocin to try and increase the contraction strength to get him to turn.  He was born at 8:45 am after 32 hours of back labor.
TwoXChromosomes X Certain clinics provide medical and surgical abortions.
TwoXChromosomes X No, but it isn't a major medical event that requires medical intervention from beginning to end.  
Parenting X See a child health nurse, lactaton consultant and/or GP. In my experience, child health nurses can be very helpful even just on the phone.  Are theseproblems recent or since birth? We saw the signs of reflux in two of ours way before 19 weeks, by then things were getting better.
TwoXChromosomes X Because otherwise i think it would be difficult to get takers, given the costs. Then you've got the whole issue of superior gestating environment...given that the majority of people seeking abortion do so because of poverty (as in a lack of access to contraception, sex education, resources to provide for the child etc), how else would you get people to take up the very expensive option?
BabyBumps X My water broke and I had little to no contractions... They finally augmented with pitocin 33 hours later. We had our daughter 3.5 hours later!  First baby was induced, and second went into labour naturally with contractions, water didn't break until delivery. 
TwoXChromosomes X I know if I had been, he would support my decision. When I talked to him earlier he told me, no matter what happens everything will be ok. He has 2 kids already, and he is a very good father.
TwoXChromosomes X You should be fine. As long as you keep the ring in for at least 21 days (and no more than 28!), and only keep it out for 7 days at the most, you're protected at all times. Doesn't matter whether you're actually bleeding when the ring's out or not. Also - the bleeding is due to the drop in hormones. Sometimes it can take your body a few days to register that drop, which is why the bleeding may not start as soon as you take the ring out.
BabyBumps X I was also within 10 minutes from the hospital, at my mom's, when I realized that I had to go RIGHT THEN! My situation was totally crazy though - just got off 3 months strict bedrest, having contractions for past 3 months or more, and already 5cm/90%effaced the day before - but not in active labor due to meds and bedrest. So, I am sure we cannot really compare our situations. Thank goodness for your sake. haha!  But, with my first pregnancy, I was in labor for SIX DAYS at the hospital, while they did everything short of killing me to keep baby in. Therefore, with your experience and with mine, I conclude that no matter what amount of time you are in labor, it is a totally crazy experience ;-).  I wish you quick labor...but not too quick!! Are you going to have an epidural? That is one reason you don't want it to go TOO quickly. They didn't have time to give me ANY meds - not even for group B strep - which really scared me.
BabyBumps X Interesting...I haven't heard of that possible connection. However, there were questions about whether the abruption caused my pre-term labor and delivery. They said that they didn't think so, because I wasn't losing a lot of blood until closer to delivery. (I was asked several times if there had been trauma to my belly though, which there had not.) Although, I believe I have read that you can have an abruption and there is not necessarily major hemmoraging at first. Who knows?!?! So much is uncertain in Obstetrics. Honestly, because it was discovered that I had a shortened cervix and was already contracting at 24 weeks with baby #2, I think the preterm labor and abruption were unrelated, or at least that the abruption did not cause the preterm labor. I feel like the epidural is pretty safe, although not always full effective, but that is of course just my feeling and opinion.  And yeah, I felt like a TOTAL BADASS!! That was the best part. hahaha! Good luck. I hope you can be a total badass too ;-)
TwoXChromosomes X I am willing to bet Planned Parenthood screens for other cancers as well, but funds being what they are when a huge source of funding is cut off resources must be shifted to cover costs.  [Looks like i was right.]( -topics/womens-health/ovarian-cancer-30086.htm)
TwoXChromosomes X I didn't have a period for four months. I was flipping out- but everything turned out fine. Not pregnant...but they think it could be endometriosis :( 
TwoXChromosomes X satisfying a woman with hands &amp; tongue is not the same thing as satisfying her with a penis, in terms of male ego as well as closeness.   kama sutra... have to read that at some point i guess.... and its not the first time i come across it in an interesting context
TwoXChromosomes X I fold mine in half by pushing at the top edge of the outside. It creates a sort of point that makes it way easier to go in. When it is in, I sort "screw" it up in a circle until it feels comfortable.
BabyBumps X And your body is producing more vaginal discharge at this point in your pregnancy.  I'm overdue, and I have had braxton hicks (all through 3rd trimester, but increasing as time goes on), discharge, achy pelvis - all of that.  The pain in the hips/pelvis has been the baby engaging - or moving down into my pelvis - and that started about 2 weeks ago.  I am still in a holding pattern... just waiting for my little dude to make his appearance.   My midwife told me yesterday that unless it's hard to talk or taking my breath away, anything I think might be contractions probably are not.
TwoXChromosomes X Here's another reason for the cup.  If I overestimate the amount of bleeding I am going to do, and use a too absorbent tampon, I get to scrape my insides with dry cotton when it is time to remove it. 
BabyBumps X It's too bad the gummy kind didn't work out for you. I love my gummy prenatals and they have DHA in them (Vitafusion from Target). They don't have iron though so I'm alternating taking them with a regular horse-pill type prenatal.
TwoXChromosomes X No, Planned Parenthood, as I'm sure you've heard, is funded mostly by donations and partnerships with women's health organizations. In some states, there is funding to reduce/eliminate costs of certain services, but Planned Parenthood on it's own does not have the funding to offer free services. Without additional state help, most services are in the 100-900 range... at least, that's the case in our affiliate.  
BabyBumps X Just wondering if you have ever experienced food aversion or constant, unrelenting nausea for weeks at a time?  I know I have and am, although it is much improved, there were times when toast was all I could keep down. It's not fair to judge. And I seriously doubt that very many women feel IMMUNE from being responsible once they are expecting. Many of us lose sleep from the amount of responsibility we feel by growing a human!
TwoXChromosomes X But vasectomies are easily reversible, so I don't see the doctor's logic. We have a health professor at my university who has had his vasectomies reversed twice, and had children twice. The third time was "for good". It's an extremely simple procedure.
TwoXChromosomes X Seriously. The random terrible cramps that I get out of no where that only last a few seconds are SO much better than the terrible cramps I would get for three days every month plus the five (total) day period.   Oh, and my boobs don't hurt as much. They shrank to an almost average size.  Mirena is my best buddy.
AskWomen X Thanks, this sounds like the best advice. It's a shame how many people are misinformed about HPV and don't have the vaccine. While the large majority of cases are asymptomatic, many statistics say over 80% of people will get a strain of genital HPV in their lifetime. How easy would it be to reduce that chance by simply getting the vaccine?  I already have HPV and even I'm getting the vaccine so that I cant get HPV-6, 16, or 18.
TwoXChromosomes X i used to be unsure what i was, abortion just seemed so, well, repulsive to me. But eventually i realized the debate wasn't about  what i would or wouldn't want to do in the situation, it was about whether that decision should be made by individuals or the government.  I realized i could still be against abortion personally, but support the rights of other to decide what is best for them.
TwoXChromosomes X You could potentially have polycystic ovarian syndrome that the pill was controlling. One of the symptoms is hair loss, and the pill is one of the main treatments.
TwoXChromosomes X Haha, it's a bit tricky to explain without making sense but to insert, I fold the cup and hold it firmly with my index finger and thumb, and just stick my fingers in as deep as I can and release the cup. I try to have my fingers in contact with my vagina rather than the cup because that gives me a better feel of what's where, rather than trying to go by what my vagina's feeling (my ladyparts only recognise two stimuli; pleasure and pain. Not useful when trying to carefully place a silicone cup inside you :P). After it's open and inside me I grab the bottom of the cup and spin it around a bit to make sure it's settled nicely around the cervix.  As for removing, I again grab the base of the cup and pull it out until I can actually feel things are getting a bit tight down there, then tilt the base of the cup towards your clit while pulling down so that the wide rim comes out from the butt side of the vaginal entrance. If I do it the other way around so the rim brushes again my labia/urethra it just feels uncomfortable and might scathe the skin. Anyway, if you do it like that you'll end up dumping all the contents of the cup straight in the toilet with minimal mess.  Sorry if that made no sense. That's something I've learned to do over years of using the cup, it wasn't something I just figured out from the get go. My general advice would be to relax and not give up, it's worth the effort when you do get comfortable with it. :) I honestly couldn't imagine having a period without a menstrual cup any more.
BabyBumps X So, not to tick you off more, but why aren't you just taking over the counter prenatals? My doctor told me what to look for in the vitamin and took whatever worked for me.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;nor would many people agree that a woman shouldn't have control over her reproductive abilities, and hence, her overall freedom as an individual.  This is going to actually be an issue, eventually. The way abortion statute is currently written, if there's a way to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the fetus would be viable outside of the womb, performing an abortion will then constitute murder.   There's something a lot of people don't really want to admit to, but it's almost undeniably true: a newborn infant is not as valuable as a fully-formed human over a year old. Babies don't even have anything close to what we could call sentience. They have not lived, they do not have anything that particularly makes them anything indistinguishable from any other infant. They are valuable because they are potential.   The most strident supporter of abortion would probably not think twice about sacrificing their bodies if it meant a loved one could be saved. 
TwoXChromosomes X My doc let me get one too, even though I've never had kids. That was about 5 years ago, and now I hear there's a smaller one being marketed (soon?) to women who haven't had children. I would have liked a smaller one, since my uterus protested vehemently for about 4 months. Getting ready to have it replaced, so maybe I'll get the smaller one if it's available.
BabyBumps X You're not alone, for the past week or so the little bit of energy I'd gotten back since my first trimester has waned.  If it wasn't for the "guilt" of feeling like I'm wasting a perfectly good day, I'd lay in bed all day and be done with it :P    Here's an article on fatigue during pregnancy with some tips that I found helpful: _fatigue-during-pregnancy_2911.bc
Parenting X My daughter was kept in the hospital with fluctuating levels of newborn Jaundice (now we know it was just breast milk jaundice -_-;;) for her first 8 days. After that she went every where with us, mall, grocery shopping, etc.
BabyBumps X Yay on not taking the epidural! I was induced with my first, the only downside for me was the pitocin made my contractions really intense. I regretted getting the epidural,  I felt like it made it hard to push,  Good luck and congrats!
TwoXChromosomes X I feel obligated to say that you ideally go to the doctor as UTIs can develop into dangerous kidney infections.  Certainly do so immediately if there is blood in your urine or other serious symptoms.  That said, I've had 3 UTIs in my life and I've gotten rid of all of them by just drinking tons of water and cranberry juice (unsweetened if you can find it).  
TwoXChromosomes X Drink lots of water, take vitamin C (something about making your urine more acidic should help).  If it gets worse, go buy some AZO pills.  Actually, every woman should always have AZO pills.  They're the ones that turn your urine bright orange, but eliminate the pain.
TwoXChromosomes X i've had my cup for almost 5 years and it changed my life (and stopped putting dioxin from pads and tampons into my vagina!) are you sure you have the right size? typically the ones labeled A inside are for women who have had kids. B is for ladies who haven't. A is bigger and would likely be more painful to wear if you haven't had kids.  folding the cup in half works best for me. i fold it and hold it between my thumb and forefinger. like @teatoly mentioned, if you sit back on the toilet (far enough to get your whole hand comfortably in the toilet bowl) it's much easier to navigate the cup.  i start by setting the cup just inside my vaginal opening (it's folded the whole time). then i use my fingers to pull and push the cup to help it open up. sometimes i have to pull it almost all the way out. sometimes i have to do it a couple times before it works.  usually it makes a slurping sound (especially fun in public bathrooms! and maybe you get to have a conversation about cups and spread the knowledge!), but then it pops open. i also jiggle the stem of the cup to help it get situated in a way that feels like it's not even in. this is important because positioning correctly can mean no spills vs. spills (spills still happen to me, so don't worry) once it's open and set, i push it in maybe 4 inches with my forefinger and middle finger.  voila! period success :)  don't be afraid to get in there and wiggle around. you won't hurt anything and you'll feel like a champ! 
BabyBumps X i think it all comes down to how badly you want to experience natural labor vs. how worried you are about the risks of VBAC. it sounds to me like you're pretty okay with the idea of not having a natural birth, in which case you absolutely should not feel guilty about scheduling a c-section. if that's what you want, and what you feel is safest for you and your baby, then go for it! however, if you feel like you're being pressured to choose another c-section because you've had one before, but you still want to experience natural labor/birth, then try for the VBAC. if it fails, at least you know you made every attempt at the birth you wanted before resorting to what was necessary. 
TwoXChromosomes X Was she drunk? If not, there's a case here of serious malpractice in her ethics class. To show an abortion is one thing, to show a doctored video with sound effects is quite another.  It's possible she was shown a late stage abortion, as these can and do happen in extreme cases- but usually if the baby is dead. And if the foetus is not dead (I'm not entirely sure on the reasons for late stage abortions) one would imagine medical ethics state that the foetus is injected with a lethal dose of something before the dissection begins.   This (my ignorance as well as you friends') is the reason I support separating science and religious education. 
BabyBumps X It is your decision as a mother. No one can tell you different.  If it was me, I'd attempt a VBAC especially if I planned on more children since continued repeat C-sections just up your risks for several things. Plus for me at least if I ended up with a c-section again, at least I said I tried.
Parenting X As a 2 time Mother, with a husband who has said beautiful things through 2 pregnancies, I can't stress enough how important it is to just keep saying these things.   It's a long hard road after childbirth, to think that we are actually sexy is hard to believe at first.  But I promise that if you say it long enough, we will believe it.
BabyBumps X I ended up having a c section as well. Though I had no doula I too was excited to really use my lady balls and have this baby! Bit it was not to be. Induced over the course of three days and my body did zero. I dialated enough for them to break the water so I end up with a c section. I also had a smooth recovery and breastfed. Now I am pregnant again and I am also thinking of just going for a c section. My family seems disappointed but to appease them I said I will go 2 weeks past. If my body doesn't do it on its own then c section it is. Why would I go through all that terrible inducing stuff again. No thanks.   TL;DR a c section was like your labour and birth. It is what you know. What matters is the baby in your arms at the end. 
TwoXChromosomes X I would see a different doctor!   My gyno actually recommended the IUD to me while I was prodding him about other forms of BC. I didn't want to ask him directly because I have heard that many gynos are against young women having the IUD. He said it would be a great idea for me since I have zero interest in having children any time soon. I have had too many problems with the pill and the ring, and condoms.   
TwoXChromosomes X I had the Mirena inserted because I have terrible, terrible periods. Vomiting, excruciating pain, the whole 9 yards. I am also not a fan of hormonal contraceptives, but I feel "normal" again on the Mirena. My sex drive came back and I'm no longer psycho like I felt on BC pills. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm in my early 20's and I was easily able to get an IUD. I did not have to convince a doctor. I asked for it and she made an appointment. Also, with IUD's, you should want an experienced doctor. If your doctor is misinformed or inexperienced, she probably won't know what she's doing and the procedure could be painful. Find an experienced OB/GYN and ask them if they have inserted many IUD's. I asked my doctor how many IUD's she's inserted and she said "hundreds".  Does the UK have women's clinics? You might have a better chance at a place specifically designed to give women access to birth control. I got my Paraguard IUD at Planned Parenthood. Best decision ever.
TwoXChromosomes X I was Depo for almost 3 years and loved it. The only side effects that I had from it were the fact that I bled though the first 2 shots (up to 3 is normal) and that my period stopped compleatly after that. It's supposedly really hard on your reproductive system but my fertility returned as soon as I stopped the shots.  
TwoXChromosomes X I also had this problem. It's the only reason I went off after 4 years. Once you gain it, it's incredibly hard to shed while still on Depo. Weight gain aside, Depo was great. No periods, no forgetting pills. I didn't have any emotional side effects, either.
TwoXChromosomes X I got mine in last week and I have a LOW tolerance for pain. I took 4 Advil an hour beforehand. The 30 seconds it took to get shoved it there were bad, I can't lie, but everything else was a cakewalk (I'm used to cramps so...it was just like a regular period). My gyno was just happy I didn't kick her (like I did when I got a colposcopy...now THAT was pain). 5 days later, I'm on my period, but no additional cramping. 
BabyBumps X I was just going to put a pad on while I labored if it had broken early on. With my oldest, my water broke and then labor started. With this one, the water broke 2 minutes before he arrived so I was on the chux pads. 
AskWomen X Low-risk HPV is responsible for genital warts, not cancer.  High-risk HPV is responsible for cancer, not genital warts.  If he does not have any visible warts, then no, they actually cannot test him for HPV (HPV testing is not available for males).  
AskWomen X Sorry, thats not correct.  While low risk are associated with warts and high risk are associated with cancer, both are able to enter latency.  In latency no outward signs of infection (i.e. warts) are generally detectable, but the virus is still there and it's DNA can still be detected.  If no warts are currently visible, he can go to his physician and have them take samples from where the warts used to be (even if there are none visible there are the moment).  If they still find HPV DNA in those samples, he has not cleared infection.  edit: in the interest of full disclosure, I will tell you that I am an Immunologist.  I also have worked on/currently work on vaccines and therapies for both low risk and high risk HPV
BabyBumps X For her? Practically nothing. Maybe entertainment (a book or a phone, but not too much as you'll be very focused on baby), and basic toiletries. Our hospital even provided some Chapstick! You don't really need to bring much because they supply it all. For him it's a different story. Several changes of clothes, the camera, phones and chargers, a pillow, toiletries, snacks, entertainment, a couple pairs socks and underwear, and maybe an extra blanket, etc. there was a point where I actually had to have someone go out and get me an extra pair of jeans because I only thought to bring the pair I was wearing + an extra set. Also soap and shampoo.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah you can have a false negative with a pregnancy test, but you can never have a false positive, unless you had an incredibly rare HCG secreting tumor which is a whole other pile of problems. 
BabyBumps X Just give it a few weeks!  My husband discovered that our baby responds to his voice, so he loves talking to my belly.  I get to enjoy the little juggernaut's head ramming into my internal organs in order to get closer to daddy's voice.  My baby is also"ticklish," so when I show my husband where a  little foot or elbow is, he can press lightly on my belly and chase the little foot or elbow all over the place as the baby tries to escape from his/her trolldad.  By the third trimester you may notice hints of a personality starting to form!
TwoXChromosomes X The problem is that the people who oppose Planned Parenthood don't care about preventing unplanned pregnancies, which means they'll never go to bat for contraception or sex education. In their minds, an unplanned pregnancy isn't regrettable but rather is the foreseeable and appropriate punishment for sexual activity. As a result, reducing unplanned pregnancies would only remove that punishment and increase the real problem, which is that people are having sex at all.
TwoXChromosomes X ...personally, I think that it's pretty discomforting for someone to breastfeed in public. You don't need to whip it out. You can pump at home and bring a bottle along with when you go out.  /personal opinion.
BabyBumps X I hear you.  I go back to work in mid-March, thinking about it breaks my heart.  My 8 weeks (2 weeks of vacation &amp; 6 weeks of short term disability) of leave is just not enough time!  Of course, I could take up to 4 months off, but anything extra (outside of my vacation &amp; disability) is unpaid.  I just can't afford it.
BabyBumps X YES! You will learn so much. If having less intervention is important to you, then take it. I have heard from so many women who didn't prepare / educate themselves ("I figured I'd just read up on my own and tell them I didn't want drugs, but I had no idea how to handle all that I came up against and wished I'd prepared better").   For me, it is also about getting my husband to focus for 2 hours a week for 12 weeks to learn about what we'll be going through (I'm doing a Bradley course).  Good luck!  
BabyBumps X Congrats! My twins are 7 weeks old now and it's AWESOME. The pregnancy was exhausting and painful towards the end, but totally worth it. And having two babies is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be (but I feared for the worst!)
BabyBumps X We saw the yolk sac, a little tiny dot of a baby, and we were able to see the heartbeat, which was totally unexpected.  The doctor told us it was pretty early to see the heartbeat, so don't be too frightened if you don't!  We were really just making sure the pregnancy wasn't ectopic at the six week scan.
TwoXChromosomes X I adore mine. Getting it replaced in 7 months after an awesome 4.5 years of no problems and no mentionable periods.
BabyBumps X Mine measured 6 weeks and 5 days when we had the first ultrasound.  We got to see a little snowman-shaped blob and a heartbeat!
TwoXChromosomes X I wear a thin panty liner afterwards that I can change when it gets um.. gooey. This helps with both the smell and keeping any moisture related issues away.
TwoXChromosomes X Of course. I just mentioned the downvoting thing so people would stop just because they disagree with you. I think it's important that people are exposed to rational pro-lifers, so they can hear both sides of the argument.  I get what you're saying. The reason I'm pro-choice is because I see fetuses as (excuse the negative-connotation of this language; I mean it in a strictly definition sort of way) tumors or growths on a woman's body. It may have the potential for rational thought, but until it is capable of surviving without the mother's life-blood, it isn't a human being, and it's a woman's right to choose what she wants to do with it.
TwoXChromosomes X it may be genetically human, but i just can't look at that 5-week picture and say "yeah, that's a person." that's a blob of tissue that will *eventually* be a person, but at that particular stage it's no different to me than a blood clot.
TwoXChromosomes X The pro-life crowd is the one using "clever rhetoric". Pro-choice is literally pro choice, "pro-life" is literally anti choice.
TwoXChromosomes X Does this include simply keeping fertilized eggs from implanting? Like say, Plan B?
TwoXChromosomes X If I were absolute ruler of America, I would make abortions illegal except in cases of rape and incest or if the mother's life was in danger. The mothers would be free from punishment, but doctors who preformed abortions would have their licences taken away.
TwoXChromosomes X There is a developing human life inside a developed human life.  The issue is human rights, of which we need to protect a woman's right to her body.  This right of hers is to remove the fetus from her body.  It might not necessarily be her right to determine the life of the fetus, but that is the inevitable result of her inherent right to remove it from her body.  It's not about a pragmatic approach of the downfalls of prohibition, it's about human rights, and anything that ignores the woman's rights to her body is misogyny. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think it is more lazy, ham-fisted, and underhanded to support the labels as being "pro-life vs pro-choice." "Pro-life" just feeds into the rhetoric that pro-life people support a baby's life and "pro-choice" people are inherently against that baby's life. They want that baby dead. The "pro-life" term is important to the movement because it reinforces the whole "good vs evil" nonesense.
TwoXChromosomes X the difference is that one could survive outside of the uterus, and one couldn't. What is so difficult to understand about that?  A neonate is a separate, distinct person. A fetus is not as it is INSIDE another person, and is entirely dependant on that one, specific person to be alive. Without consent, the fetus is using that one, specific person's body against that person's will - something that has never been a right of any born person, ever. Why would you give a fetus the right to do that then take away that right once they are born - or do we all have the right to other people's bodies by force?
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;These terms set the debate as one between those who are pro-choice (support the ability to choose) and those who are anti-choice (are against the abilty to choose).  The very act of framing the debate that way is pro-choice-centric.  &gt;Of all the binary splits, pro-choice/anti-choice is the most accurate, as it summarises the two stances neatly; both sides have impassioned arguments as to why this choice should/shouldn't be available.  It comes solely from the perspective of the pro-choicer, though. Choice is the main point for the pro-choicer because they don't consider the fetus to be alive. Life is the main point for the pro-lifer because they do. It would be like calling the argument for gun control "An argument about whether or not you want America to be crime-free" or "An argument about whether or not you want America to be a land of freedom."  &gt;should medically induced abortion be a legal service or shouldn't it?  The only reason why we have the terms "pro-life vs. pro-choice" is because both sides are so impassioned about their positions. Which is why we don't have similar identifying terms for other political issues like "pro-safety vs. pro-freedom" or "pro-helping the poor vs. pro-letting you do what you want with your hard earned money."   Those kinds of rhetorical devices are used *in* their respective arguments, but they aren't used as the names *for* their respective arguments.
TwoXChromosomes X Absolutely. Also, if you or your SO are worried about the risk of forgetting / taking the first pill late, you can reduce the placebo week to 4 days or skip it entirely if you don't mind not having withdrawal bleeding. It increases the efficiency as if you forget to start the new pack on time, you still have 3 days of protection. It's possible and safe on all pills, although it works most smoothly with monophasic pills (the ones where all 21 pills have the same dosage.)
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, there are plenty of pro-choice individuals who absolutely recognize that a fetus is a living thing, but who don't believe that it is at a developmental stage that makes ending its life equivalent to murder. In addition, there are clearly times in late-stage abortions where the fetus is sacrificed to save the mother's life where pro-choicers recognize that it is a living organism and one that resembles a human being, but that doesn't make its life more valuable than that of the woman carrying it, who should be able to make the choice to save her own life by terminating the pregnancy. I think your characterization of pro-choice advocates is a little off. It truly is about choice, not about the definition of life. 
BabyBumps X With my first, I was convinced it was a girl! Maybe some wishful thinking on my part, and other people telling me what they thought. It was a boy, and I was totally shocked when I found out at the ultrasound. So much for mother's intuition. Ha! I wouldn't even guess with the second one. Oh, and I carried low with both a boy and a girl. No truth in that superstition ;-).  Isn't there one about a girl having a faster heart rate? I'm sure there is no truth in it, but I will admit that my girl's heart rate was indeed faster than my boy's.  Go figure!
TwoXChromosomes X I have paragaurd and I have had it for about 4 months now. The process of getting it in is slightly uncomfortable but if you relax as much as possible that will help it go faster. The real pain comes in a few hours later. I had debilitating cramps that lasted about 3 days. During that time and for about 2 months afterwards I had spotting to light blood flow, but not a full on period. I actually didn't get my first period with it till last month. It was heavy flow with bad cramps (though definitely not as bad as when it was put in), but my period only lasted about four days. This may have had something to do with the fact that I was on hormonal birth control for a year before I had my IUD put in.  Overall even with the terrible cramping I love the IUD. It's simple and very low maintenance. You just have to check the strings every so often and make sure the bottom of it isn't poking out of your cervix. The risk of it falling out decreases dramatically after the first month. That's the only time you really have to worry about it.  I would also recommend getting the strings shortened because it might be uncomfortable for your boyfriend even after the strings soften up, which takes a few weeks or so. Depending on the positions you use during he might be able to not feel them at all or feel like he's being stabbed. This is based on feedback I've received from my boyfriend.  I highly recommend getting the paraguard IUD. The cramps aren't terrible if you know how to deal with them. I usually go for a heating pad, raspberry leaf tea, and about 600 mg of ibuprofen. 
BabyBumps X Yeah, I was freaked out too when I saw my test, even though I was trying for it. I don't think any woman is ever ready, and it's rly normal to just be freaked out more than anything for a while. *HUGS* You'll work it all out. The people who love you will be there for you when you need it. And I know you might hate me, but congratulations! A baby is really a wonderful thing, even if-like me-you have bouts of panic about it ever so often. Try imagining what your baby will look like, it will probably help you see it as your baby and not just some baby. (: Also, you can always buy ur hubby an expectant father book to help him prepare for it. Will pray for the best for your family! 
TwoXChromosomes X Your statement that they believe that it isn't equivalent to murder and that it merely "resembles" a human being adds to my point.  Pro-lifers believe that the life of the fetus is 100% equivalent to the life of the mother. As you just illustrated, pro-choicers do not believe that.  Indeed, many pro-lifers believe something similar to what you're describing. There are those that think that abortion should be illegal except in cases of rape and incest or in cases where it would compromise the life of the mother, suggesting that the life of the mother is, at least in certain situations, more important than the life of the fetus. Are they "anti-choice"?
BabyBumps X Dilation can happen so slow that you have no idea that it's even happening. I only dilated to a 2 before I went into labor but everyone is different. My sister in law walked around dilated to a 3 or 4 about 2 weeks before my niece was born. You are not comfortable at the end and maybe that's why you don't notice your cervix changing.
TwoXChromosomes X Mid twenties, never been pregnant, I got Mirena in November 2011.  Insertion was uncomfortable but not awful. I had cramping/spotting on and off for a month and a half. I haven't had a period since I got it inserted.  My obgyn curled the strings up into my cervix so they aren't an issue. I was also told that the strings soften over time. So my significant other and I haven't had any issues with the strings.  I went with mirena over paraguard because I didn't want my periods to get any heavier, my hematologist told me in some cases it can make periods worse.  
TwoXChromosomes X You might want to double up!  Not like two condoms, but some combo of condom, pill, spermicidal egg, diaphragm, and trying stuff other than PIV.
TwoXChromosomes X Is not getting a period with Mirena common? I'm currently on Yasmin, but I take 4 packs of pills in a row before stopping because I get *awful* migraines when on my period. If I wouldn't get any periods with Mirena, I would definitely consider switching to this when I go back later this year.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think it's "always" rude to ask someone their number. If you are going into a sexual relationship with someone, I think you need to be aware of at least the basics about their sexual history. Did they use protection with all of their partners? Any of those partners have an STD? Have they been tested? Have they been treated? I think the "number" does play a role there. I wouldn't just ask "anyone," but I definitely asked my SO before we started sleeping together. 
TwoXChromosomes X Fuck pads. I seriously can't use pads unless it's an absolute emergency. I worry about leakage, my junk gets all squishy, I basically can't move without feeling terrible.  Tampons, man. You pop one in and it takes care of everything for you. You feel clean and you can do any fucking thing you want without even having to take your period into consideration. Tampons. Are. Brilliant.
BabyBumps X I drank occasionally when I was pregnant too, don't worry! I had a glass of wine at my mom's birthday and my own, and a bottle of Fruli (strawberry beer) occasionally too. I hear in the UK the recommended limit is 2 units per day (so 2 glasses of wine or a pint of beer) so I felt totally safe with 1 unit every month or so. I got unbelievable hate for mentioning it on a pregnancy forum though. One douchebag actually told me that she hoped my baby would get FAS to "teach [me] a lesson."
BabyBumps X I've always had a bad sense of smell, but my sense of smell suddenly got REALLY good. I was more tired than I've ever been in my life, and I felt nauseous all day every day. All I wanted to do was sit on the couch and be miserable. 
BabyBumps X &gt;not to drink even a sip because it's been proven that even little bits of alcohol can cause FAS or other problems.  yes, you DID claim that minimal to moderate drinking causes FAS and apparently has been "proven" to do so though in reality it has been *proven* not to through two different 5-year long studies which ended in 2010.
BabyBumps X How far along is she exactly? What number baby is this for her? I've had friends who had their baby drop 3-4 weeks before labor (first baby), but if this is her second time around it may be shorter then that. But IMHO with these things you really can't tell, there is no guarantee unless you are actually in active labor/water breaks. Everything else can happen minutes before labor starts, or weeks (months!) later. 
BabyBumps X They covered the insurance stuff, so what is worrying your right now:  Those worries are totally normal, but know that something actually being wrong is nowhere near as common as going on to have a healthy baby. Odds are in your favor.  And as for worrying about the disappearing symptoms, don't! Those symptoms will come an go throughout your entire pregnancy. Some days will be terrible. Some days you will feel great. Sometimes it will go back and forth between the two several times per day.   As long as you aren't having severe cramping or bleeding, you can take a deep breath and assume all is well. (Some cramping is normal, a lot is going on down there, but *severe* cramping requires an emergency room visit)
BabyBumps X There was actually a new study in 2010 based on 18,500 children that pretty clearly showed that light drinking is not dangerous, and "having one or two drinks a week while pregnant could actually give your kids a slight developmental advantage."  "It is no longer valid to argue that we don't know enough about low-dose drinking during pregnancy or that the known effects of binge drinking may penetrate to low-dose drinkers somehow," he added. "There is no detectable risk associated with light or moderate drinking during pregnancy." -drinking-pregnant-women.html
BabyBumps X I haven't slept longer than 45 minutes at a time for the past 2 weeks or so (due to having to pee, acid reflux, nightmares, general uncomfortableness and on and on ...)  I'm at the point of losing my mind.  So yes, I feel your pain.  Only 9 weeks left.  
TwoXChromosomes X I am suggesting that it's unlikely those records are available for the public, so there is no way for *you* to know how far along a woman is in pregnancy when she has an abortion, therefore no way for you to make a judgment on the subject.  And there would be more women pregnant without contraception, therefore it would be highly, highly likely there would be more abortion if there were more women getting pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X Getting pregnant unexpectedly can be scary...but it sounds like you can do it.  I raised my little sister and my brother finished high school while living with me until I was 20.  When I did get pregnant later, it was still a little daunting.  But it was absolutely worth it for me, and a lot changed after she was born.  It puts a lot of life into perspective, and you have a different idea of what is important.    Most of all, you have 9 months to adjust to this new time.  That is really a long time (trust me).  So, don't make any rash decisions right now.  Do what *you* need to do.  If you want to keep your baby, then there are lots of ways for you to get help and assistance in order to make sure that you are mentally and financially able to raise your child.  It's not the hardest thing in the world, and if you already love your baby now...you're going to love him/her even more when he/she is in your arms.  I would suggest doing what is important for you.  I have a couple friends who gave their first child up for adoption when they were younger, and they still regret it.  So, that's my two cents :)
TwoXChromosomes X Ack the same thing happened to me from when I began my period at 12 until I was 14, I actually didn't think anything of it but I got my appendix removed then had some complications and needed an ultrasound. It turns out I had a bunch of cysts that were causing the problem. Maybe that's your issue too? It sounds exactly the same as what happened with me, I would get LONG and heavy periods, then I wouldn't get another one for up to 6 months.
TwoXChromosomes X It hurt the same amount coming out, but for a shorter duration of time for me.  I had the same problem with invisible strings.  They once did an ultrasound because they couldn't see it with the speculum (the strings were too short), and they thought it might have fallen out.
TwoXChromosomes X Skip the tampons and go straight to a reusable cup like the Diva Cup or a disposable cup like the SoftCup. No risk of TSS and a much better alternative overall--you can wear it up to 12 hours, it's super comfortable (no dry wad of cotton shoved up your vagina!), and both are great for sex (no PIV with the diva though), traveling and exercise. Many women report less cramping and shorter periods, which I found the case.   I daresay the cup made shark week downright tolerable.
TwoXChromosomes X TSS is much less likely if you only keep them in for the recommended amount of time.  That being said, I still sleep in them and wear them longer on lighter days than you are supposed to and I have never had a problem.  I started with the tampax pearl lights, I think they are in a purple wrapper.  They are smaller and are a little more forgiving about getting them to fit without feeling them.  A tip though, if you can feel it, take it out and try again.  I had a friend who refused to use them because she put it in wrong once and thought that was how it was supposed to feel.  Once I made the switch I was so happy, because I always had issues with pads.
TwoXChromosomes X tampax pearl is super comfy.  yeah, when I left my tampon in overnight when I was still new to using tampons, I started to get dizzy and feel very weird.  Definitely make sure to change it like every 3-4 hours in the beginning.  And wear a pad.  Is your flow super heavy or kinda...normal?
TwoXChromosomes X Sorry for the hostility from wibble, maybe (s)he is having an off day.  Anyway, I have the paragard and I. Love. It.  Insertion went smoothly for me, I cramped and spotted for a few days after. For a few weeks after, I'd get mega-cramps when lifting heavy shit (like furniture for my then-job), but they subsided with rest.  My periods are a day or two longer, but are no more frequent, no more crampy, and no heavier than what I started with. I have pretty nasty periods naturally and if anything paragard has kinda helped (TMI: less clots).  Anyway, nothing can beat being OFF HORMONES. That's the reason I got it and I will never go back. Plus, 10 years of contraception!?!?!?   Awwww yee
TwoXChromosomes X I use the tampax with the cardboard applicator. Takes a second to get used to but I like that the wrapper and applicator can be flushed and are biodegradable along with the tampon.   Toxic shock used to be a problem because of the materials used in tampons. But since this was discovered, manufacturers changed materials and the risk is much much lower.   I read somewhere once that men and women are both susceptible to TSS, women are slightly more susceptible on their period, and then it's sometimes associated with tampon use. So the risk is very minimal. If you're concerned, just make sure you don't leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours.   Just make sure to get one with an applicator because it's much much easier to insert, and if it hurts or feels weird when you stand up, try pushing it in further or taking it out and starting over.   I made the switch from pads to tampons when I was visiting a friend for a week and got my period and she only had tampons. I have never once looked back. 
TwoXChromosomes X Follow the directions. TSS is unlikely if you don't wear them longer than recommended and don't wear a tampon for a heavier flow than what you need.   I don't generally wear tampons, mostly because I never really got into the habit I think (I use ultra-light long or overnight pads. They work well for me, so I can move around more without leaks than with a regular length but also don't feel like I'm wearing a diaper like a maxi). I found the ones with the plastic applicator by far the easiest to insert, so I'd recommend starting with those. 
BabyBumps X I wish my nausea with my first ended at 16 weeks. My nausea with my first lasted the ENTIRE pregnancy. It drove me nuts.  As to your reddit flair. I'm going to guess you're having a boy. :3 random guess.
BabyBumps X 1st baby at 39w2d. I was measuring right on time, however an ultrasound at 34 weeks showed my man was already 6+lbs. I didn't have any signs when I was going into labor however. My cervix was back and totally closed in the morning, my water broke that night and I delivered by 4pm the next day.   I loved being in labor, honestly =]    It was all so exciting and awful at the very same time. 
TwoXChromosomes X Ugh I can never find a box of the tampax pearl lights only but these are the best. They're easier to put in, you don't need to go into weird positions on the toilet to uh... get the right angle. I have light periods so the more absorbing ones hurt like hell. Or sometimes they give me worse cramps. Again, due to the light periods I leave tampons in for a while. I sleep in them and it's fine if you forget to take it out for a couple hours. Just don't... completely forget.
TwoXChromosomes X No, I think it's more the idea that same pregnancies are inherently not worth having, or some people shouldn't be allowed to exist; that it's a moral failing on the mother's part to carry a severely disabled child to term.  I wouldn't say people *like* it, but many, many people clearly believe that an abortion is the choice you should make, possibly be even forced to make, because people with disabilities are "a drain on the system".  If I found out my fetus had down syndrome, I would not abort. I don't even plan to get that tested because I really don't care. But the idea that people could look at my child and actually believe they have the right to say, out loud, "Ugh, why did you give birth to that *thing*?" Well, fuck you very much, asswipe.
BabyBumps X Headaches! Not something people talk about often, and I know it doesn't happen to everyone but I've had a headache for the past 5 days straight and it's making me freaking MISERABLE! My mom got frequent headaches during her pregnancies too, and I made the mistake of googling and found some women basically have one long non-stop headache through their entire pregnancies. Nasty headache on top of morning sickness and extreme fatigue is NOT FUN AT ALL.
TwoXChromosomes X I think you may not know what Down Syndrome is. There are people (like my uncle) who have Down Syndrome and are still fully functioning members of society. They hold jobs, have relationships and hobbies, much like you or I. My uncle may not fill out his own taxes at the end of the year, but that doesn't make him a vegetable.  I don't know whether I would continue a pregnancy like that, and you have every right to decide not to carry a child with some kind of mental disability (or physical disability, or hair colour, or sex) to term. That still doesn't mean those lives are less valuable than a person with 'socially preferred' traits. I also don't necessarily think genetic engineering is necessarily a good thing.  However, you're coming off, intentionally or not, as acting as though women **should** abort a pregnancy of a child with a mental disability. You do not have the right to tell another woman what they should do with their uterus, or to tell them that their child's life is worth less.
BabyBumps X Honestly, I have only started to *feel* pregnant in the last week or so. I mean, I felt super queasy for the first trimester and just generally weird, but in the last week my abdomen has definitely started popping out and it's gotten hard and I'm not used to it! I keep pushing on it because it feels so strange. so I guess I actually feel pregnant now, even though you can't necessarily tell unless I'm wearing a tight shirt. but it's like a comfortable pregnant, not like what I imagine 3rd trimester will be like when I start to waddle around...hehe. so I will say 15 weeks for me!
TwoXChromosomes X Pumping keeps up your supply if you aren't breastfeeding regularly because you're separated from your baby (or if your baby can't feed directly from the boob for some reason) so you can't just "get ahead of it" on weekends because your milk production will go way down.  So basically, if you would be feeding your baby every 3 hours but you're away from your baby for 9 hours, you would pump 2 or 3 times in that time to keep your breasts producing at that level.  It takes about 15 minutes each time, depending on the pump you're using.    
BabyBumps X Kaiser has all sorts of classes that are available, at least in my area. They have prenatal classes, birthing classes, breastfeeding, infant CPR, etc. Have you looked into any of that? Sounds like you're pretty lucky in that you and baby are totally healthy. I agree with everyone else mentioning bringing a list. 
AskWomen X Two months; not quite sure why, as I hadn't changed anything regimental (to my knowledge). The added stress of potentially being pregnant may have prolonged it. Then again, I've always been irregular.   Needless to say, it came back with a vengeance (much to our relief) and the following cycles were hell, too.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had some terrible side effects from oral birth control in the past and have been doing very well with Implanon, which was very surprising to me.  My bleeding got SIGNIFICANTLY lighter (I have endometriosis) and the cramping is something I'm able to deal with now.  I haven't put on any weight.  I know a lot of people don't do well with it, but I really like it.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm overweight, and the ladies at my PP just had me switch to a pill with a slightly higher dosage.  I've been using BC pills ONLY for quite a while now (about 4 years with a 6 month try of depo in the middle), with no problems at all.   Weird. 
BabyBumps X I have one of those - one week later and I'm a different person!  I can walk again, thank god!  Luckily my SP is still ok but my SI joints are really loose :/  Must be careful!  My ob told me that if I overstretched my pelvic ligaments that it will never be right again.  Please look after yourself and I'll do the same :)
AskWomen X Yeah months. I used to have crazy irregular periods, 2 a month, none for 3 or 4 months, I had a 3 week period once. 
BabyBumps X With my last pregnancy I started getting morning sickness again around 30 weeks. It was on and off until 38 weeks, when it hit full force again :( Apparently it's not too uncommon because your hormones go a bit crazy again during those last couple weeks. 
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on the type of pill as to how crucial the window is. With progesterone pills (eg those with levonorgestrel) there's a 3-hour window for effectiveness (12 for Cerazette). For combined oral contraceptives, it's a little bit looser (I believe 12 hours). I've certainly never heard 30 minutes for either.
TwoXChromosomes X Pretty much anything. Alot of the ones that wreak havoc on your reproductive system when transmitted through genital contact will present as throat infections, like gonorrhea. Orally transmitted HPV increases chances of mouth or throat cancers. Syphilis is very easy to transfer orally. Herpes, obviously. HIV is very rare, but if the conditions are right it's possible to get it as the provider of oral since it's bodily fluids entering your mouth.   Being on the receiving end is typically safer, but some will persist and will infect your ladybits from an infected mouth.
AskWomen X You could abstain from sex completely during your fertile period, which is typically about 3 days. Or you could use condoms during the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and two days after just to cover your bases. Using the pull out method most of the time with fertility awareness isn't ideal, but it's definitely better than nothing! 
BabyBumps X I've actually used all my sick time up, and i think right now I have 3 days pay vacation saved up. Gotta love the USA
TwoXChromosomes X First, there is no approved test for men. If you know what strains you are infected with, you can figure out if the HPV vaccine will be of any use for him (ie. if you've already exposed him to strains 6, 11, 16 and 18 then Gardasil will be redundant). However, you shouldn't worry too much. HPV is quickly cleared in most cases (I forget the exact stats, but its the vast majority of them), and its only the cases where its persistent that you get genital warts/possible cancer, so he will most likely be fine (I'm assuming he is not immunocompromised).
BabyBumps X I don't plan on trying to cheat it, I just want to know how common it is to fail the first and pass the second. I'm already nervous about having a big baby b/c I'm small, and my birth weight was normal (7 10 I think), but my husband was on the big side, and I want to avoid getting induced or needing a c section
TwoXChromosomes X It's true, warts are not the cancer causing varieties, but they are really the only kind you can reliably test for in men.  That was my point. If he doesn't have warts it will be hard to test him. 
BabyBumps X I am only getting one. Between 18-20 weeks. I am anxious too, and have a few weeks until I get to that point. But I got to hear the heartbeat at my 10 week appointment, and that really reassured me!
BabyBumps X I had it. They first softened my cervix since, that is the part they start the night before. During this time try and sleep, although I was unable too because I was so anxious.. That took about 6 hours. Then they inserted the catheter. It was uncomfortable but you could still walk around. I had started contracting at this point. They tape this cord from the catheter to your leg and it is this motion that makes the catheter eventually pull out and your cervix is then at 3 cm. when that popped out they broke my water. That really got the contractions going. However my labor was not progressing at a very fast rate so they then gave me pitocin. It really is true that having one intervention leads to others. I also had magnesium which eventually stopped my labor and I ended up with a c section. If I could change anything it would be not to take the magnesium. I would be happy to answer any questions that you have! Good luck!
BabyBumps X A low lying placenta at this stage is not a crisis. The placenta can move away from the cervix as your uterus increases in size. My placenta is low lying but we could not determine on the ultrasound if it was covering my cervix. My OB suggested that we not do a transvaginal ultrasound as there was no point in worrying about something which could still correct itself. Luckily he didn't comment on cutting down on sex!
BabyBumps X I got a sonoline B doppler 3mhz, and could find the baby's heartbeat at around 9 weeks.   Nowadays though (last time I checked was 12 weeks, I'm now almost 14 weeks), I hear it for a little bit and then it fades--I'm guessing baby runs away from the doppler. I only check at most once a week.   My OB didn't even try hearing the heartbeat using their doppler at 11 weeks, saying I might not hear it.  Good luck if you do get one! :)
TwoXChromosomes X Mine's about $.90 ...per pill.   $1.20 per pill if you don't count the week of sugar pills.
TwoXChromosomes X It was in response to one of the horrible "any woman who wants an abortion will be forced to look at an ultrasound of the fetus" bills: it required any man seeking a Viagra prescription to get a colonoscopy.
AskWomen X it's been said, but definitely something menstrual.  she might not use tampons, (so check), but keeping a few pads on hand would make you the most amazing male friend to visit ever.  Sometimes even regular periods do surprising things, and though most women carry something with them for backup, at some point, everyone gets stuck.
Parenting X Can I at least get some recognition for four cords and an Apgar score of 9? I knew something was wrong and rushed to the hospital. Since he was in distress, they made the incision before the spinal took. My legs came up off the table, and I could feel the blood dropping down my hips. He's seven now, and I even had another (my daughter is four). 
BabyBumps X Given that she was completely healthy (other than jaundice) I am very grateful that she was as early as she was. She weighed in at 2.84Kg and 48cm (around 6 pounds 3~4 oz and 19 inches) So if she had of went full term she would have been one huge baby! I was only 7-ish pounds when I was born so i'm sure she takes after her dad who was 9.5 pounds. [Our little one]( ) a few days old :) 
TwoXChromosomes X This happened to me too. I was diagnosed with endo last year and had surgery back in September. Dont get me wrong, living with endo before surgery was painful.. but I am convinced it has gotten SO much worse after surgery. I'm currently looking for other doctors to get some more info, but as of right now I am in constant pain. Hope it gets better for you and that you have a fast recovery!
TwoXChromosomes X I've actually heard that the first period after laparoscopy is usually pretty bad. Some women say it gets better after that and some say it gets worse...  I had my laparoscopy two years ago and while the endometriosis did grow back in those two years and I still experience pain when I have my period it's not a constant everyday pain like before. I used to have abdominal pain daily, not it's more concentrated around the time I'm having my period.  Still, you should talk with your doctor and try and see what else you can do as far as pain management goes. Remember, there is no real cure for endometriosis out there, for many of us it really is just a lifetime of pain management. Maybe a change in diet will help or birth control or a different kind of pain medication even. Do some research and talk with your doctor about what might help you feel more comfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X I just want to make sure that everyone knows that you don't HAVE to see a gyno (specifically) to get a thorough pelvic exam.  If there are gyno problems that run in your family or you have particularly problematic periods (perhaps you OP)...then a gyno is definitely a good idea.  I have received pelvic exams and pap smears from a general practitioner (my family medicine doctor) that were professional and thorough.  He prescribed me birth control for years and we even had discussion on changing it with no problems.  Gyno's are great too!  But if you aren't having other issues, you don't necessarily NEED to see a gyno specifically.
TwoXChromosomes X Meh. Both men and women should have parental leave. Parents where I am from get to share 46 weeks of leave at 100% pay, or 56 weeks at 80%. There are clauses about how much both parties need to have worked for their parental leave, but the base line is that men are guaranteed 10 weeks after the birth while the woman is given three weeks before the birth and nine weeks post-birth.   The companies the parties work for are compensated by the government for the salary during the parental leave.   Most fathers I know have taken out 15-20 weeks to get to spend time with their babies. 
TwoXChromosomes X Your comment would have made sense if the story had been about a woman dying from an unwanted pregnancy.  Many pro-lifers are against abortion partly *because* they believe it is harmful to would-be mothers (even though with today's medically safe abortions, they'll talk more about psychological impacts).
AskWomen X No regulation besides whatever your usual is. It was weird when I first started using one, because I was used to the Pill, but it really just made me realise even more that HBC really fucks you up.  With my copper IUD, I haven't ever had a pregnancy scare. It has the same effectiveness, basically, [as a tubal litigation]( _with_copper#Mechanism_of_contraception_and_effectiveness).
TwoXChromosomes X That wasn't what the article was advocating necessarily. It said if you had a mishap, which implies a condom failure. The 25% rate is for couples having regular sex for an entire year and includes occasions when they have sex during the fertile window (since it's the actual use rate not the perfect use rate). If you have one accident during a time you are not in your fertile window the chances you will get pregnant are very slim.
TwoXChromosomes X Not to mention the life the forced born child would lead when the mother didn't want it for whatever reasons. 
TwoXChromosomes X Actually,  "heartbeat" of sorts is present pretty early on.  An early blood vessel contracts to move the blood like substance throughout the embryo in order to develop the muscles.  Though, there isn't really a "heart" at this point.  Eventually, the vessel folds over onto itself to create an atrium and ventricle, then other barriers form to create the 4 chambers.  So, by definition, it is a heartbeat.  That doesn't retract from the fact that the embryo is very underdeveloped and not sentient in the vast majority of abortions.
Parenting X Our baby had a fungal infection that was causing a bad eczema style rash like that, it sometimes weeped. It's all good now though we got some antifungal cream for her.  Definitely see a doc.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure why, but my mom told me not to EVER use monistat or vagisil for a yeast infection. I use a product called Aloe Vesta and it works really well for me. 
TwoXChromosomes X sounds like either an allergic reaction or maybe if you were scratching down there then using the monistat, perhaps that made it worse? when i have extreme itching or burning from using monistat (and none of my symptoms improve), that is usually a sign for me that i do not have a yeast infection but vaginosis. if you think it is herpes, i'd do a pap smear to test for any irregularities. you might still have vaginosis/yeast infection though so i'd go back to the doctor to double check on that.
BabyBumps X I assume you were pumping because you had to go back to work?  I didn't really pump that much, only a bottle here and there and I still got crazy engorged breasts, though that eventually went away first.  Breastmilk is always supply and demand, so if you're demanding alot (which it kind of sounds like you are), they're going to supply alot.  Maybe just try not to pump so much next time?
BabyBumps X Not to mention when the baby did nurse it was probably hard to get hindmilk since there was so much foremilk.  Their is really no need to pump so much. I went back to school full time when my girl was 3 weeks old. I pumped before/after class and now that I am gone for longer I take my pump and I pump when I'm at school, when I would normally be feeding her. Just make sure you pump at least 15 minutes on each breast to keep the supply even with what your baby would be taking. 
BabyBumps X Yep... kinda feel bad about it as well. I threw up maybe twice? And felt awesome afterwards. Only had mild nausea throughout my first trimester and not really any since... except when I eat too much, but that's always been the case not just since I got pregnant. Yeah, I'm more tired, but it's not enough to be a real issue. And I'm still not really showing (not enough that I look pregnant to strangers, but enough that friends can tell I'm bigger).  The only bit that's been sucky is my emotions. I've never been so out-of-control of them before, and it's a pain.  I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like I'm expecting to get HUGE in my third trimester and then hate life because I'll be so exhausted and sore all the time.
Parenting X Calcium interferes with iron absorption - maybe she was confused?  I don't give my kids vitamins but I had anemia while pregnant and I was instructed to not have any dairy products within 2 hours of taking my iron supplements. 
BabyBumps X I'm pretty pleased with how I've been feeling. For the most part I've been continuing my normal activities, I had minimal morning sickness (I can count on one hand how many times I actually threw up), one instance of smell aversion and... that's about it.  I feel really healthy and apparently my body agrees with me, leading my husband to exclaim we should keep me pregnant ALL the time! Haha...
AskWomen X The question I don't really hear answered is: Do you WANT this baby?  You mention your bf would be open to it. That conceiving might be more difficult later on. That you'd prefer to be married first etc.  But all these reasons are actually secondary to you wanting it.  You're not a statistic - you're a person.  And what do you, as a person, want? Do you want to be a mother at 22, or not? Imagine your life, realistically, how it would go with a baby, or how it would go without it.  Are there any dreams/ambition that a child would make difficult? Do you feel ready? Would I child make you happy? Could you and your bf realistically provide for it?  Only you can answer these questions!
TwoXChromosomes X I think all of the mixed hormone methods (pill, patch, ring, etc) are supposed to be pretty effective at reducing acne, although I've heard the ring is not as good (possibly because it has lower levels of hormones). The standard combined oral contraceptive pill is sometimes prescribed solely to reduce acne. 
BabyBumps X I'm breastfeeding twins, and my lactation consultant told me I needed to be pumping after every feeding because there was no way I could make enough milk for two babies without it, but you know what? I stopped pumping when they were like a week old because it sucked. And they're super chubby and healthy without pumping, so I'm pretty sure my supply is just fine. Unless you think you have supply issues or need to have a stash for work/school/etc, I wouldn't worry about it. I only pump now if I need to be away from them for more than 3 hours, which is pretty much never.
BabyBumps X Sounds like a horrible person. As a side note my sister breast fed her babies (well one is still going she lets them wean themselves. Her first stopped around two) and she has the drop ins, vent airs etc etc. Granted she didn't use them as often but her children chose the ones they liked (each one was different). I was all crazy worried about nipple confusion as well but she said since I'm mostly BF from the "tap" that won't really come up.
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely normal. I had some heavy spotting (like an average-light period) right after insertion for probably 5 days. Also, your cycles may not become regular again for a few months, until your body adjusts to the IUD.
TwoXChromosomes X Yup. I took microgestin (generic of loestrin) and told my gyn I wanted to tricycle packs, basically skip two packs of placebos and only have my period every 2 months or so. I did that for about a year, but it did cause spotting occasionally. You'll be just fine skipping one batch of placebos.
BabyBumps X I just wanted to mention that pumping doesn't give your nipples a break. At least I personally found the pump tends to make my nipples sorer and it dries them out.
BabyBumps X If you will be primarily pumping, I'd suggest an electric pump. I use a Medela Pump in Style. It was expensive, but so worth it. (I almost exclusively breastfed for the first four months, with about 3 bottles of expressed milk a week.) Now we go through about 10 oz. of expressed a day because of daycare.  I am lucky- I get about 6-7 oz of milk with pumping for about 10-15 minutes. That is a lot, compared to what my friends get in the same amount of time. I used a manual pump for the first time last week when I was traveling (with the baby, but for a conference) and I barely got 2 oz after about 20 minutes. I cannot imagine primarily pumping and only using a manual pump unless your supply is exceptional. Good luck!
BabyBumps X I used the Hypnobanies CDs as did two friends of mine. One had great luck with it (natural birth), one had better luck with it when she had her second baby. My (second) labor ended up being an insane, one hour unplanned home birth. So to be honest I can't say 100% that the techniques helped me. However, I found the CDs empowering throughout my pregnancy and did find the relaxation techniques useful.  I think anything that can empower and help you relax is great. But I also think its important to have realistic expectations - you might not have a completely calm, silent, smiley birth in a hypnotic trance - and that's ok too!
Parenting X Did your doctor take a urine sample to check for a UTI? It's less common in boys but definitely still something to look for with an otherwise asymptomatic fever. 
BabyBumps X oh yea I haven't been worried about lack of morning sickness, I just started wondering if I took everything for granted. I slept on it and feel much better about it especially waking up to all of these nice comments :)
TwoXChromosomes X Here's the deal: You should never value not weirding out the guy over protecting yourself. If you want him to wear a condom when you go down on him, have sex with him or whatever with him, and he doesn't want to, don't do anything with him. Your health is more important.  I'm not very well-versed in the typical protocol of oral sex. Though they do make flavored ones, just saying.
TwoXChromosomes X It takes a while for your body to get back to normal after stopping the pill, so this doesn't sound too abnormal to me. When I stopped the pill, I didn't have a period for 70 days, then had two in one month... It took me probably 4 months to adjust. If things don't get better in a few more months, then you should probably go to the doctor to make sure nothing else is wrong.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes Yes!  Nurses flat out LIED to me about formula.  I was told that my daughter would starve and be in pain while waiting for my milk to come in if I didn't give her formula.  At one point the baby was crying really really loud and the nurse glared at me like I was a criminal when I tried to put her on the breast.  My milk took ages to come in - likely because she was rarely stimulating milk production at the nipple.  Then I was told that I wasn't making enough milk (actually not making enough milk is rare) so I should supplement with formula.  In reality, I never put her on the nipple enough to stimulate milk production.  My milk was dry by 4 months.  I was told that if I breastfed I would have to watch my diet and take vitamins or my kid would be malnourished.  :(  On the way out of the hospital, I was given 2 large cans of nestle goodstart and a coupon book.  With my second child I had an over abundance of milk and probably could have fed a small army of babies.    I'm just so happy that by child #2 I knew a bit more so I could start that relationship successfully.   
BabyBumps X be grateful you are having contractions!  i'm not even having any of those really.  i had like an hours worth on monday night, if that.  other wise it's just nothing but lack of sleep and constant pain all over my body.  not contraction pains either, like my fingers are super swollen with water retention and my knuckles crack all the time, my inner thighs are so sore there are times when i can't even walk, my back is hurting, my arms... ugh!  baby time needs to happen.  when it does for you i wish you all the best and much luck.  congrats (soon) on your new family member!
BabyBumps X Congrats! :)    I started showing at 10 weeks but this is my 2nd and they say you show faster after the first.    Cute bump! 
BabyBumps X I know how you feel! Was due 2/12 but on 2/1 had contractions 3-5 minutes apart for 3 hours and then...nothing. Then periods of contractions on and off for the next week and half. It got to the point where I could almost count on them starting late in the evening and going away by bedtime. At 39 week appointment I was 1.5 cm dilated and (after a membrane sweep) I was 4 cm at 40 weeks. Was afraid I'd walk around like that having contractions but going nowhere for ANOTHER week...  If it's any encouragement (and/or warning) to you...I started having what I THOUGHT was the same contractions on Saturday night and they turned into real labor faster than I expected! I almost didn't make it to the hospital, lol, but everything turned out fine.  Good luck! I hope it gets real for you soon!
TwoXChromosomes X I have, but was just told I had bad periods and maybe they'd settle down if I put on weight. A friend had endometriosis and my periods def weren't as bad as hers- maybe I'm just a wuss!
TwoXChromosomes X You have a different situation. You did not CHOOSE to have formula. You after painstakingly trying to nurse your child had to switch to formula. I get that. For my daughter, we supplemented because of jaundice (later found out that was misinformation from the doctor and was the easy way out). Then was told by lactation consultants that I was producing just enough for her to survive but not grow. (My milk was either SUPER slow to come in or wasn't enough because of dietary issues) She was supplemented with formula then self weened fully at 6 months.  I cried when I found out that I wasn't "enough of a mom" for her. I get it, really. But I also knew all the information and knew in our situation that she needed some formula. There was no choice, it was formula or malnutrition. 
TwoXChromosomes X My mom had it done a few years back. She had endometriosis and also dealt with a lot of pain. It was a relief for her and everyone in my family for her to not be in pain anymore! plus she loves not having periods at all. The only thing she noticed is the symptoms of menopause. She used something called estrogel and she would just put it on her arms and legs and it worked like a charm. Good luck!
BabyBumps X I'm a bigger girl (190lbs) and still not seeing much at 16 weeks. I feel like I'll be in that 'fat or pregnant' stage for a while. Totallllly can't wait until I look like I'm definitely up the duff!
Parenting X Agree.  The best advice I ever got from a "more experienced parent" was this:  "You know how great your baby is right now?  Every day is better.  Ever day is the best day.  Enjoy it."  My wife and I try to live this, even though it's tough sometimes.  If you focus on the bad things that happen during the day, you'll miss out on all the great things.
BabyBumps X The same thing happened to me a little over a year ago when we first started trying. I wasn't pregnant, but turned out that I have PCOS. However, if that were the case here, it would be unlikely that this is the first time in your life your period did this. (Most women with PCOS ovulate infrequently and therefore menstruate infrequently unless they are on medication.) Likely, your doctor will want to do blood work to see if you're pregnant or if there is anything else hormonally wrong. She may also want to do a transvaginal ultrasound to rule out polycystic ovaries. My doctor eventually put me on metformin, a diabetes medication that is also effective at treating certain kinds of PCOS, and I got pregnant within three months after that (My PCOS was indicated or caused by insulin resistance).  I hope that there is nothing wrong and that you just had a late ovulation and possibly low HCG levels at this point. (Those could cause false negatives.) 
TwoXChromosomes X The woman who was bleeding out shouldn't have been refused care that could have saved her due to his beliefs! The doctor didn't have to perform an abortion, and he didn't. But she could have died because of what he believes. He has a right to his beliefs, but he cant force them on other people. Dying people. Where is the empathy for her? He didn't have to perform an abortion, but he should have made sure she was treated!   All he had to do was step aside and call someone. Or let someone else call someone. 
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks! I haven't had any side effects either. One of my doctors (not the one that prescribed it) was worried about the possible weight gain, but I haven't experienced that yet. 
BabyBumps X WHY are they doing a pap?  She should speak with her doctor about her concerns.  I had a pap in early pregnancy in one of my pregnancies and it was actually quite painful, which I've read is common, and it caused bleeding for a few days afterward.  With my next pregnancy, even though I was due for a pap a few months into the pregnancy, I spoke about my concerns with my doctor and he said it wasn't a big deal and that we could wait until 6 weeks post-partum to do it, since all of my previous paps had come back as normal.  
BabyBumps X Keep using First Response or another pink dye test. Blue tests are notoriously hard to interpret and can look like false positives (or negatives, because the contrast is low).
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure how many of you have seen this, but there are pro-life groups out there with the blown-up posters of aborted fetuses with the word "CHOICE?" underneath. Their implication that a zygote or embryo has the mental capabilities to come to a life or death conclusion is astounding. They don't have a brain yet! It's the same argument they are using for this bill: That the unborn is a life they must protect. Well, they have no idea what kind of life they are protecting. It can't think or feel emotion. That zygote can one day grow up to be the next Hannibal Lecter.
BabyBumps X A fried of mine has been recommending acupuncture - apparently it worked for her. I wish I had the time to try it out!  I was in the hospital yesterday for my induction but based on my progress (or lack thereof) they sent me home with a foley catheter which fell out less than 24 hours later (indicating that I am dilating! yay!). They sent me home because they felt that keeping me in the hospital and continuing with an oxytocin drip would cause me to end up with a c-section. So induction has not been such a bad thing for me so far!
TwoXChromosomes X 1. Since I started using depo-provera, I have experienced anxiety attacks. It IS listed in the possible side effects, but I don not really believe the two to be related. Still- worth mentioning. 2. Absolutely I have had a positive experience. I am very, very happy on depo. I have no period, no spotting, no mood swings, no weight loss/gain, etc... 3. Bone density is a big one on depo. Be sure to ask your doctor about it, especially if you started with a low-calcium diet. They say the anxiety can be triggered by it, so if you're prone to attacks, you may want to keep an eye on that. I would very firmly say however that it was the right method for me, and if it weren't for that bone densisty thing, I would not use any other method for myself.
BabyBumps X I'm lucky, mine didn't show up until almost 2 weeks ago. I was just at 38 weeks (I'll be 40 weeks on Saturday!!!!) I can't imagine going through half my pregnancy with this... I wish you the best of luck!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Here is the thing though, it is literally impossible for me to have developed an STI. I have only had one sexual partner in my life, we always used condoms, and lost our virginity to one another. There is no way he could have had an STI. Furthermore, I haven't had any sexual contact of any sort of five months. Yet, I am now showing signs of STI's.  I HOPE you do not have an STI however you cannot entirely prevent herpes transmission by using a condom, but you can reduce it. Herpes spreads by skin-to-skin contact instead of through bodily fluids. Since condoms don't cover all potentially infectious skin, they can not completely stop herpes spread. STI's can take months to show up especially in women where it is more latent. In fact a lot of women don't know they have an STI which can cause PID. If you are sexually active it is imperative you get a check at least once a year for your health. People can have herpes for years without breakouts, so if you have not had regular tests it will be almost impossible to determine exactly when you contracted it.  &gt;I have only had one sexual partner in my life, we always used condoms, and lost our virginity to one another. There is no way he could have had an STI.   I am sorry to say that if you have an STI you got it from him. I had a friend who actually got HPV from her first. He said he was a virgin and refused to admit he gave it to her. He said she must have gotten it elsewhere. She had a grade below cervical cancer and had to get a cone done. Apparently his exgf also had the same thing happen to her years later.  Toilet seats and whatever other myths you have heard that can spread an STI can't. Only sexual activity can. Maybe he didn't have penetrative sex but he got  herpes from a sexual act if you in fact have herpes. 
TwoXChromosomes X This may not be good medical advice (I feel the need to say option 1 should ALWAYS be to go see a doctor) but I've had 3 UTIs in my life and the all went away after drinking TONS of water and cranberry juice.  I've heard tons of people say that it's not a cure, but it worked for me.  Try to get unsweetened cranberry juice and drink water constantly to flush out the infection. If the symptoms get more serious or if you see blood in your urine, you absolutely need to go to the doctor/ER.
TwoXChromosomes X I had the same experience with my IUD. I've had it for almost a year and my periods normalled out, and are even lighter now.   I understand your rage, but it won't be as bad when you go 6 weeks without a period.   And on the plus side, no babies for 5 years!!!!
TwoXChromosomes X Don't apologize for bringing it up- it is not uncommon to deal with signs and symptoms- in fact only 50% of people over the course of their lifetime do *not* contract the most common STD as signs are more often than not latent in men. [True story]( -hpv.htm) 
BabyBumps X  I asked for my arms not to be strapped to the table, for the procedure to be explained to me as it happened, no narcotics (which they discussed with me and I finally agreed to a low dose), and to hold/breastfeed my baby as soon as possible after he was delivered (didn't happen, he was floppy and unresponsive).   I'm glad my arms weren't strapped, and the anesthesiologist explained everything to me very clearly. The staff also did their best to discuss all my options with me and my husband (instead of just giving a suggestion for what we should do), which was also in our birth plan. 
BabyBumps X I didn't hear the heartbeat at first, and I didn't have my first ultrasound until 9 weeks - at which time we found out we were actually 6.5 weeks, so that was to be expected. Everything was fine. Don't worry until after the ultrasound - part of the reason for it is to _date_ the pregnancy. You may be perfectly healthy but not as far along as you think, and so that could be a factor. 
TwoXChromosomes X I also started on birth control because of my period...I wasn't even sexually active until at least 4 years later. I had my period for 6 weeks. Normal? I think not...
BabyBumps X Because I suffer from abnormal hormone levels and it was recommended that I get re-tested. My body isn't normal.
BabyBumps X not sure if this will help you, but I am going to share anyway, because not enough people know about chiropractics during pregnancy! I started having unbearable hip pain very early in pregnancy (like 11-12 weeks) and I asked my OBGYN about it and he was like "oh, that's normal" and it just didn't feel normal! I was never diagnosed with SPD or anything, but I could barely walk, and when I did it was with a limp, sitting was torture, turning over in bed didn't happen without tears, I collapsed on the floor a few times trying to get up in the morning, and getting into and out of my car was im-fucking-possible. it felt like my legs were being ripped off and my coochie was imploding. opening my legs was also on the can't-do list (my poor husband, when the morning sickness left, the hip pain began!). after trying a heating pad and tylenol for two weeks, I gave up and went to a chiropractor that my friend recommended when she was pregnant. IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I've only been going for a few weeks now, and the difference is truly amazing. sometimes the adjustments are a little bit painful, and she does spend a lot of time working on my hips and lower back (she even works on my pubic bone, that is the most painful one of course!) but when we're done I feel like a million bucks. my hip pain is nearly nonexistant now. I intend to go to her through the rest of my pregnancy because it's that awesome.  I really hope you find relief soon, be in from a belt or a chiropractor or something. good luck!!
BabyBumps X I was born via c-section after my mom as in labor with me for over 24 hours. I just didn't want to come out!
BabyBumps X 24 hours is not a long time to be in labor. It took 3 days for my sister to arrive in this world (vaginally, naturally). My home birth midwife had a client go over a week after her water broke. If baby and mom are fine, there is no need for a c-section just because of labor length. 
BabyBumps X I had similar bleeding off and on during the first trimester into the second.  It was a result of a sub-chorionic hematoma (SCH) ... basically a little blip that just loves to bleed and freak me out.  They were able to see it with a sonogram and measure it.  With some "taking it easy" and a TON of water, it got better.  It reared up now and then after I pushed myself too hard, but eventually it bled itself out...  Not all bleeding is bad, but did they not see the source on the sonogram?  Can you find a specialist perhaps?
TwoXChromosomes X Just to make sure you understand how to do this-  You don't do that for the period before Bonnaroo.  You skip the placebo/iron pills that you would normally have been taking during Bonnaroo and you'll skip that period.  Start your next pack immediately instead.  Keep in mind that if you're going to do this more than twice a year, you might need additional packs added to your annual prescription so that your insurance doesn't try to stop covering it after 12 packs per year.   Have a wonderful time!  :)
TwoXChromosomes X The first few times I used mine, I was frustrated that I couldn't get it quite right. The [FAQ]( ) section on their website was *really* helpful.  Here are some things I'd recommend:   * Try the "push down" fold. It's much easier than the C fold in my opinion. * When inserting it, get it to the point where the rim is inside you, and then squeeze around the base until it unfolds. Then you twist it in a circle while it's still only halfway inside of you (so that you can actually get a grip on the base) to seal it properly. *Then* push it the rest of the way in.  * If it's inserted properly, you should be able to feel the suction just a little bit if you tug on the base. * If you're having trouble getting it out, sit down on the toilet and bear down on it. You should be able to grab the base, tug on it, then reach up and pinch it closer to the rim to break the seal and remove it easily.   
BabyBumps X It is of the mother's pelvis won't open to accommodate the baby and they get stuck in the birth canal. After 24 hrs of natural laboring on pitocin without an epi, my bug was stuck so I had a c-section. I'm okay with it. Not all women are meant to deliver vaginally. Historically they or their babies didn't make it.   I'm happy, genuinely, for all women regardless of their labors. So for those who have vaginal births, you rock! C-sections, you rock too!  Both are different but equally valid, tough labors and births. 
TwoXChromosomes X Tampons clog drains and mess up plumbing really easily as they expand a whole lot and aren't designed to break down the way toilet paper is. I don't know if you've ever talked to a plumber before, but tampons being flushed down toilets is one of the most common reasons for toilets to get clogged, and requires the pipes to be snaked to be fixed. It's a lot more problems than really should be put on anyone's shoulders when you can simply throw them away.   Even the ones labeled "flushable" on their packaging carry the risk of getting caught up in pipes, old or new. 
BabyBumps X True, there are cases, my mother-in-law was a huge hippy and attempted the home birth, but had complications and ended up with a c-section for all 3.  In my opinion with people we know directly, doctors are quick to suggest surgery, because it's faster and they are more 'in control' while they consider long labors a danger.  Many doctors haven't even seen complete natural births before.  My sister was scared into 1 because the doctor told her the baby was breached 2 weeks before due date and the location of the cord was 'questionable'.  I thought it was bs and told her a baby can move at any time and unbreach, but she went with it anyway.  She regretted it and is going all natural next time.  We also have close friend that are afraid of having babies that are 'too big', which is ridiculous in my opinion, so they scheduled inductions with the doctor.  I'm not sure why a doctor would give them the go ahead and not explain to them that it's rare to have a problem due to size alone, but eh, what you gonna do.
BabyBumps X When this pregnancy, I tested two days after I thought I was due for my period.  Negative.  Then I tested almost a week later and it was positive.  Twice.  So just wait a bit and test again.
TwoXChromosomes X You're just going to have to try it and see. Some women experienced a decreased libido, others don't. Side effects will vary depending on the woman and on the form of birth control. There are SO many different kinds of hormonal birth control (the Pill, the patch, Nuva-Ring, Implanon, and Mirena) that the odds are high that she'll be able to find something that works for her.  Your GF might want to ask her doctor about low-hormone forms of the Pill- certain brands have lower amounts of estrogen than others. If she can afford it, she might also want to look into the NuvaRing: it releases a low dose of estrogen/progesterone pretty much constantly, so women who use it often experience fewer side effects than they would if they were on the Pill. 
TwoXChromosomes X so glad to hear that your libido is coming back. it took me about 6 months to get back to pre-pill hormone levels. I've been off the pill for ~3 years and I feel like "me" again. it's wonderful.
BabyBumps X I haven't gained ANY weight.  Like a half pound here and there.  I gained a normal amount since becoming pregnant too.  I'm just one giant baby bump that has all baby in my bump.  You can't even tell I'm pregnant from the back.
TwoXChromosomes X They definitely dinged my libido. The only thing I found that worked was switching to a non-hormonal IUD. Those I highly recommend because a) no hormones and b) don't have to remember to take pills!
TwoXChromosomes X It's pretty normal for one breast to be larger than the other one (especially the left side), but if the change is NEW then you may want to go see your doctor.   For breast exams: Check your breasts on the fourth day after your period *starts*. If you feel something on one side then that isn't on the other DON'T PANIC. Wait a couple of days and check again. If you still feel a lump that doesn't feel like the rest of your breast tissue see your doctor. No worries. Lumps can be lots of different things that aren't necessarily worrisome, but it's always good to get things checked out just in case. 
BabyBumps X I had terrible, excruciating hip/butt/hip joint pain starting at 11-12 weeks. it was just insane. no position, sitting/standing/lying down would alleviate it, and any kind of movement was agony. my OBGYN said it was normal (YEAH EFFING RIGHT) but I couldn't fathom the thought of living with that pain for the next 6 months. so I started seeing a chiropractor. IT WAS LIFE CHANGING. I cannot recommend this enough. my pain is nearly nonexistant now. pregnancy pillows and stretches did very little to ease my pain, but my chiropractor is a miracle worker. I really hope you find relief soon!
BabyBumps X Good luck!    If they want to induce, simply decline until after 41wks (as long as everything is ok).  My OB had no issues waiting until 40 + 5 to discuss induction options.  Stay strong, and FWIW, (in my single experience) the epidural was *nothing* compared to the contractions.  Good luck in whatever you decide, I'll keep an eye out for your birth story!!
TwoXChromosomes X No, contraceptives are wonderful and should be praised.  An abortion is a sign that someone had poorly planned sex, unwanted sex, or had a contraceptive fail.  I want to live in a world where nobody has to get an abortion because they were smart about sex and used contraceptives to prevent unplanned pregnancies.  But in the world we live in, abortions are still a necessary measure that should be accessible to women.  
BabyBumps X Your body is busy establishing a milk supply in the early months. Are you planning to exclusively pump or feed him at the breast? Are you pumping every time he eats so that your body knows how much milk to make? It sounds like your body could be confused.  I don't have a whole lot of experience with pumping- to regulate things I personally would feed my baby from the breast, as he shows signs of being hungry. How often are you feeding/ pumping/ emptying your breasts? I'd assume at least  every 3-4 hours.  If your breasts are really sore in between feedings, you can pump a little to relieve the pain. If you empty them, though, that tells your body to make more milk, so I'd avoid that. I'm confused as to why you're mostly using formula if you're making more than enough milk to feed him breast milk. Give him the good stuff! The pain does get better, the first weeks are the worst. Around  the one month mark things seemed to get easier/ not as painful for me.  Hang in there! The worst is almost over! And, r/breastfeeding might be a good resource for you. Good luck!. 
Parenting X I'm going to say yes. PPD can make you feel like a bad mother, which can lead to over-compensating. The more you feel like a failure, the more you will try and do everything that is still within your control to make up for it. But if it is getting to the point of tears, then I would agree that PPD could have something to do with it.   It may be hard to convince her to do something which might hurt her breastfeeding chances (yet another way to feel like a failure) - but a happy healthy mom will lead to a happy healthy baby. If she is having this much anxiety (which is what it sounds like, because it doesn't sound like the fears are really rational) then it may be something to approach with her.  Also, those hormones really do cause your mind to do some crazy things. You say she has 2 weeks left - how many weeks did she have off? If she only took 6 weeks off (so baby is only 4 weeks old) than I would say to wait it out, and see if it gets better. If she took 12 weeks off, and baby is 10 weeks old, it may be time to see if there are some other ways to address this. 
TwoXChromosomes X It'd be up to my partner. Personally, even if he took something I wouldn't stop taking my pill(in spite of the side effects), I don't think any other method would ease my anxiety about getting pregnant enough. I prefer to be more in control I guess. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is the same for me. Off the pill I get terrible cramps, 2 week long periods, become an emotionally unstable lump who can't do anything without crying and pretty much on the verge of self harm. On the pill I'm totally normal, no pain, regular periods and no acne. I've not had any side effects like lack of sex drive or anything.   
BabyBumps X Same here! My best friend has PCOS and has been trying for a long time. She's Married, stable, and is super wonderful. She has been supportive my whole pregnancy. It seems the good ones always have problems with conceiving. I know I would be a great Mom but honestly I wish she could have gotten pregnant before me. 
TwoXChromosomes X They've been fine. Slightly heavier than with the pill, but I use Diva cup and I still have to empty it just twice a day. Sometimes I take some pain meds the first couple of days, but I often had to do that also with the pill. My periods have always been quite easy, so it might be worse for others.   My mother had copper IUDs for about 20 years without any problems. That's probably why I had the courage to have one.
BabyBumps X Ah! Heading there today then! I picked up a bunch of old navy maternity stuff last month and I love it all! I want to go back and get a couple more pairs of their leggings. They are amazing and they STAY where I put them unlike the thyme maternity ones I bought that just stretched out all over the place!  
TwoXChromosomes X No, you're not fools, but consider the implications carefully looking at all the choices. I wouldn't rule out keeping it but not getting married, just as I wouldn't rule out getting an abortion. Good luck with the decision making process, and I hope your relationship goes well whatever your choice is!
BabyBumps X It's very hard to fight that urge to push.  Luckily, I only had to last a couple of contractions with my first before I could push, just had to wait for the doctor.  With my second, it wasn't really the same, there was no urge to push, there was...ohmyfuckinggod,i'mpushingandican'tstopevenifmylifedependedonit!  It was a very strange experience to go through, lol
TwoXChromosomes X Republicans want loads of poorly educated and impoverished workers/soldiers. That's why they want to limit women's access to birth control.  
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you so much! I first had abdominal pain (after being released from the hospital) and as my belly grew smaller (from less swelling) pain from my abdominal areas have subsided where as I was getting the same nerve pain in my shoulder, especially when I lean towards the right and when I lie down which is weird because I got that. Now the back of my rib cage hurts (My lungs I think?) Otherwise everything is okay :) &lt;3 thanks for sharing your experiences again! :) 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't have to empty mine more than once a day... I think it would need emptying much less often than you would need to change a tampon, so you might be surprised. But they don't work for everyone. 
TwoXChromosomes X Do you have a regular doctor? Ask your doctor if they can do your exam! My exams have been done by my family doctor, the same lady who helped my mother deliver me 24 years ago. It's awkward, but it's *way* less awkward working with her (who saw me on day 1) than some random stranger. Try to go to someone you have a reason to trust.  If you don't have a regular doctor, get a recommendation from your mom, or other friendly family member, or a best friend. Good luck! It's not too bad! :)
TwoXChromosomes X Perhaps. One day artificial wombs will be a thing. At that point abortion SHOULD be banned...assuming the fetus can be transferred during what would otherwise be an abortion. Abortion would be replaced with fetus/zygote transplants. If/when that day arrives abortion won't be necessary, nor desired IMO, since the fetus can be safely extracted per the woman's wishes...that's what being pro-choice is all about--her body. Once that's achieved, now it's about the would-be baby's best interests, which should be to place it in an artificial womb in order to mature and have a life. 
TwoXChromosomes X You could go without and use withdrawal. It's [nearly as effective]( _contr_use.html) as condoms (2% perfect use condoms, 4% withdrawal, 17% real world fail rate condoms, 18% withdrawal).
TwoXChromosomes X This.  My doc told me not to even bother with yogurt - compared to acidophillus supplements, they've got a negligible amount of the good bacteria your body needs.  Since I started taking acidophillus, I haven't had any problems with my lady bits - previously I used to get almost monthly infections.
BabyBumps X This is your first child?  It can take quite a bit longer to feel anything if it's your first.  I can't remember when I started feeling kicks, but I know it was alot sooner with my second.  With my third, I'm already feeling flutters now and then.
BabyBumps X I've been measuring ahead my whole pregnancy. 18 weeks he was measuring 20 according the the ultrasound, and my stomach has been measuring 2 weeks ahead pretty much the whole time. I'll be 38 weeks tomorrow and haven't dilated at all yet. My little dude was measuring 5lb 5oz at my 33 week ultrasound. My doctor said the ultrasound estimates are notoriously wrong and if the baby has a bigger or rounder head (which he does) it can throw off the entire thing. They were estimating he'll be around 8lbs and something at 40 weeks... my boyfriend was a huge baby (almost 11 lbs) so I'm hoping he's not that big!!! No worries! 
TwoXChromosomes X Use probiotics locally (in the form of vaginal suppositories) - getting them through your GI tract won't help much for your vagina, since it's not connected to your GI tract.
BabyBumps X Normal, especially if it's your first time! And if you have an anterior placenta it might take you a little longer to feel him move too. I was 23 weeks or so before I felt my first baby move for sure. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I think it's unlikely you're pregnant but I would definitely take the test anyway to be sure. The date of your next period really means about two weeks after ovulation (and possible conception). Sperm can live inside you for a few days but since it's been over three weeks since you had unprotected sex; if you did conceive as a result of it, a pregnancy test should be fairly accurate by now. Take a test now if it's negative you're probably fine, take another in a week to be extra sure.   The symptoms you describe are fairly generic and probably a result of the hit of hormones you gave yourself. Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you ever been on hormones? For the majority of women, they only give beneficial side effects. I don't think any doctor is going to give you a Paragard when you've never even tried the pill or any other sort of hormones because you can't assume that you're going to have a bad experience. Most likely you will have a good experience.  I have a Paragard and I had it inserted in October. I was on the pill for 2 years before that, and had no bad side effects until near the end of that time where I started to get anxiety. I'm starting to think now that the anxiety was developing on its own anyway, and I actually wish I had tried the Mirena before getting the Paragard.  I have always had heavier than average periods and more cramps than average. When I was on the pill, my period was very light, lasted 4-5 days instead of 7-9, and never had cramps. My acne cleared up and I went up a cup size without gaining weight anywhere else. No loss of sex drive, I was overall very happy most of the time. On the Paragard, my periods are *not* fun, and the cramps are getting hard to manage. ([See my post here]( _to_ladies_with_an_iud_about_painkillers/)). It's also extremely heavy, to the point where I can fill up a divacup to the brim (~20 mL) in 3 hours on the worst days.  The insertion was not that bad for me but that varies. I highly recommend trying hormones before swearing them off entirely.
TwoXChromosomes X I'd suggest searching this subreddit as questions about IUDs come up quite often.  My experience was that the insertion was uncomfortable (I've not had kids), but not that bad at all (took 600 mg of ibuprofen before).  I think that expulsion is pretty uncommon.  My periods are longer than they used to be, but not bad.  It's been an amazing form of birth control, I really love it.  Talk to your doctor/nurse, it's a really great option!  Also take opinions on it from the internet with a grain of salt.
TwoXChromosomes X It should be noted that horrible cramps is a downside to Paragard (the copper IUD), but not necessarily Mirena (the hormonal IUD). 
BabyBumps X In california, a reason to do the first trimester prenatal screen is that they will pay for the amnio or quad screen if you screen positive. If you are older, there's no reason to believe the screen positive rate, or rather you have to get really great results to overcome the age risk. If you are concerned about defects, get an amnio, for the certainty.  FWIW, while women over 35 have a higher percentage of children with defects, more children with defects are born to women under 35, because they have so many more children.  40% false positive is indeed ridiculous.
BabyBumps X I had a 1:53 result from my tests, had the amnio, and baby girl is fine. My boyfriend and I had decided we would get a more invasive test if the result was poorer than 1:200.  I think you have pretty good odds there, too, and if you would not terminate based on the results, then don't have the amnio. What a level 2 ultrasound can do is the whole anatomy scan. If there is a problem, they can see if the heart and kidneys are forming well or not, and that can help them later on in determining care, like emergency surgery. (It won't of course, be able to say whether the child has DS or not... half of DS kids have normal US).  But that is a long odd that you'd need to worry about it. So if I were in your shoes, I'd be no on the amnio and yes on the ultrasound. But I am just a random person on the internet :)
TwoXChromosomes X How tall are you? If you've gained 20 lbs., you are lucky enough to look about the same. I'm 5' and 135 lbs. and it is very visible when I gain even a few pounds. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think the vast majority of the anti-C-section movement is much more about unnecessary C-sections than all C-sections.  I think most will admit they are sometimes (many times?) necessary, but that often doctors pressure women into them to make it more convenient for themselves and not for the health of the mother or baby.  There's many cases where a C-section is absolutely vital but there's also many things to take into consideration when deciding to schedule one for no medical reason.
TwoXChromosomes X The main issue is the fact that epidurals can lead to slowed labor, which requires pitosin, which can lead to more pain so a higher epidural, to more pitosin and spiral until the baby is in distress and you need a C-section.  Cesareans stress the baby, don't trigger the release of oxytocin which is the hormone that promotes bonding and is also thought to help with breast feeding.    Epidurals also require (or at least encourage) the on-your-back position for labor, which isn't the ideal position and can slow down the whole pushing process as well when compared to squatting/ walking ect.    So it isn't that pain is good, it's just that we aren't quite at the point where removal of pain has no consequences.  
TwoXChromosomes X I don't like oral sex. Giving or receiving. I think vaginas are a little weird and scary, so I don't like to have one near my face. Having my penis in another person's mouth isn't particularly awesome either.
BabyBumps X I was the same with both of my girls, just totally convinced they will be boys.  This time, it's a surprise. I'm pretty sure it's a girl, but I STILL find myself slipping and saying "he" or accidentally going into the full boy name instead of just "Ro" (both names start with Ro, so we are calling baby Ro until the birth)
TwoXChromosomes X I'll probably get an epidural in July. I watched the Business of being born and felt it was one sided. I think it should be up to the mother to decide what is best for her body.
TwoXChromosomes X Having actually given birth, here's my thoughts.  I was induced due to high BP, and I had a weird reaction to the medication they gave me to induce labor, and so my labor went from nothing (1cm dialated) to crowning in 2  hours without any of the doctors or nurses noticing.  Because of that, I wasn't able to get the epidural that I had planned on, so I had to push that watermelon out the all natural way.  I can honestly say that having done it once, if I could go back and get an epidural instead, I would.  I think that wanting to give birth naturally is a perfectly valid choice, but so is wanting drugs to ease the pain.  People seem to think that just because they made a specific choice, means that everyone else should have to do it the way they did.  It pisses me off.
TwoXChromosomes X I hope you can get through this with your whole family stronger than ever.  Yes it will be painful to lose your child (one way or another), but you have each other, and you have your 3-year-old and you will come through this together.  I'm so sorry you and your family are being faced with this choice.   If it were my decision, I would probably find termination as the more humane option, but I know that you will make peace with whatever decision you come to. 
BabyBumps X I did all the old wives' tales! They are a lot of fun. My intuition said boy on this one, and just because the pregnancy was 100% different I thought boy. All the games (especially the ring/string test) said boy except for one. 
BabyBumps X I understand that losing the mucus plug isn't really a sign of impending labor, bit I guess it would somehow make me feel like I was getting a little closer, silly I know. Thanks for the support ladies (and gents)...it just gets frustrating near the end when I keep hearing about all of these other people who start feeling there bodies ramping up at this time. I have no dilation and my cervix is apparently so far back that my midwife had a hard time checking me at all.   I keep having dreams about my water breaking only to wake up disappointed. I know that it has to happen soon, I just wish soon was REALLY soon :-)
TwoXChromosomes X In addition to your second point, people need to be aware that STIs can be transmitted orally as well. Even if the guy gloves up for genital sex, going down on guys and gals without a condom or a dental dam can still result in STIs being transmitted - herpes, for instance.   Much love to you and your awesome message.   *ETA - not sure why the downvotes, since that's exactly how I got HSV type 1. My guy previously had cold sores as a child, he went down on me, now I have (as PeanutNore put it) clap o' the yap. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not a mother yet, and although I am pro-life, I think in this situation you are making a good decision. I wish you and your wife the best in this hard time. 
TwoXChromosomes X but isn't it a higher risk of getting it if the person has visible warts?   you can actually still pass herpes on even if you're not having an outbreak. sometimes it's active without showing it. i would still say it's smarter to avoid sexual contact when it's a visible outbreak. 
TwoXChromosomes X Something called strepTococcal A infection. It caused multiple organ failure and her limbs had to be amputated. Not paralyzed. My mistake. It could had been caught early if she was in the care of the hospital. I know this won't happen to everyone, but it sure scared me into not risking it at home. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was a strong advocate for natural birth before I had children, too!  Seriously. I went through 35 hours of hard labor and did not progress from 5cm in that whole 35 hours. My contractions were intense and one right on top of the other. My body couldn't relax long enough for me to dilate.  One hour, exactly, after getting my epidural, I was ready to push. And 12 minutes after starting to push, my daughter was delivered. Had I not gotten the epidural, who knows how much longer I would have been in labor or what kind of complications my daughter, or I, would have faced had I continued laboring that hard without progression.  Having a baby is tough - the last thing a woman needs is someone telling her she's delivering her baby *wrong*.
BabyBumps X I haven't had any morning sickness either! It's been a relatively easy pregnancy so far *knocks on wood*
TwoXChromosomes X How's the realisation that most STDs are asymptomatic?  Have you ever had sex with anyone?  Have you been getting your STD test every three months?  Wait, it's reddit, the answer is no to at least one of those questions.  And before you American morons jump down my throat, in many countries it's easy and free to get a full STD panel, including HPV and herpes.
BabyBumps X You may not like what I have to say, but I have to say it. I think you'll find that once you have your baby, you will be so busy putting all of your time and energy into taking care of the new baby that dating really won't work for awhile. You may not have the time and energy to put into a new relationship and a new baby. I really think you should consider waiting to seriously date until things settle down after your baby is born. It might take months, or closer to a year, but once you get a routine established, dating will be easier to fit into your life. You'll also be able to say you have a child before you go on a date, rather than telling someone later. It's much better to be upfront with someone than not. I hope things go well for you. I really do. Good luck with everything, and I'm proud of you for leaving an abusive relationship.
TwoXChromosomes X And the attribution of "fault" (not to mention the association of STIs with sleeping with a different person every week) is a big part of the reason people don't seek testing and treatment- a large contributor to the spread of curable STIs.   HPV on the other hand, a non-curable STI, is not reliably prevented by the use of condoms.
BabyBumps X I "saw" on the ultrasound... But I know what I saw could still be either gender as it was a very fast glance between seeing feet and getting to the belly. The tech was very helpful not to show that area in detail when we said we didn't want to know. Then she kept calling baby "he" lol... But I am comfortable thinking it's just as likely a girl, as she said he long before the wand hit my tummy as well (she always corrected it with "i mean, he or she" but he seemed to be her go-to for talking about babies.
BabyBumps X As everyone has been saying, it's completely normal.  First thing I asked my doctor at my first appointment (6 weeks) was when cramping should be expected, and when to be worried. As you're uterus and ligaments are stretching, you usually will feel some discomfort and cramping. Starting week 13 you may develop round ligament pain, a stretching across your lower abdomen. Some women will have a little bit of cramping, and some very limited spotting from sex, if the cervix is irritated.   This should not concern you unless it's more than light spotting, or lasts more than 24 hours. You can also get some cramping after achieving orgasm.  This usually does not last longer than 15 to 30 minutes. (Usually only lasts 5 minutes for me) If the cramping lasts longer than an hour, be careful.  Orgasms can possibly trigger labor, but usually that's not a concern until later on in the pregnancy.
BabyBumps X I never realized how much pressure there is for women to get meds during birth, it's disturbing. It's such a natural event and it seems like the first world has tried to make it as pretty and convenient an event as possible. Of course things happen, but how routine it all is is disturbing.   A friend of a friend gave birth today. She was given pitocin, her water broke by the doctor, and an epidural, and she wasn't even overdue. Her due date was three days from now, and there was no medical reason. Seems crazy!
TwoXChromosomes X No, they don't. Why should they? They are not a person. A person *in potentia*, yes, but so is sperm. A woman is a person. Why should a *person in potentia* be put above a fully developed human being and its wellbeing? Especially if they will lose their privilege after birth?  I really don't get republican americans in this aspect. They're all "don't kill the babies!!!" but they want no healthcare, no public education for adult humans. And they want half of humans to see the reproduction process as sinful. And they talk about freedom. Sorry, what? This is such intense rubbish, I don't even...!  At times like this I'm so glad I live in a democracy where my live is valued no matter what.
TwoXChromosomes X I used to have fainting spells when I was younger. I was slightly anemic at the time. You can get tested at the Drs/nurse in seconds and it's pretty easy to solve.
Parenting X &gt;I did not see any indication that these "planned homebirths" were attended by a certified professional midwife, a licensed midwife, a "lay midwife", or no one at all.   Well, it's, you know, *the law*. They'd have a heck of a time finding that many home births that were attended by Dad and Mrs. Carrington, the nice lady next door.
BabyBumps X I did at 10 weeks after our ultrasound. I have had 2 miscarriages, including one where I found out via my first ultrasound. I would have waited longer, but I was having issues enjoying my pregnancy and not wanting to do anything to "jinx" it and it was making me miserable. So I started taking belly shots (no, not for facebook!) and we told our families and announced on facebook after the ultrasound as a way to try and finally be excited about the baby instead of just scared all the time.   Edit: that pregnancy turned out just fine and we have a 6 month old daughter now :)
BabyBumps X I was tracking my ovulation because we were trying to get pregnant, so I know for a fact that my daughter was conceived 5 days after the last time we had sex that cycle. (I ovulated later than expected that cycle and we ran out of steam...)
TwoXChromosomes X No, not all at the same time! One after another. You might consider a different brand of BC with different synthetic hormones before taking opiates. Also talk to your doc about Mirena, because it often stops your period completely.   There are other options than opioids, maybe better options. Keep looking!
TwoXChromosomes X they are ensuring that sex outside of marriage will be devastation due to STIs and unplanned pregnancy. They **want** people who have sex outside of marriage to be punished but don't have the guts to try to enforce state laws against cohabitation so they say "think of the children!" and instead try to keep them in ignorance as if that will stop them from having sex because before sex education there were no out of wedlock births at all right.
BabyBumps X My tech told me 15 weeks is the minimum but the longer you wait the more accurate it is. In our case there was no mistaking it though! She did a 4D(3D??) view to double check!- [pic]( )
BabyBumps X Very cool!  I have an appt at 14 weeks, and presumably another at 18, and I thought that might be too early to find out.  Guess not!
BabyBumps X wow, that is messed up! I don't have any advice for you or anything, but I also don't understand how that happens and companies get away with it. total BS. I work at a university and we don't get any sort of paid leave, but we can take 12 weeks of what's called "FMLA" leave and use our own vacation and sick time if we want to get paid during that time. it also sucks, but what can you do? 
TwoXChromosomes X So... since 80%-85% of people have HSV-1 (cold sores, even if they never get breakouts)... that means no one should ever have unprotected oral sex just in case?  I'm really freaked out right now.
TwoXChromosomes X i just want to ask (in no way to be snarky), if the fetus was going to be born with severe deformities such as Anencephaly or if the mother will die if she doesn't abort the fetus, would you still be against abortion? also, what about rape victims (i.e. a young girl raped by her father)?
BabyBumps X Congrats on bringing baby home! I have been practicing hypnobabies and am wondering if it really is pain free. I know it's different for everyone but how was it with your wife?
TwoXChromosomes X Use extra toilet paper then. Bonus trick: When you take out the old tampon and unwrap the new tampon, you can use the wrapper from the new tampon to wrap the old one.
TwoXChromosomes X Interesting, but almost every country has a limit on when an elective abortion can be carried out. Would you in principle support abortion at 8 months (not for medical reasons). This is a somewhat hypothetical question because I think it would be very rare that a woman would want this.
TwoXChromosomes X These things do happen. I get the occasional odd period and I've been on the pill for nearly 5 years. I wouldn't worry too much but there's never any harm in going to see a doctor just to put your mind at ease. 
TwoXChromosomes X I suppose I was being very general. I do support the rules in place preventing elective late term abortions; the laws give women enough time to decide.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on Yaz for a year before my mother began seeing commercials about lawsuits for bloodclots and things on cable. I quit taking it even though I had a really good experience with it.  When I got my own health insurance I inquired to my OBGYN about those commercials and he told me that all hormonal birth control pills are prettymuch equal risk of those kinds of side effects, and that Yaz was just being targeted by other companies. I would be at the same risk on any other type of hormonal birth control.   My experience with the pill is significantly less menstrual pain, one cup size larger bra, and much clearer skin (the main reason for me to be taking the pill), but my libido is down quite a bit. That's unfortunate, but I make efforts to keep my sex life lively. 
TwoXChromosomes X I guess by "person" I mean has the attributes that we value in humanity. We can fuse sperm and eggs in a lab, this is something that has the genetic composition of a human and given the right environment will develop into a human. However this clearly (to me anyway) doesn't have the same value as a fully formed baby. If you could pause the ageing process a baby would still be a life worth preserving in my eyes, however if a zygote was only ever going to be a zygote it wouldn't be worth keeping it going. i.e. the zygote is something that has potential to become valuable life but isn't yet.  I'm also inclined to agree about the "my body my choice" line of thinking. We have to accept that if you binge drink while pregnant it isn't just your body you're harming. You're basically causing someone else brain damage. 
TwoXChromosomes X But the pro-life camp in Ireland also believes women only have abortions out of 'convenience' and seem to have no idea of the real, hurtful and heartbreaking consequences of our very strict ant-abortion laws. 
TwoXChromosomes X Your knowledge of seeds is lacking. Look into endosperm, this necessary tissue of the seeds occurs around the time of fertilization. Without fertilization a plant will not grow from that seed. The womb, once fertilization has occured does contain the genetic material of the foetus and from it a baby will grow. Secondly, you don't attach rights to humans, the opposition seeks to. 'Person' is arguably more subjective than what a "human" is. You've made no argument for your case, you've just presented what the current debate is about. However, if and when personhood is granted at conception, this entire debate would be useless, right?
TwoXChromosomes X hey, I got one installed about 2 months ago. I've never been pregnant. For me, the insertion itself wasn't painful, just uncomfortable. Immediately afterwards I had spotting and cramps. I had bad cramps for like a week, and my next period was longer. I definitely bleed more now. I also get random pains sometimes and I can sort of feel the iud in there. I think this is because I've never been pregnant so my uterus hasn't been stretched out at all. The pain isn't anything I can't deal with though. For me it's worth it because I don't have to worry about taking birth control or getting pregnant. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X From Tampax's website, on their [Tampax Flushable Cardboard]( -US/products/productDetail.aspx?ID=tampax-flushable) FAQ page:  &gt;Can I flush the entire thing? Yes. The Tampax Cardboard tampon, wrapper AND applicator can be flushed in toilets connected to city sewer systems. Frequent flushing of tampons is not recommended for septic systems.
BabyBumps X We actively tried for one cycle. I was convinced it would take a while due to my endometriosis and almost 10 years of no accidents (I was on bc for most of that time, but we weren't always careful) but I was wrong.
TwoXChromosomes X I think you should approach it from the angle that your son deserves to decide for himself whether or not to be circumcised. If you circumcise him as a baby, he will never have the option of being intact, but if you leave his penis the way it was when he was born, he can be circumcised in the future if that's what he wants.  I don't think circumcision is wrong for silly political reasons, I think it's wrong because it's an medically unnecessary procedure that has the possibility of being botched and damaging the penis much more severely than was intended. It also reduces sexual function, making the penis head less sensitive due to constant direct rubbing from clothing and not allowing it to stay moist. The purpose of the foreskin is to protect the penis, and if you remove this protection, the head of the penis is damaged by overexposure to friction and dryness. Not to mention, the frenulum, which connects the penis to the foreskin, is one of the most sensitive parts of the penis, and it is severed in circumcision.   Boys are born with foreskins. They should be allowed to keep them. Only 30% of baby boys are still circumcised in the USA today, and that rate is lower in other Western countries, so if your husband is worrying about your son being the odd one out in the changing rooms, he will be more odd if he's circumcised. 
TwoXChromosomes X As a male who has been cut, please do not let that happen to him. 'll really never know what it would have been like, but I wish I had a choice.   The nerve ending density in the foreskin is similar to that of the nerve ending density in the head of a woman's, clit. (up to 20k receptors versus 8k in the clit)   I know that drawing a parallel between male and female circumcision draws the ire of some force in the reddit hivemind, but in my opinion, as a cut male they are both mutilation and equally horrific.   Again, please do not.   Someone else said watch videos of the baby's faces as they're cut.
TwoXChromosomes X Try a mirena IUD until then!  Stops your period for the most part, IUDs are cheaper than anything else and more effective than sterilization. 
BabyBumps X Yes. We've been able to feel the baby from the outside since right around Christmas... so at about 24 weeks was the first time my SO felt the baby. Now the baby kicks a lot and squirms and he can feel MOST of the time, sometimes the baby stops moving when he puts his hand on my tummy. When you will LOOK pregnant depends on you. Some skinny women never really look pregnant. I didn't look pregnant for so long because I'm REALLY overweight. My weight started shifting. 
TwoXChromosomes X What about condoms? Or the pull-out method? They're both incredibly effective, when used properly. 
TwoXChromosomes X I completely understand your anxiety. I was soooo nervous before my first appointment as well. Anyhow, I guess I'll just go in the order that you asked the questions.  &gt;This is the practice closest to me: [1] ? Is that the right kind of place for me to go? I'm fucking lost about this. If that isn't the right kind of place, what is?  Taking into consideration that you are a sexually active lesbian, I really don't think that practice would be a good place for you. It seems to be extremely heteronormative and I really don't think you would feel comfortable telling them about your sex history. To get the best healthcare, you need to be honest with the medical staff, and the medical staff needs to be non-judgmental. I really don't foresee an old white guy from Alabama being non-judgmental with you.   I was checking out local places by you that are LGBT friendly and I couldn't find anyplace that specified that it was. Are you apart of any LGBT groups or know of anyone that you could ask to get recommendations for a good doctor? Because I think that would be your best bet. But if not, maybe the next best thing is to make an appointment with your local planned parenthood for a check up.  &gt;Additionally, what do I say when I call to ask for an appointment?  When you call them, tell them that you would like to make an appointment for a check-up and a pap smear, and tell them that it's your first time going to the gynecologist, and ask them what you should bring.  &gt;Also, I'm a sexually active lesbian. What do I put on the form when it asks if I'm sexually active? What do I say to the doctor?   You write down on the forms that you are sexually active. It will probably ask you how many partners have you had. List them and specify women. The doctor will probably ask you about your sexual history as well, and tell them.   &gt;Also, what can I be expecting in the appointment? What do I need to bring?  Arrive about 15 minutes early because you will be filling out a lot of forms with your medical history as well as your family's. Ask your family about their medical histories if you can because that is actually super important (your grandparents, parents, biological aunts and uncles, and siblings). Bring your insurance card and ID. But yeah, you may also want to ask the receptionist what you should bring as well when you make your appointment because the office may have other suggestions. But what I listed has been the norm.   And the exam! I almost forgot. After you fill out forms, you will get the typical weight, and blood pressure check, as well as temperature. The nurse will ask you the first day of your last period. And then she may or may not check you for anemia by pricking your finger to get a drop of blood. Then she may ask you to urinate into a cup (this may happen before all of the stuff while you're waiting to see the doctor. But of course you may be excluded from this because it's usually a pregnancy test thing. But depending on how they check for STI's, they may have you pee in a cup to check that way)   You'll then go into the examination room where the nurse will lay out a gown for your top and sheet to cover your lowers extremities. She will leave the room so that you can change into that stuff. (remember, you put the opening in the front, that is for the breast examination). Oh, and another thing, there has been a "socks or no socks" debate with new patients, I usually go for leaving my socks on so that I have at least have on some clothing. It's a psychological thing I do to make me feel more comfortable.  Ok. So the doctor will come in, ask you questions about your health, and discomforts. She will ask you to lay down so that she can check your breasts for any lumps. Afterward she will do the vaginal exam. She'll walk you through what she is doing and let you know anytime she is about to stick something in and what to expect so I won't go into too much detail here. After the speculum thing, she will probably tell you that she's going to stick her fingers up your vagina and press down on your pelvis. She's checking to see if your ovary health is good, and then that should be it. It's actually relatively fast and painless.   I can't really think of any questions that you should ask her, unless of course you find something worrisome in your family history, then talk about minimization/prevention. Ask her about possibly taking supplements and if you yourself have any health concerns (whether it be emotionally or physically) bring it up. Especially emotionally. I think a lot of people tend to forget this aspect of their health.   Lastly, try not to worry about the process. I know the first time is scary, but as you get older and go to the doctor more often, this will all be water under the bridge. Just know that you need to do this to take care of yourself. Oh, and if you have any physical insecurities, just remember, the doctor has seen it all, and nothing will shock her.         
TwoXChromosomes X I'd like to take a moment to point out that unwanted children are more likely to be abused, abandoned or worse, and the statistics would indicate these kids would be much more likely to become a burden in society.   I seem to remember a chapter in Freakonomics about how the falling crime rate in NY in the 80's (90's?) had more to do with women's access to safe and legal abortions and contraception than with the other crime control techniques. 
TwoXChromosomes X Cutting is wrong and so is your husband.  Like others have said, if your son really wants to be cut as an adult well that's his choice (he won't, and he'll be glad that he wasn't as a baby).
TwoXChromosomes X tampons are designed to absorb liquid where as toilet paper disintegrates in liquid. So why would you flush them?
TwoXChromosomes X If you start now, finish a pack before these events you have, just start the next pack right up, don't bother with the placebo pills from the first pack. You might have spotting but it should stave off getting your period until you finish the second pack.
BabyBumps X i think that's a lot like how i told my fiance. i was a couple of weeks late and had felt nauseous for the past couple of days, so i took a test, got a faint line and thought that meant "inconclusive." so i waited another day or 2, took another test and it was very clear. i think i came out of the bathroom and said something like "oh, well that explains it. i'm pregnant." i don't remember what his exact reaction was, but he was very excited about being a daddy. :)
TwoXChromosomes X 1 in 5  sexually active persons in America has herpes. 80% of those infected have no idea. The disease can remain dormant and still actively "shed" (be contagious) without any symptoms. At the end of the day, it's an inconvenient rash. Don't take it lightly, but realize that  if it doesn't work with him, you will have more partners that are also infected.  If you'd date someone with cold sores, this should be no different.
TwoXChromosomes X I have had cysts only a cpl, found with external ultrasounds, but they were seen as nothing to worry about, and certainly my pain was never attributed to them..
BabyBumps X Also you want to take your supplement either right before bed (so it has time to absorb on its own) or with something high in vitamin c (helps absorption). Things high in calcium actually hinder your absorption, so if your baby makes you crave "ALL THE DAIRY ITEMS" try and plan your supplement around those times when you know you will be eating a bunch of it.
TwoXChromosomes X I took plan B and had a hellish month.. I got my period within few days of  taking the pill and it stuck around for nearly a month. Along with breast tenderness and general symptoms of PMS. It ended after I started birth control pills.  Take a test after a month.. you should be ok. 
BabyBumps X Wow you were so little to begin with! Your big pregnant belly was so cute and gorgeous! Do you ever miss it?
BabyBumps X My first OB appt was at 10 weeks too. It definitely sucked and I was a nervous wreck while waiting but once I got that sono I couldn't be happier. My baby looked like a little gummy bear. She had limbs and you could even see her little toes. Some of my friends got their sonos ar like 6 or 7 weeks and you can't even tell it's a baby. It looks like a little seed. I was happy that the first time I saw my baby she looked like an acrual human so I'm glad my first appt was at 10 weeks. Hopefully you'll end up feeling the same!!
BabyBumps X I agree with the normalcy of this. My first pregnancy they told me "We don't even see women until 12 weeks. There is no point in a healthy pregnancy."  My others have been spread out between 6 and 8 weeks, and that was always a confirmation appointment, the only time I had an ultrasound in the first trimester was when I didn't know how pregnant I was (turned out to be 6 weeks) because I was having health issues and didn't realize I COULD be pregnant, because I was taking birth control pills.  This baby the only ultrasound I get all pregnancy, provided there are no more issues, was at 19 weeks for the anatomy scan and checking the placement of the placenta.  And this has been my experience with 3 different care providers in 3 different states over the past decade.
TwoXChromosomes X But not using protection shouldn't be an option! The moment when you get to stop using prophylactic protection is at least 3 months into a monogamous relationship after you have both been STI tested. Until then the price of sex is condoms. If someone you want to fuck doesn't want to use one, don't fuck them. There is no other way of 'making sure' your friend is clean.
TwoXChromosomes X Can you ask your doc about daily acidophilus supplements? And check to see if your lube (if you use lube) has glycerin, which can cause yeast infections? Make sure you keep all your lady parts clean/dry after exercising/showering. Hope you get it resolved stat!
TwoXChromosomes X But it should also be added that there is no shame in formula feeding. The amount of shit I get for not breastfeeding is unreal. I can't breastfeed, it was at a point where my baby would scream in hunger because my supply was so low, I didn't realize until I tried pumping, one breast only gave an ounce after 3 or so hours of pumping, and the other gave nothing.  I'd rather have a happy baby than struggle through breast feeding. Formula has been a life saver!
BabyBumps X We're about the same week (I'm 21 currently), didn't have any morning sickness, and I've only gained 7lbs total so far.  We think the beer drinking weight has redistributed to baby weight since I quit drinking.  :)
TwoXChromosomes X I was on and off the pill for several years (maybe not the best-advised thing to do), but every time I went on the pill, my boobs got bigger. For some, that would be great, but I'm now an H cup, which is a bit ridiculous on a 5'3'' frame. Nevermind the crazy things those hormones to do you.  I got my Mirena about a year ago (free in the UK), and I LOVE it. Yes, the pain on insertion was like my worst period cramps x 10, but that lasted about 30 seconds. It took a couple of months to calm down (as they said it would), but since then, I hardly have a period any more - maybe 3 days of spotting, nothing really worth even a tampon (moar money saved!). I've always been pretty regular, and I'm still regular, even though it's not much of an event any more. The hormones are minimal, so I think I even lost weight. Friends I've known that went on to the copper IUD say that their cramps are worse and periods heavier.  Added bonus: I've recently moved to the other side of the world, and so it's saving me the hassle of finding a doctor to find a similar pill and prescribe it, and of course saving me lots of money!  **TL;DR:** Pill made boobs bigger, me crazy. Mirena awesome - very minor periods, saves you money!
Parenting X I totally disagree; I didn't make a big deal of it with my daughter and she just forgot about wanting them. She was hooked on binkies and would go everywhere with one, until I decided she was old enough not to (just after her 2nd birthday). I just didn't give her a binky when she asked for one in the morning, I gave her a cup of milk instead, and by the time she'd finished the milk she had forgotten about the binky and never asked for it again.
TwoXChromosomes X I have actually found my vagina to be tighter post pregnancy. Mostly because it got no use for 6 weeks afterwards! In fact, some positions that used to be fine can be a bit painful now, but we're working on it.   I gained 30 lbs while pregnant and lost it all within 4 weeks without trying (just breastfeeding). But I was fat already when I got pregnant, so it's not like I'm looking great or anything at my Pre pregnancy weight. The biggest problem is everything is kind of flabby now, when it wasn't before, but that fades with time (my husband even said he noticed it going away).
BabyBumps X This right here. Most of mine were the physically hardening of my stomach, my husband could even tell that my stomach was tighter! I notice the tightness before any cramps (rarely ever).
Parenting X What particularly struck a chord with me was:  &gt; I believe it would have been an act of love to abort him  I consider many terminations to be a form of euthanasia.  When you learn shortly after the first trimester that your baby is almost certainly incapable of being born alive (eg one of the "lethal" trisomies) then surely it is more ethical, more compassionate to terminate before its neural networks etc become even more developed, and it potentially dies in pain?
BabyBumps X Your body might just be really sensitive to the new/increased hormones.  Possibly you ovulated earlier than you think, and so are a bit further along...  Or MAYBE it's twins!!  Anyway, I feel for you, babe.  The first trimester is really hard.  I had waves of nausea before I found out I was pregnant (around week 5/6), but it didn't really kick in for me until week 7/8, at which time I started throwing up multiples times a day.  That lasted until about week 14 for me.  I did have a few good and symptom free days during that time, which made me worry about miscarrying.  Ha.  It's kind of a mind fuck... but the symptoms always came back.  I still throw up now... only 4 or so times a week, and it's pretty much limited to in the middle of the night or morning... so, there's that at least.  Hang in there.  Sleep and rest as much as you want and can.    Also, I agree with you.  So far being pregnant feels almost exactly like being hungover.  Without the fun the night before.
BabyBumps X My tests the first few days (and I tested for a week!) were all pretty faint, and I was always using first morning urine.  It's possible the dye in the first test was stronger.  Also, on the second test, you most likely saw an evaporation line, not an actual positive.  Try again in the morning.  Also consider picking up a digital test, which won't leave any question as to the faintness of the line.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Are you sure the state requires her to physically look at and see the picture herself and not just to go in for an ultra sound so the doctor can confirm the fetus is dead?  [Yes]( -texas-abortion-idUSTRE81605220120207).  Fuck Texas.
BabyBumps X Also a pro-tip from when I was pregnant with my first. When I went for the 20 week ultrasound, she was sleeping and wouldn't move! The tech (who also did my second ultrasound) told me when I came back to drink something sugary while I was on my way/waiting in the waiting room. Since baby will get some benefit from it, they will be more active, and more likely to cooperate.  Other than that, they're checking for any abnormalities, size, and can tell you the gender if you want to know! They typically will ask. Just know that they may tell you that if you're having a girl it could be inaccurate. It's easy to think you see girl parts when they're not, not so much the other way around. ;)  Good luck, and enjoy! Seriously, it was really fun getting the 20 week ultrasound. And you'll likely get tons of pictures! I still have all of mine from last time.
TwoXChromosomes X You should definitely be using different absorbencies (?) on different days. It's a pain, I know, but it is safer in regards to TSS and will help you with pain/leaking problems. I am partial to Tampax because that's what I have always used, so I can't give you a properly unbiased opinion in regards to brands. They sell multi-packs so you'll get lights (those spotty days when you aren't bleeding enough to fill a regular tampon and it hurts to take out), regulars (for the average days), and supers (the days when you are leaking). I have a very heavy flow on days 2-3, so like you, I almost instantly leak with regular tampons that day. As far as TSS, there is always a risk, but it sounds like you are being cautious about not leaving them in too long and using the correct absorbency will help even more.  Honestly, I would suggest just skipping to the Divacup if you aren't feeling comfortable with tampons. There's no reason to get the hang of them if you don't have to. It takes a bit to get the hang of the cup, but I'm sure you can do it. I just used it successfully for an entire period for the first time - this is about the 3rd month I've tried. I really just had to get a better idea of what my body was doing during my period to make sure it was in the right place at the right time. I've also heard some other helpful tips I can share with you if you're interested. Good luck! 
BabyBumps X Are you getting your anatomy scan at 14 weeks? I thought they did it only at around 20 weeks because of size? Either way, good luck and anatomy scans are quite long.
TwoXChromosomes X This is perfectly safe. What brand of pill are you on? Does it have one constant level of hormones throughout the pack, or does it have different levels each week? It makes a difference for how you run the packs together.  You might have spotting, but I don't think there's any way to predict whether you will without actually trying it.
TwoXChromosomes X The issue here isn't that she has to have another ultrasound, that's fairly standard practice, it's the fact that she is being forced to look at the screen, or have the person performing the ultrasound describe what's on screen to her.
AskWomen X I get the same thing when my cycle jumps, which is quite often and very annoying. Give it a few more days and if you still don't get your period, you may benefit from a visit to your doctor. 
BabyBumps X I had this exact feeling in the beginning of my pregnancy.  I explained it to my doctor but I don't think she quite understood.  I ended up in the ER one night with a urinary tract infection and a kidney stone (the pain was excruciating).  Ask your doctor to check you for a urinary tract infection. 
TwoXChromosomes X I do it all the time. (I'm on a monophasic pill). Ive never had any problems, spotting, not even increased flow when I have a period after skipping. My doctor told me it is completely safe. Triphasic pills may be different though - I can only speak to my own experience.
BabyBumps X Agreed - the doctor does suck. I've had UTIs before and they don't always burn.  In fact I had one last week and thought it was just the baby pressing really hard on my bladder.  All the other symptoms: having to pee all the time, urgently needing to pee, etc. are all pretty common pregnancy complaints and you may not be able to distinguish the two.  I sure couldn't.  And UTIs need to be treated quickly in pregnancy because they can turn in to kidney infections much much quicker than normal.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on Cerazette, I get it for free as I'm in the UK but from the prices online its about 3 a month.  No side effects though it has stopped my periods but I was put on it for that reason as mine were anaemia inducing heavy and I was missing out on weeks of school/uni because I was vomiting continuously whenever I did have a period.  Can't remember what other pills I've tried but they normally just make me more ill and headachey and they didn't do anything to control my periods. 
TwoXChromosomes X I got pregnant only 3 months into my relationship, after a lifetime of being 80% sure that I never wanted kids.  I didn't like being around babies and had never even held one!  What followed was the hardest decision I ever had to make, but I eventually decided to continue with the pregnancy for a couple reasons: my boyfriend had wanted to be a father for a while, and his family was supportive so if I seriously couldn't handle motherhood, I knew they would have adopted the child.  The other reason is that I knew she was going into a loving environment and that she would have everything she needed, so it didn't seem right for me to have an abortion just because "it wasn't the right time".  In the end, I fell head over heels in love with my daughter and my relationship with my boyfriend continued to flourish - we recently got engaged and couldn't be happier.  Right now I'm a stay at home mom by choice, but my own mother raised my brother and I while getting her masters degree so I know it's completely possible to pursue your dreams while being a mom.  The way I see it, the child isn't "unwanted" if your boyfriend is attached to it already.  Perhaps have a similar talk with him to the one I had with mine - is he prepared to care for this child if you are not ready to be a mom? Does he realize the responsibility involved with being a single father? Does he have enough love to give to this child, and does he have the resources to support him or her?  If your relationship is going to end by getting an abortion anyway (doesn't sound 100% but your boyfriend seems to be hinting at that right now), consider whether or not it's in everyone's best interest to continue with the pregnancy - best case scenario, you fall in love with your child and step up to the plate of motherhood... worse case scenario, the child has an absent or visiting mom, BUT a loving dad, and your boyfriend gets to experience fatherhood (which it sounds like he wants to do).  You should definitely talk to him about all of this to see if he realizes what he seemingly wants to get into.  Pregnancy, birth, and potentially giving up a child is no walk in the park, so you have to consider your own feelings in the matter as well obviously.  (I was 22 when I got pregnant as well and in my own experience, it wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be, but every situation is different due to many different factors!)
AskWomen X Nothing to worry about.  Especially if you've been stressed or something or more/less physically active than usual.   White discharge and even brownish discharge sometimes is normal, probably just a slightly different pH than usual.  You might be a little dehydrated if you've been sick. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was advised by the doctor who inserted it to check my strings every month after my period (which is apparently the most likely time for it to expel- which although unlikely, is possible). Very low, but not zero maintenance. Were you told the same thing?
BabyBumps X Ummm...I won't go into detail, because I don't want scare any mommies-to-be who are hoping for an orgasmic, natural birth...but I just gave birth to my daughter less than 5 months ago (she is not even my first baby, and she only weighed 4-1/2 lbs) completely naturally, and orgasm was the LAST thing on my mind.   It is wonderful if some women are truly able to feel this way when giving birth. Personally, after giving birth to two of my own, I find it difficult to believe.  And maybe no one else feels this way, but I am a little weirded out by it.
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds like a partner notification letter- someone with an STI listed you as a recent partner.  Some areas do this, but it does not mean HIV.  Several treatable infections (syphilis, gonorrhea) will create partner notifications.  
TwoXChromosomes X I think yoou should do what is best for you... but i wouldnt abort. You dont know for sure that the child would be in pain. My sister has CP and she is on of the happiest people in the world. Personally, i dont think it is up to me to decide how the childs life "may" turn out. If you really do not think this child has a chance of living a life of happiness nor do you think you can handle it, well that is your decision. I admire you for thinking of both sides though. Best of luck with your situation...hugs!
BabyBumps X we're waiting for birth... hubby and I are convinced girl, son is saying girl but hoping for boy (preparing for worst, hoping for best, totally my son) pretty much everyone else I know is convinced I'm having a boy, except a lot of people here on babybumps who apparently think baby looks like a girl.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;And let's face it...if this man has expressed not wanting a child but the woman does not believe in abortion then why are they having sex in the first place?  Why are you assuming the woman in this scenario is against abortions?  Not all women who get pregnant and want to keep the child are against abortions.  You said it yourself:  &gt;understand that aborting an undeveloped fetus may be a difficult decision to make.   Even those who are pro-choice and didn't think they wanted a child yet can have their minds changed once they are actually pregnant.  Abstinence shouldn't be the only choice a man has to avoid the risk of paying 18 years of child support payments while a woman can simply take emergency contraceptives or get an abortion.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think I understand your second sentence. Why would only allowing one choice help to determine which choice is more ethical in a specific situation?   And wouldn't it be easy to argue that abortion is ethical in the case of a woman who may die in bringing the child to term? Or is the killing of someone that can't suffer worse somehow than the killing of someone who can? 
TwoXChromosomes X This is exactly what I plan to do if/when I'm ever pregnant.   8 1/2 months pregnant? "Oh! when are you due?!"   "...I'm not pregnant..."  Trolling people would be fun :D
TwoXChromosomes X To the point where the pain radiates back through to your back muscles and your spine, and can even cause headaches and such.  Imagine the worst gas you've ever ever had. The sort that's like a very sharp stabbing pain cause it's really trapped in your lower abdomen. Sometimes, it's like that, with general pain all the way around, and there's no way of releasing said pain, since it's not gas.
TwoXChromosomes X Why not? It could help. I always skip one period too; so six weeks of (working!) pills and then one week of no pills and crying. You could ask your doc, but I've been told that the whole period-while-on-the-pill thing could be skipped without harm. Breakthrough bleeding especially in the last two weeks of the six weeks could be a problem, but I'm lucky.
TwoXChromosomes X This won't cure it!  As someone else mentioned, this just raised the pH of your urine which decreases the burning, but actually makes your urine MORE susceptible to bacteria overgrowth.  Your pee should naturally be slightly acidic (like your hair, skin, and nails) this is to prevent infection.  Life grows at about neutral pH so while your symptoms might be reduced it can get worse and lead to a kidney infection.  If you have a UTI go to the doctor!  edit: I a word
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think you would have bled from anywhere except the natural shedding that is from the uterus.  If the bleeding were from irritation or infection there should be discomfort or odor.  So, I don't think the strange thing was a mucous plug (which would have formed if you had a pregnancy).  I think the strange thing was totally normal thing, a [nabothian cyst]( ) .  A mucous plug is actually like you described, except maybe more mucousy, but a clot can look just like you described.    Since you've considered a pregnancy, it seems likely that you may have been exposed to STIs?  Either way a trip to the doctor is in order.  Don't be scared!  The most likely thing is really the most likely thing.  You probably had a nabothian cyst (super, super common, and harmless) and a period. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was in Target today shopping for non-clothing items and I was surprised by how cute a lot of their clothes have gotten lately, so you could try there.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Being responsible does that.  ask any gyno, "being responsible" means 2 forms on contraception. Condoms AND oral contraceptive. I once had 3 condoms break on me within a week. At the time I was NOT on BC, and I had to Plan B it twice. it wasn't 10 minutes after condom number 3 broke (all different brands) that I was talking to my clinic about a bc scrip. 
BabyBumps X I can't even walk by the end of the day. I have this pain right down the middle of my pelvis and it feels like its going to snap.  I was born with hip dysplasia too so I'm sure that's not helping either. I just done understand why my OB hasn't said anything about SPD considering I've been talking about this pain for weeks and weeks. This is not "normal". I should still be able to walk damn it. 
BabyBumps X I have that same middle pain! Along with lower back and hip. I also have a feeling of a pulled muscle in my groin that is constant. When I turn in bed I hear a popping noise. And using only my left leg, such as using stairs or trying to stand on one leg to put on pants, would kill me! Hope you find relief, I know how you feel :(
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, Wiki says it's used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 
TwoXChromosomes X On a side-note, would there be a market for a sex-only pill? I'm not sure how viable it would be, but if we would be able to suppress the ability to get impregnated for a short amount of time, it would make things easier on women that suffer from the side-effects of conventional hormonal birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X and so say all of us! It only takes one 'fukfukfukfukfuk FUCK!!!' to set us straight.   I personally use the copper IUD because i can't remember to take the pill everyday and I don't like the side effects. 
TwoXChromosomes X That would just be allowing people to shame women for having sex. The primary function of birth control, is to prevent unwanted pregnancies which should be of course, what these people are all after, since unwanted pregnancies can result in a child born into poverty and reliant on welfare which of course is evil socialism. Or worse yet, result in an abortion which is of course cold blooded murder. (sarcasm font)
BabyBumps X Sounds like you are probably having contractions (whether they are BH or "the real thing" remains to be seen). Keep an eye on their frequency/duration...my midwives recommended calling the office if there were 4 or more in an hour before 37 weeks.  If they stop or slow down with changes in activity or position they are almost definitely BH contractions. Also, make sure you are drinking plenty of water. Dehydration is one of the main causes of preterm labor.
TwoXChromosomes X I've heard/used this before. Helps fight yeast or bv infections. It works :) (and yup, gotta use unsweetened, like plain greek yogurt)
BabyBumps X I couldn't get my husband to read much of anything!  For labor, we took a lamaze class and I showed him a part of the expectant father.  But our labor doula was better.  I want everyone woman to get one even if they have a plan for an epidural as they probably won't give it to you soon as you'd want it. My husband was super involved and asked her a lot of question.  And doulas just want dads to be comfy with them so she was thrilled!!
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with Amber_Owl! If you go on antibiotics for the UTI, make sure you eat probiotic yogurt or get probiotic pills. Otherwise you risk getting a yeast infection (I know from experience.... it sucked hardcore).
TwoXChromosomes X There is research showing that douching with hydrogen peroxide is an effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis because it can restore normal vaginal flora and pH levels. [Source]( ).
TwoXChromosomes X BULL-fucking-SHIT.  An arrythmia is a minor heart condition, people with more severe stress levels should be more worried about having kids. Something else is up with him or else he has been severely misinformed.   If you want kids, have them. Get good pre-natal care and give birth the way you want to. You will be as fine as the rest of the world's women (there are always risks no matter what, but we somehow keep on tickin')  
TwoXChromosomes X Urine tests are surprisingly as accurate a blood tests. Both kinds of test would return a positive result in the case of extra-uterine pregnancy because they detect human chorionic gonadotropin which is always present during pregnancy. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I embarked on my usual regime or eating a lot of live yoghurt, smearing it around my ladyparts as well  TIL...
TwoXChromosomes X I actually went on a continuous pill cycle to just not have periods for a while (I have an IUD now). I really, really loved it - there was some spotting at first while my body adjusted but being period-free was great. Warning - I had a doctor advise me to have a period every 3-4 for months .... when I did it was horrendous, much worse than my normal periods. So after that I stopped having them completely. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have been there and understand what it is like, and when it comes down to it I don't think I could have an abortion myself. Thankfully, like you, it was just a scare and I was not pregnant. However, if I was pregnant and chose to have the child, I would not financially tie up the father of the child if he let me know up front he didn't want the baby. I agree they are both equally responsible for using contraception, either something went wrong or they both mutually did not use it. This is both of them together. Unfortunately, the decision to abort would be hers alone if she so chose it, and I just sincerely feel that men should have some kind of protection in this regard so they are not stuck with children they do not want any more than women are. If she is keeping the baby, she wants the baby. Plain and simple. That's great. Unfortunately, she can't support the baby. The person she got pregnant with does not want the baby. Should he have to support the baby just because she wants the accidental baby they made? And if you think he does, then do you also think a woman should have to carry a baby to term if the man wants the baby and the woman does not?
TwoXChromosomes X I will give you my own experience. To me, it never mattered if it's a man or a woman doctor. You say you are a lesbian - would a woman doctor make you *more* comfortable or *less* comfortable? What is right for me doesn't need to be right for you.  Age does seem to be a factor for me: I found that I feel more at ease with younger doctors, because (from my personal experience) they seem more laid back about sex (or have been trained not to act judgmentally)and more knowledgeable about things like new form of contraceptives etc.  When you call you ask for a checkup, and you might wish to say this is your first time.  Regardless of your sexual orientation, you should disclose you are sexually active. Some things (like herpes or HPV) can be passed on through non-penetrative sex also. This way doctors know if this is a risk. You should also disclose you have no kids - this will usually lead them to use a smaller speculum for the exam.  My "first time" was unpleasant mostly because I did not know what to expect: Which will probably be a breast exam and a vaginal exam. I had the ill fortune of having a sullen-looking doctor who did not speak a word and it made me very uncomfortable. I now request - quite politely - if they could tell me what they will be doing to me - step by step - and I found to me this helps.   But everyone is different. Communication is important. Also, if they do pap smear, you should ask if they will call you with the results or if you should call them...    
TwoXChromosomes X I got it a few month ago.  The cramps have subsided, and I don't see any noticeable change in my acne or weight, but I was on hormonal BC before.  How could less hormones be worse? Periods are more like spotting/ blood-tinged normal discharge and can go on for quite some time, but I'm expecting it'll all but disappear within the year
BabyBumps X If you have the choice, I would just choose to have more appointments to keep an eye on it, and have a cerclage put in if it starts to shorten too much. May mean you have to go on pelvic rest, but I think you have to be on pelvic rest if you have a cerclage anyway (Pelvic rest, no sex... uh and a few other things. That's just the part that I hated. lol)
BabyBumps X It's not serious itching (not like Pupps, no rash, and lotion helps). Thanks for asking though! My little sister actually got pupps in her seventh month.
TwoXChromosomes X That's not what I'm saying at all. I am saying if you want to have sex and not get pregnant then use contraception. That's a completely different thing.   As I said previously abortion can cause a lot of problems, so it should not be considered contraception, as there is a lot more to consider when going for that than contraception. Abortion does not prevent you getting pregnant, whereas contraception including emergency contraception will). If you don't want to get pregnant/get your partner pregnant, you *must* use contraception.
TwoXChromosomes X The waiting periods are really common and aren't because the clinics can't get to patients quickly enough.  They are simply legal maneuvers to try to guilt women into keeping the fetus.  [This] is a summation of laws and state-by-state funding for "medically necessary" abortions.  Some states (see South Dakota) only fund if life is in danger, other health consequences be damned.  Ultrasounds are, in many cases, medically necessary.  What's unnecessary is requiring women to see the ultrasound, listen to the fetal heartbeat, and/or listen to a detailed description of the fetus, which is what the [Texas law requires.]( -texas-abortion-idUSTRE80C2BD20120114)  Additionally, why should the government mandate ultrasounds that are [already standard procedure?]( -abortion/texas-abortion-laws-28992.htm)    That second link includes a description of the type of "counseling" women are required to undergo, some of which is not scientifically based.  For example, there is no evidence for a link between abortion and breast cancer.  These laws are ridiculous, and they are the "anti-choice" laws that we all get worked up over.  They obviously restrict access to abortion as best they can and don't trust women to make the best decision for themselves.  It's incredibly harmful, and it only directly hurts women, hence the "War on Women."
BabyBumps X Hey... I'm way late on replies but I wanted to say thank you.  :)  And tell your hubby not to be scared, it'll happen to your bump too!
BabyBumps X I had feet in my ribs A LOT as my baby got bigger.  And if I would push a little out of the way something else would get jammed and poked elsewhere into my body parts.  It's nicer to have my little one on the outside but I miss those movements and wiggles on the inside sometimes too.
TwoXChromosomes X wow, thanks for doing this ama! I'm getting my Mirena removed soon. Mine's also hitting the five year mark. I'm one of the rare ones that got dizzy as hell when they inserted it and had bitchy bad cramps for the whole day of insertion. It got better though. I'm worried about getting it removed, but it sounds like removal should be easier than the insertion.  -how bad was cramping of the removal? was it like the cramp you felt when they put it in, like that? -how bad/heavy was your period after getting Mirena removed? was it like your periods before? are your periods now heavier or lighter? thank you! :D
TwoXChromosomes X I mean, both of those things are correct. Standardly, when you are getting to being menopausal you do tend to have a depleting egg supply and you are indeed at the end of your fertile period. However, it has to do with the production of hormones, not the presence of eggs. A woman can run out of viable eggs long before menopause starts.    
TwoXChromosomes X Why is taking the pill to prevent pregnancy not a health reason? It shouldn't matter why a woman takes contraception. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've heard it can be very painful, and my doctor won't insert an IUD unless you already have a child or are at least 30.  I would love to have one and not have to worry about it, though.  
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with you 100%, healthcare in the US is abhorrent.  I was just pointing out that this woman's story about not having access to healthcare is not true, because the government *will* pay for pregnant women.  As for paid maternity leave, it is not guaranteed at all by the government. Some jobs offer it, but it varies wildly. The best I've ever heard of was 6 months for the mother and 4 weeks for the father, paid by the company. But the average is more like 4-6 weeks for the mother, 1-2 weeks for the father. A lot of people use their vacation time or take a short-term medical leave when they have a child.  There IS a law that guarantees 3 months of leave for birth/adoption, BUT, it only applies to some companies (with 50+ employees) and it's only *unpaid* time off.  Again, it's ridiculous.
Parenting X yes, we're using the "calma" nipple from medela...it requires suction to get the milk out, simulating the breast a bit.   I'd give it a thumb up...kind of a pain to clean, but our baby eats out of it and still goes back to the boob, so it can't be all bad :D
TwoXChromosomes X I've been doing research on this. It seems femme cup and others sit lower in the vagina (lower than tampons even) so no sexy times. But the soft cup sits way up there at the base of the cervix. Both seem seem awkward to get it in though. Maybe I'm just too used to tampons. If/when you try, can u report back? 
TwoXChromosomes X And yet they never say anything about how viagra shouldn't be paid for by insurance.    I think it's really dangerous to defend hormonal birth control on medical need alone; by doing that, it seems like we're on the defensive, and agreeing that the most legitimate use of hormones is for the medical needs it helps with. It makes us sound like we're not strong on the right to access birth control for what it is, but rather need to shore it up with other effects. Do you see what I'm saying?  They already know it isn't just "sluts" who use birth control: all the married people who only have one or two kids are doing it some how.   
BabyBumps X I know it sounds selfish (because it is), but I don't want to have to give things up or sacrifice just because I am pregnant. And motherhood is going to involve SO MUCH MORE OF THIS. 
AskWomen X I took Seasonal for a few months. I spotted for 27 days straight during the first pack. I ended up quitting in the middle of the second pack bc the spotting happened again. I'd rather just get my period as expected every month than deal with the sporadic spotting. Good luck with that!
TwoXChromosomes X Huh, that's really odd. I tried 2 different pills (not including the one I'm on now) and both of them either made the cramping worse or gave me other icky side effects. Oh well, I'd rather put up with cramping than irregular, freakishly heavy, 4-day long periods.
TwoXChromosomes X Does anybody have statistics on how many women take it for medical reasons vs. purely as birth control?
TwoXChromosomes X It should be fine then to start a new pack. Depending on the way your body reacts and how reliably you take your pills (i.e. same time every day) you may experience some spotting/breakthrough bleeding, but your period should be shorter/lighter. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, a cone biopsy is different than a [cervical biopsy]( -cancer/colposcopy-and-cervical-biopsy). The one you had was probably for abnormal cells found on or around the front of the cervix. The [cone biopsy]( -cancer/cone-biopsy-conization-for-abnormal-cervical-cell-changes) is for when they find the abnormal cells up in the inner canal of the cervix. They have to open your cervix and cut a cone shaped chunk out of it - they try to cut it all out and even some of the marginal tissue that may be okay. It's possible that they go in there and find cancer, which is why I'm kind of freaking out along with the pain and possible risks (rare future infertility, miscarriage, ... ughgghhghgh
BabyBumps X I had my daughter 2 weeks ago and even though I was induced, I did not get the epidural. I did take IV pain medicine, but that was to help lower my blood pressure as much as to help manage the pain. I am terrified of needles as well, but with being induced and having Group B Strep, I had to have an IV anyway. Besides, the IV is done before things get going, so you can concentrate on working through that stick.
BabyBumps X Even though I edited:  I must have heard the heartbeat at about 5 weeks with the pregnancy that miscarried because when I went back for my appointment at about 9 weeks, that's when we found out the baby had stopped progressing.  Even though we had heard the heartbeat four weeks earlier.  Even if the count was off, I don't think it would have been that off, would it?
BabyBumps X My mum had very quick labours, and with my first, I went from 4cms to 10cms in an hour and a half, and pushed her out in one rather big push. I feel like my experience was very similar to hers, so perhaps you might go early. We'll see!  
BabyBumps X Ok, I think I'm still a little confused, but I'll try to answer your modified question. I had an ultrasound at five weeks because of a possible ectopic, and they were only able to see a gestational sac and fetal pole at that point, which is normal. By nine weeks I heard and saw the heartbeat at my dating ultrasound. Also by nine weeks, I could pick up the heart beat on a cheap, at home doppler. But I'm slender with a posterior placenta, which is ideal for picking it up that early.  Some doctors offices can't find the heart beat with a Doppler and won't even try because a) every woman's anatomy is different and they don't want to scare someone when everything is fine, and b) many places don't do ultrasound until 12 weeks as standard practice. Not because of machinery.   Hope that helps.
BabyBumps X In the US my first OB visit included a full u/s, I got to see my peanuts and hear their heartbeats at only 8 weeks. From all of my friends and family that have had babies (or are pregnant) 8 week u/s+heartbeats are quite normal.
TwoXChromosomes X There are numerous factors for a late period, pregnancy is only one of them. Don't panic yet, just take a pregnancy test so you'll know.
BabyBumps X after mine I hardly bled at all. I only used panty liners. Totally wasted all the pads I had bought.
BabyBumps X I had these feelings post partum.  I immediately regretted our baby.  It's probably hormones honestly. Once you get used to it, you won't remember what you did before having a baby. Now I realize my son is pretty awesome. Even if he was up before the sun this morning :)
TwoXChromosomes X You're "supposed" to gain between 25 and 35 pounds if you start off at an average weight. But pregnancy affects everyone so differently. One of my classmates gained 100 pounds while pregnant. 100... Like she turned into two of herself.   She looks exactly like she did before the baby now. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think it would lead to *more* deaths of women than the number of unborn fetuses that would be "saved" if abortions were no longer legal.  However, it would lead to lots of women's deaths and, in my opinion, the life of a woman is more valuable than the life of a zygote/fetus. 
BabyBumps X I'm 35 weeks and the doctor still has a problem finding the heartbeat occasionally. Last time, that resulted in an ultrasound. I first saw the heartbeat at about 6 weeks, and heard it at my next appointment.
BabyBumps X My labor was nothing like any of my mother's.  She had 1 emergency c-section (that healed within a week), and 2 very fast natural births after that.  I had hours and hours of pushing, to no avail, and a c-section with tons of complications.   
BabyBumps X My mother had four kids "like a cat having kittens," as my aunt likes to say. She never used pain medication and doesn't recall that the birth were particularly bad.  I developed preeclampsia and gave birth by emergency c-section at 32 weeks.  My sister went healthily to full term and beyond, but then was in strong labor for 24 hours before getting pitocin; the baby took another 12 hours after that.  So in our cases, like mother was not like daughter. Oh well.
BabyBumps X Have you tried taking B6 vitamins? If you take those, plus your prenatals, they may do you some good. I had very slight morning sickness, I never vomited, but there were a few times when I found myself sitting beside the toilet just in case. The B6 vitamins helped ease the nausea a lot, at least for me. I hope you start feeling better soon! 
TwoXChromosomes X He's so right and shit like this proves it:&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;   "It's called a "wrongful birth" bill and it's all about preventing women from having an abortion, even if it kills them. The Arizona Senate passed a bill this week that gives doctors a free pass to not inform pregnant women of prenatal problems because such information could lead to an abortion." -senate-passes-bill-allowing-doct\ ors-to-not-inform-women-of-prenatal-issues-to-prevent-abortions/ 
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on what your weight was pre-pregnancy. For me, my doctor wanted me to gain no more than 15 lbs. So far, so good. (I've only gained 2lbs from pre-pregnancy.) For smaller women, it's considered ok to gain up to 30 lbs. There is a period of time where you can gain a lb a week and not be considered gaining to fast, during the third trimester.
BabyBumps X do you know what your actual numbers are? Some doctors think subclinical thyroidism is "fine" in a non-pregnant woman (I have subclinical this pregnancy so I'm taking levothyroxine every morning, just a small dose compared to what I was taking with full blown thyroidism!) but many doctors do not think that even subclinical is a healthy level and should also be treated.
TwoXChromosomes X I guess I'm at the far end of the relatively painless experience of the Paragard.  I've had very light periods that last about 3 days and no cramps for years now and was worried that the copper IUD would change that.  It didn't.  Insertion was horrible.  But I'm a big baby when it comes to strangers poking around in my sensitive bits so when I say that if they were interrogating me I would have told them everything I know, it probably wasn't really that bad.  It was extremely uncomfortable and pinchy going in.  After that, it was mildly uncomfortable for about three days, felt like bad cramping, but nothing that Ibuprofen couldn't handle, and I was very conscious of sitting in certain positions that felt like it put pressure on my uterus.  For the next month or two my cervix would do this little twitching thing occasionally.  That was odd, but not at all painful or disruptive; just kind of curious.  My first two or three periods were heavier than normal, probably 5 or 6 days, but still no cramps really.  After that everything went back to normal.  This sounds a little crazy, but I had a stern talk with my reproductive system and told it this IUD was now it's new best friend and was going to be there for a while so everyone better play nicely.  Two years later and no problems, no expulsion, no cramps or heavy periods and absolutely no regrets.  My favorite part is that there's no hormones.  They haven't worked well for me in the past.
TwoXChromosomes X Is he crazy?  My understanding is that most women gain 3-5 lbs first trimester (although some lose due to morning sickness) and then it's about 1 lb gain per week.  Average women should gain between 30-35 lbs and underweight women can gain more like 40 lbs.  That's what it says in EVERY pregnancy guide I've come across.  Also what my nurse and OB told me.
TwoXChromosomes X have had my mirena since december 2011 so i'm still in the adjustment stage. insertion was brief and not as painful as i thought it would be. i was given medication to dilate my cervix. spotting like crazy- not enough for a tampon or maxi pad, but i have to use pantiliners now because i've ruined some panties. right now i'm on the heaviest flow i've had since december, it's lasted about 4 days and i am bleeding like i used to on the pill. no weight gain, pms or breast tenderness. checking for the strings can be difficult for me (short fingers)
TwoXChromosomes X The first and obvious answer is to stop using them immediately. Buy a different box of what you usually use. Actually, if you're having problems now it might be wise to just stick with pads if you can. Secondly, if the issues aren't going away, take a trip to your doctor. It's likely you've gotten a yeast or bacterial infection.   My college roommate was extremely sensitive to them; they gave her yeast infections so she couldn't use them. I've used them before and didn't have those kinds of problems but the scent of them mixed with... everything else was HORRIBLE.
TwoXChromosomes X Wow, I guess my periods were worse than I realized, since I soak through a super every hour for three days!  Being able to go three hours on one tampon is super light for me, and makes up the other four days of my typical period.  Thankfully I don't have bad cramping and only get migraines the day before, and I have magic anti-migraine pills now :-)
BabyBumps X Sorry- this is a long one :-)   I know your frustration with researching the injections online. As you mentioned before, the injection is the only thing you can do at this point to prevent preterm labor. That is also the mindset I had going into it. The research is not conclusive that it *always* prevents preterm labor. More so, there is evidence that it CAN and HAS prevented preterm labor in women who have had a singleton, preterm birth prior. It is progesterone, which you already naturally have in your body. It is just giving you an extra amount of it, because progesterone is calming to the uterus. One thing you have to consider is that at least half of preterm labor/deliveries have no known cause. After my first baby was born over 2 months early without warning or any prior complications, I didnt know what to do or think. *With my first, I discovered at my 31 week appt that I was in preterm labor, 3cm dilated and 90% effaced. The doctor and hospital did everything they could to stop it, but after 6 days on incredibly high doses of magnesium, baby was born. I had no prior warning. I didnt think I was feeling contractions at all. I had a tinge of spotting around week 28 or 29, but it was barely anything- and then a light amount of blood the day of my 31 week appt.*   No one could give me an answer. I just wanted to know why, and no one knew. I desperately wanted to have another baby, but I was terrified of the unknown. I thought, if there is ANY possible way to stop this from happening again, knowing that I was very fortunate that my 3-1/2 lb baby was so healthy and I may not be so fortunate the second time around, I had to do it  even though I would never truly know whether or not it helped. At least I would know in my heart that I did everything I could.   I started injections at 16-1/2 weeks, but I think they will start them up until maybe 20 weeks at the latest, if I remember correctly. A shipment of the meds and syringes would be delivered to my house every month or two. A home healthcare nurse from Alere Healthcare would come to my house once a week and administer the injection. It is injected into your hip (really, anywhere along the top of your butt cheek, below your waist). It is a slow injection, so you have to hold still, but that isnt really a big deal. Some women find it more comfortable to stand and bear weight on the opposite foot. Other women, like myself, will choose to lie down on your side while it is injected. If you are leery of needles, I would suggest never looking at them. I made that mistake when I got the first box of syringes. The injection isnt nearly as bad as looking at that needle. It would burn a bit going it. The injection is administered slowly because it is a thick liquid. (In hindsight, the **idea** of getting them every week is worse than actually getting them, in my opinion.)  After the first or second injection, I started getting an on-site allergic reaction to the injection within 2 or so days of receiving it. It looked like the biggest mosquito bite you have ever seen, surrounding the injection site, sometimes 4-6 inches in diameter! It was hard, red, and itched like crazy. The compounding pharmacy that made my injections suspected that I was allergic to the base oil used in making the injection, not the actual synthetic progesterone, since progesterone is a naturally-occurring hormone. After some experimenting, I discovered that taking Benadryl 45 minutes before the injection stopped the allergic reaction. It was a cake-walk after that. Judging from the reactions of the Alere nurse and the compounding pharmacy, I think such allergic reactions are not common  which is good for you.   It wouldnt hurt to mention that hardness again the next time you are seen, just to be on the safe side. With my second baby, tests showed that I was having preterm labor contractions at 24 weeks, when we started preventative testing. A fetal fibronectin test predicted that I would go into preterm labor anytime before 35 weeks.  A vaginal ultrasound showed that my cervical length was pretty short, I was already slightly dilated, and a non-stress test showed that I was already having contractions, even though I wasnt feeling them. When all of these results came in, I was immediately put on strict bedrest until I delivered or until I reached 36 weeks (which was 3 months away!), whichever came first. While I was on bedrest, I had to have weekly ultrasounds and 2 NSTs a week. The NSTs showed some very interesting things regarding my contractions. I started realizing that, even though I didnt think I could feel them at all, sometimes I did feel them but they were not radiating. I had thought it was the baby pushing in one spot. As time went on, they did sometimes radiate a bit, but if I didnt have the monitors on, I could barely feel them, if at all.   Even though I will never know for sure, I do think the injections calmed my uterus, and slowed my contractions. I took the injections on Saturdays. When I did the NSTs on Tuesdays, sometimes I didnt show contractions at all, and if I did, they were often pretty far apart. My NST on Fridays were always another story. I dreaded Fridays.  Several times, I left the doctors office and had to go admit myself at the hospital, having contractions less than 3 minutes apart and having changes in dilation. I was hospitalized 5 or 6 times, and often put on magnesium, which is NOT my friend :-(.   But, in addition to the bed-rest and injections, I was also taking Procardia to try to stop/slow preterm labor contractions. It is actually a heart med, but it is used to treat preterm labor.  In my case, I do not think the injections alone stopped the preterm labor but I do truly believe that the combination of bed-rest, injections, and Procardia (and a few hospitalizations, treated with magnesium) all contributed to keeping my second baby in until 36 weeks. The reason that I do not think that injections alone stopped it from happening is because I hadnt finished the injections when baby was born. I still had one extra one that I was going to do. The day I had my baby was my first day off of bed-rest and Procardia. I was scheduled to take my last injection at 36-1/2 weeks. I delivered at 36 weeks exactly.   This is a bit of info about 17p injections from Alere Healthcare, if you are interested:   [ _US/products-and-services/alere-health-management/women-and-childrens-health/ob-homecare/17p-administration-service/index.jsp]( _US/products-and-services/alere-health-management/women-and-childrens-health/ob-homecare/17p-administration-service/index.jsp )   [ ]( )   I hope this info is helpful to you. If you can think of anything that I didnt mention, feel free to ask :-).   EDIT: I forgot to add - the home health nurse was great! She answered tons of questions for me, anything about pregnancy, and I got to hear baby's heartbeat on doppler everytime she came to give my injection- which was really nice.
TwoXChromosomes X After birth, the uterus usually goes back to about the same size as it was before pregnancy. I think maybe you're thinking of the cervix opening - this is stretched when giving birth, so when fitting and IUD it can make it slightly easier for the doctor (and therefore slightly less painful for the person having it fitted!). However, if the doctor is experienced there is no reason for the procedure to be any more difficult for them.
AskWomen X I have Mirena. I was on the Pill for years, but had to stop taking estrogen for medical reasons. My doctor strongly recommended an IUD. My insurance (which is actually pretty decent) wouldn't cover a dime of it, and I had to save up the $1,000 before getting it.  I'm not going to lie. It was incredibly painful during and after insertion. My doctor was proud of me for not fainting or vomiting. It took a little while for me to get used to it. I cramp worse than I did on the Pill, but my periods are lighter now.  Pros: Haven't had one second of a pregnancy scare since this shit locked my uterus down. My periods are lighter. I don't have to remember to take or insert anything. I lost weight when I went off of the Pill. And it lasts for 5 years.  Cons: Insertion. Initial cost. Cramps are worse. Period didn't cease altogether like I was told. The awkward "So... I've got some tiny strings inside of me..." conversation before sex.
TwoXChromosomes X It's probably late due to stress of being sick.  Unfortunately, the more you stress the later is can be.  (It's a cruel trick our bodies like to play on us.)  To calm your fears go ahead and buy a test from your local store and put your mind at ease.  It's probably going to be negative, but it will help you calm down to see that is.  If it is positive, then, you know early, and be able to have more time to think things through. 
TwoXChromosomes X And get a pap smear and breast exam while you're at it. You know, just to be safe. 
BabyBumps X I get what you were trying to say but not everyone carries weight in the same places. Mine was always belly/boobs and at around 18 weeks, I looked like I was pregnant and wasn't just a big fan of cake. I was right on the border of normal and overweight for my height but I'm also short so there's not a lot of room for anything to go.
BabyBumps X Oh yes, it's starting to get intense now.  I still can't tell what kind of limb I'm feeling, but he's very actively stretching and karate chopping (or perhaps kicking) me all day long.  I haven't gotten any of the painful ones yet, but it's definitely an interesting and different sensation from what I was feeling before (when it was mostly just flutters).  I thought it would creep me out, to be honest, but I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would!
TwoXChromosomes X The article specifically talks about selling the mini pill (progestin only).  &gt;  If you hope your BC will also reduce acne, there will be a specific type for you. If you have blood clotting issues, you might be advised against hormonal contraceptives altogether.  Both of these statements apply to estrogen pills, not the mini pill.  &gt; The pill is a widespread and commonly used form of medication - but it still is medication nonetheless, not candy, and it can be dangerous for some types women, or just plain ineffective if you take it wrongly.  So, uh, I guess you're also not a fan of Plan B being sold OTC?
BabyBumps X Aww I loved all of these pictures! I'm only 6 weeks so there's nothing to see yet. I'm so excited to get a little belly! 
AskWomen X I have a Mirena, but it was covered entirely by my insurance, making the cost of insertion $35 -the copay for the office visit.  I  have not had any trouble of any kind since insertion, and haven't had a period for coming up on 8 years now (3 years through second IUD).   I have nothing but good things to say about this method.  The pain of insertion was no worse for me than my worst cramps and I haven't had any trouble since.
BabyBumps X I've been hearing that I look small a lot, but I'm eating like a trucker:)  At my last doctor's appointment I had only gained half a pound since the month before, but the baby's measurements were all fine. Overall I've gained about 34 pounds and I started at 150 pounds, so I am definitely not a skinny minnie!
BabyBumps X I don't know. It seems to me that there is this kind of... adversarial dialogue going on. I don't think it is necessary. I think that there are merits to many systems, and that which works for and with a woman should be condoned if not promoted. It seems to me that the medicalisation of child birth is problematic, but I am glad that there has been attention given to getting better (medical) outcomes out of those situations that needed it, that would have resulted in a preventable and treatable harm. But for the vast majority of childbirths, with appropriate antenatal care, the medical issues are minimal if nonexistant.
BabyBumps X I actually think we're in the minority here :( There are threads constantly about the irrelevance of classes, birth plans, going med-free, etc. I wish there was a subreddit for natural childbirth or something.    I'm doing Bradley with my husband at a birth center. We're both extremely excited for the birth :) 
BabyBumps X 41 weeks today...last I was checked I was 3cm and 100% effaced, also got a sweep....that was Wednesday. My Doctor got my hopes up because he said he thought I would go naturally this time, but it's been a few days and nothing. I have an induction scheduled for Wednesday, where they plan to break my water in hopes of inducing labor. I was hoping it wouldn't come to that, but it seems like it may at this point. At least it's not drugs, but if contractions don't start I'll have to be pumped full of pitocin. I'm pretty disappointed because I already had to be induced once...I'm starting to think that my body can't go into labor mode naturally.  I'm just SO ready.  Anyway, good luck! I don't have any tricks or anything, and if I did maybe my own baby would be out by now! I do hope you find a way to get that baby out without having to be induced! If I may ask, what are they going to do at the hospital to induce if Monday comes around?
TwoXChromosomes X Sorry to burst your bubble - you can't expect to **completely** eliminate the chance of getting pregnant unless you stop having sex, or have your partner sterilized.    Spermacide is the least effective method, with about **26% of people using it for a year getting pregnant**. About 14% of people using condoms get pregnant during a year of use. About 5% of women who use hormonal birth control pills get pregnant each year. For an IUD the rate drops to 2% of women a year. Male sterilization is actually the closest you can get, as it drops to a .15%  pregnancy rate. Compare this with the fertility rate of doing nothing, which decreases with age.    * 78% - 25 year old, doing nothing (3 in 4 women, or preg in 1.2 yrs on avg) * 63% - 30 year old, doing nothing * 52% - 35 year old, doing nothing * 36% - 40 year old, doing nothing * 26% - typical spermacide use (1 in 4, or preg in 3.8 yrs on avg) * 14% - typical condom use (1 in 7, or preg in 7.1 yrs on avg) * 5% - 45 year old, doing nothing (1 in 20, or preg in 20 yrs on avg) * 5% - typical pill use * 2% - typical IUD use (1 in 50 women, a pregnancy in 50 yrs on avg)  * 1.8% - typical fertility tracking (1 in 55 women) * .5% - typical female sterilization (1 in 200 women) * .15% - typical male sterilization (1 in 600 women)   Knowing about your cycle and being aware of whether you may be able to get pregnant on a certain day is just good sense, even if you're using other forms of birth control. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think using condoms as well as birth control gives me a better advantage than just having sex when I am not fertile. I am not saying my method is 100% but compared to yours it is 98% more effective.   So you can throw all the math in there you want. 
TwoXChromosomes X I know what is going on inside my body, I also know that if you have sex outside of your "fertile stages" you can still get pregnant with unprotected sex. I didn't say your method was Wrong, I said it wasn't for me because I want something more guaranteed.  For your reading pleasure, here is some information (because everyone needs to be educated).  Can a woman get pregnant during her non-ovulating days? - yes, yes she can. [where the info came from] ( _a_woman_get_pregnant_during_her_non-ovulating_days)  Your ovulation days in a perfect world are 12 to 16 days after the first day of your menstrual cycle begins (first day of bleeding) But we are not in a perfect world, and you can ovulate pretty much whenever. So, in answer to your next question, yes, you can get pregnant on non-ovulating days, because it's really hard to even know when you are ovulating. So, the day you start your period is day one. 13 days later, you should be most fertile. Ideally. They sell things at stores that test your fertility. They kind of look like pregnancy tests, and they tell you how fertile you are. I don't know any brand names or anything. You should check into those. They should help.  OPKs (ovulation predictor kits) are made by Clearblue, Answer, and there is usually also a store brand. You may also opt to save a lot of money by ordering them from the Internet.  Its a very slim chance that you could get pregnant sometime after ovulating(non-ovulating days). The egg dies, 1-2 days after ovulation (24- 48 hours). The only time you have a high chance of pregnancy is if you have sex days before ovulaton.  Every woman is different. Some women release 1 egg each month (the normal). Some don't know how many they release, which can become very stressful. I had unprotected sex on an non-ovulating day and i did'NT get pregnant, and talk about being stressed out. Anytime you have sex after ovulating, there's a lesser chance of becoming pregnant. if you have a regular period (28 day cycle each month), you can track ur ovulation days on ur calendar or you can look at an online ovulation calendar. it tells you which days not to have sex and which days to have sex. but if you have an irregular period, it is best that you do not rely on the ovulation calendar. It is not particularly difficult to tell when you are ovulating---the cervical mucus is more abundant, clear, and stringy. Non-fertile day mucus is scanty, cloudy, and tacky. You can tell the difference on toilet paper if you pay attention. You get fertile mucus for a few days before you ovulate, to assist sperm in getting past the cervix and into the womb. If you avoid making love during the fertile mucus times and for three days afterwards, you will not get pregnant. You can have fertile mucus more than once in your cycle. See -ovulating day if it's close enough to ovulation, and you could possibly get pregnant after ovulation has occurred. Sperm can survive several days after intercourse. Thus, if you have sex several days before ovulation the sperm could be up there waiting to fertilize the egg. If you have sex after ovulation occurs, it would probably need to be within 12-24 hours of ovulation in order for you to get pregnant. There is about a one-week window during the typical woman's menstrual cycle when she can become pregnant from intercourse.     Your method is not enough for me, I am sorry if you think I am wrong for not "knowing my body" which I do thank you. (I Had to monitor my fertile days to help me get pregnant with my son because my husband's count is low). But please, don't lecture me on what I should and should not do with my body.
BabyBumps X I don't understand the no birth plan either. While I don't have a "birth plan" per say, I do have specific wishes that my doctor and partner are aware of. I want it to be as natural as possible and I don't want the epidural if I can avoid it. My doctor and my partner know this and everything will be done to respect my wishes. My partner and I have taken classes so we have alternatives to the epidural for pain relief. I'm well informed as well so hopefully everything will go smoothly. That being said, I do trust my doctor to give me the best advise for mine and my baby's health.
TwoXChromosomes X The HPV vaccine. Stops some/all (not sure which) types of genital warts, which cause cervical cancer.
TwoXChromosomes X Ultrasounds after the CVS were complete showed abnormalities, which were not followed up on because of the results of the CVS chromosomes.  That is wrong, and could certainly be seen as negligent.  Prenatal testing should always be confirmed, preferably by another technique - and even moreso in cases where termination is being considered.
TwoXChromosomes X I have a host of medical problems that I would not have known about had I not gone in for a birth control prescription. Had it been available OTC and I'd just grabbed whatever was cheapest, the complications of that could have been dire.  I don't think regulating medication is attempting to control other womens bodies. It *should* be widely, easily available/no cost...but it should *not* be over the counter.
TwoXChromosomes X Getting sick in the morning? Pregnant.  Taking a lot of naps lately? Pregnant.  Peeing a lot? Pregnant.  Don't want to drink tonight? Pregnant.  We can't win.
TwoXChromosomes X I once got a letter saying they found "abnormal cells" and that I had to come back in 6 months to be tested again. When I showed it to my mother she said she'd had the same thing once or twice as well as my aunt. There wasn't anything wrong, they just wanted to monitor it in case it was the beginning of something like HPV. It's not always the end of the world hun, but I know how it feels to have doctors scare the beejeezes out of you like that.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I don't think regulating medication is attempting to control other womens bodies.  You sound exactly like Santorum. You are ridiculous.
TwoXChromosomes X This used to drive me nuts too!  I AM pregnant, and I've thrown up approx. 5 times.  Pre-pregnancy, I threw up from hangovers approx. 113279162931628931297 time.  Moral of the story - hangovers cause way more Cariboumustard barfing than pregnancy, so if I'm barfing, chances are I'm hungover.  But really, HILARIOUS joke.  Super funny.  /Sarcasm.  Gr.  
TwoXChromosomes X I could be wrong, but I think HPV can actually go away. It's a virus, so you'll always have antibodies to that particular strain, but you can clear the virus.
TwoXChromosomes X That isn't denying the fetus progesterone it's denying the environment in which the fetus is in and requires to live progesterone causing that environment to break down which kills the fetus.  If that's not killing them, pulling a feeding tube and tearing a bubble for immuno-compromised individuals isn't either
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure the pelvic exam is a legal requirement, but I've never heard of a doctor giving or renewing the prescription without the pelvic exam.  Where are you?  Here the pelvic exam is recommended yearly, and the PAP as well after the age of 21 or after having more than 5 partners.   And by here I mean the US, so most of the people commenting are probably referring to a different sort of doctor visit than you are.
TwoXChromosomes X Make birth control free and easily accessible. Also, provide actual sexual education (not just abstinence education). Legalize abortion. Reduce unemployment, so less people have welfare babies.
TwoXChromosomes X Good luck! Don't be nervous, it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. When the speculum is inserted, you'll have discomfort but no pain.   PRO TIP: relax your muscles, I have a habit of tensing up and all that does is make everything even more uncomfortable. My first gyno. told me a little trick that always works... push your bum down onto the table/ bed thing, it always seems to make it less uncomfortable for my lady parts. 
BabyBumps X This is my first baby so I'm not sure when I'll go into labour but my baby dropped last week at 33+2. :)  I didn't take any pictures of before and after - I wish I had :(
TwoXChromosomes X I wish my partner was more vocal. The few times he made noise sent me through the roof lol. I'm usually very vocal but I can't make noise just for the fun of it, I have to be experiencing pleasure. Body language is also an important factor in this discussion because many of our movements can be involuntary and literal responses to stimuli, like pleasure.
TwoXChromosomes X Did it ever occur to the lawmakers that even parents that would keep a severely disabled child would like a little warning so they could plan ahead. There are plenty of people that would keep a disabled child (my cousin is one) and knowing the child was going to be born with birth defects gave them time to get things in order, decided where to have the baby, get medical equipment lined up, etc etc. They're taking away all kinds of choices, not just the choice to abort. 
BabyBumps X I was 1cm 50% at 36w. 2cm 80% at 37w (membrane strip). 3cm and 90% at 38w (membrane strip). 4cm and 100% at 39w (membrane strip). Delivered at 39w4d.   After that 36 week check I was really motivated to keep progressing. Walked a mile every night, had "sex" (more like husband making a sperm deposit on my cervix, lol) twice a day. I started labor at 4cm/100% effaced. Labored at home from 10am to 6pm and in the hospital from 7pm to 1am. Pushed for two hours. So, technically I still had a 17 hour labor, but my body knew what it was doing. Everyone is different!!! Good luck!
BabyBumps X with my second I walked around 4cm dilated for over a month.  with my third, I had no dilation at all the night before I went into labor, and my labor was only a few hours before baby was here.  Dilation doesn't mean a thing, and don't let the doctor tell you you won't make it to 40 weeks, this is your first... you will likely make it to 41. That's when most first timers are born.
TwoXChromosomes X it may be your hormones acting funny due to the new birth control, and shark week combined, i would say wait a month for your body to balance it's self out then re think it, it may be clearer then, i hope it all go's well for both of you.
TwoXChromosomes X It's my opinion that if there is no medical reason for the c-section, people should not schedule them.  Quite obviously if a medical need arises, c-sections are fine/wonderful, but I do think that since there are always risks to surgery, people should not plan them without a medical reason.  Personally, if I ever have kids, I'd like to try for a natural birth (minus pain medicine) but of course the issue of pain medicine is a personal choice for each person.  I would prefer to do this because I think it's the best thing for the baby and honestly, I think it is just a really fascinating thing to experience birth without the use of medication.  
TwoXChromosomes X *you do not have any moral ground to claim the need of terminating an independent organism able to sustain itself*  The same can be said for euthanizing animals... and no it's not "okay" because it's different and we are superior.  
TwoXChromosomes X I don't see the point of giving my body medication if I don't need it. Also, yes, it slows down labor, and it can go into a cycle of epidural -&gt; slow down labor -&gt; pictocin -&gt; speed up labor, intense pain -&gt; more epidural drugs -&gt; slow down labor, etc. Then the baby goes into distress, and you end up with a c-section. Yeah, that doesn't happen for everyone, but it can. No point in causing that to happen unless someone really can't handle the pain. Plus, I've heard that an epidural can really effect the baby anyways. Sometimes, they are medically relevant -- I had to have one since my blood pressure was so high, it would only get worse if I had to endure the pain -- but also you're *really* out of it, and it's made me forget parts of my L&amp;D and directly after it. However, it's really every woman's choice, and should be. Some just can't handle it, and you're right, there's no shame in it (although there's personal shame for me, as it's well-known that I'm a supreme wimp, and I wanted to prove I could do it like my mom, except that I probably can't, especially since I ended up having preeclampsia and will very likely develop it again).
BabyBumps X Looks like they are pretty expensive[ new]( ). I went into the store itself and browsed their sale rack and got a pair of $60 white dress pants for $8 (end of season sale) so don't give up! Honestly, there is SUCH a high turn over on mat clothes that second hand is really the way to go if you can handle it. They tend to be in prettttty good shape. I know in our Value Villages down here there are so many cute maternity jeans and skirts. I almost bought a full priced pair of jeans because I figured I just needed ONE, and if I could get that one, then I could make everything else work around it. I am lucky I got them cheap though, and I have two now! One pair is so cute that I am seriously considering keeping wearing it after baby arrives if they fit me!!  I should also mention- lots of Old Navy's do mat clothes!!!
TwoXChromosomes X Ive had abdominal surgery (not baby related) and it's not like the worst pain ever, either. I think I had relatively manageable pain for about 2-3 days, and had trouble doing stairs for about 10 days, and then I was back to normal. I did not take pain medication after I left hospital and it's not like I was suffering...just some discomfort.
TwoXChromosomes X As a pregnant woman, that is the most horrible anti-abortion provision I have heard of. Frankly, the decision not to terminate this pregnancy was a difficult one. America is not supportive of working mothers and I cannot give up my career. If I thought I would not be informed about complications that would turn my circumstances from "hard" to "impossible," I may well have terminated instead.
TwoXChromosomes X I had the same problem before I went on the pill. It was like, oh not only do I have extremely bad cramps for 2 weeks before/during my period, now I have several days of extremely bad cramps during the 3 weeks I should be pain free!
TwoXChromosomes X Who said its less okay to abort for one reason or another? It is legal and between the mother and her doctor. The reason is moot in any case: should the mother not wish to give birth, she does not have to. Im sorry that aborting fetuses with disabilities makes you sad, but all people are equiped with different abilities to cope with things. I am not capable of dealing with a child with disabilies. I have long term health problems and cannot engage in the level of care a disabled child would need. So, i would most likely abort if i knew my child would need that kind of care once born. This isnt a better or worse reason to abort, however.
Parenting X We tried The First Years Breastflow bottles which worked well to reduce spitting up from gas and reflux after feedings.
TwoXChromosomes X I work with Planned Parenthood and the state I live in does not require an ultrasound or the woman to view the ultrasound. Most women that come in for abortion services are very early on in the pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasounds are already very very common because how early most of the pregnancies are. They are taken for medical purposes and if the patient wishes to view the ultrasound they can, but most the time it will just be a little bean blob. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had three kids, without paid medicine. Honestly, it hurt way less than i thought it would. If I found it really unmanageable, I would have asked for an epidural, but it really didn't hurt that bad.
TwoXChromosomes X My uterus was just barely big enough for an IUD and insertion was pretty painful, so they wanted to make sure it was positioned properly before they sent me on my way. While they were there they snapped some photos of my ovaries for future reference. It's been awhile, but I'm pretty sure insurance covered it. 
BabyBumps X LMAO, yep! I've always loved your username. :)   And yeah. Somebody suggested it might have just been a muscle spasm, which I am thinking that is the most likely candidate. It was just really strange, I've never had one in that spot before LOL. But I have felt small movements from the baby, I think, for a week or so now. Kinda fluttering or something, it's strange but pretty cool. I am looking forward to a kick tho...which I am sure I will regret later once the target is my bladder 9_9
BabyBumps X I'm using Paragard. I found that it did make my periods heavier and more painful at first; this effects decreased over time. Now I've had it about a year, and I don't have cramps; my period is still heavier than it used to be, but not crazy heavy.
TwoXChromosomes X If she tested positive, the doc would've given her a little slip of paper confirming it, which is needed for insurance purposes.   Except, you know, she lost it, or they don't do that for ectopic pregnancies, or she gave it to the nurse who didn't give it back. Or something.
BabyBumps X I think I started feeling movement around 17 or 18 weeks, but I wasn't sure. It was driving me crazy. I felt a weird popping sensation, then something that felt almost like tugging. I didn't feel the "fluttering" I'd heard of, so I wasn't sure what was going on. Finally someone on here mentioned that pretty much everything below the belly button was the baby, so it finally clicked I was for real feeling him move! Pretty awesome. Then around 20 weeks, he started really getting into it. My husband felt him move and we could see my stomach pop up a little with each kick. 
TwoXChromosomes X When I'm on the pill (Yasmin) I have barely any flow. I guess I free bleed. I just think of it as saving money on tampons.  Basically when I pee, I just wipe away whatever there is, barely enough to  stain panties. 
TwoXChromosomes X Rape, coerced sex, contraceptive failure all bely your words.  Having an abortion *is* taking responsibility. Having an unwanted kid, not so much.  And women not having sex means men also don't have sex, something the very men shouting 'get some sense of responsibility!' don't seem so keen on.
TwoXChromosomes X Using a Diva Cup is different than using a Softcup.  I would recommend checking out www.menstrualcups.org before you purchase a Diva Cup. There are many different kinds of menstrual cups. They come in different sizes (length and width are both variable), capacities (do you need something for heavy flow, or will a smaller cup suffice?) and stiffness. The size charts that are given by companies typically tell you to choose one size if you have not given birth and another size if you have; this isn't always the most accurate. Check them out. They are a great resource.  The cup typically isn't painful when you put it in or take it out, though if your hymen is still intact that might experience some discomfort. Basically, you fold the cup up tiny and get it past the sensitive opening of your vagina. (I use the 7-fold. There are many folds that you can try. I encourage you to experiment!) When I take it out, the cup is squishy and not stiff, and after I break the seal, I just slide it out slowly.   If you decide a cup isn't a good fit for you right now, you might want to consider cloth pads. These are more breathable than disposables and don't contain the chemicals used in making the disposables.   Good luck!
BabyBumps X Nice. You should def consider taking some childbirth classes if you still feel really unprepared. We took the Bradley classes and I feel like a i took a freaking college class of pregnancy, anatomy, phisiology, nuition, exercise, and birth/labor. I feel so empowered with knowledge that I cant wait to experience birth!
TwoXChromosomes X yes, this was my concern....the softcup has a huge opening and when i squeezed it and tried to insert it, it wouldn't fit. Then when i took it out, it wasn't suction that was painful, it was the rubbing on the sides of my vaginal walls that hurt so much.  I was hoping the Diva Cup was smaller and longer. 
TwoXChromosomes X I wouldn't have a period for 4 or 5 months, and then I'd upredictably bleed pretty heavily for a month. Cramps were terrible as well. Birth control was a miracle. It made my periods 3 or 4 days long, predictable (I still remember is came on Tuesday morning between 10am and noon), as well as light. 
TwoXChromosomes X And that's the point of being pro-choice. We certainly would never force abortion on someone, but we want to make sure that option is there, safely, if someone needs it. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I LOVE IT, except for the more painful cramps. I can't use HBC, so my copper IUD is my best friend. Really.     Insertion is a pain, literally, but much worse things could happen from not having it (like getting pregnant when you don't want to be).
TwoXChromosomes X I mean, in their defense, they probably wouldn't care even if it was still microscopically tiny. Most of them are against abortion because of the *potential* for human life thing that he fetus has, regardless of what stage it's at. 
TwoXChromosomes X i do agree that it's killing a living thing, i just don't think it qualifies as murder, the same as scraping living cells from the inside of my cheek isn't murder. 
TwoXChromosomes X But "this thing" isn't viable.  Mercy killing isn't immoral.  Killing for convenience is.  Second, I reject the notion that "whether or not killing it is murder" is even the relevant matter.  Murder/not murder isn't important; what we're murdering *is*.  If we're killing a human blob, it's like removing an appendix- technically killing life, but not important.  If it looks like a baby, then it's more an independent life form than the appendix, and so it should be protected (unless medically necessary).
BabyBumps X We had always planned on a natural birth, but then Little Boy went 2 weeks and 2 days overdue and we finally agreed to an induction, lest the placenta begin to calcify and separate from the uterus (which was happening, verified when we saw the placenta).  Soooo, rather than laboring at home for as long as possible with various tools and comforts and things, we went in to the hospital at our scheduled time of 4am and began the cervix-balloon-thing to stimulate dilation and effacement, and pitocin to stimulate contractions.  For the longest time it was bearable, but nothing was really happening so they kept turning the pitocin up and up.  Eventually it got to be too much for me to handle.  After 20 hours and still only at 4 cm, I got the epidural and was able to *go to sleep* and wake up at 9cm, ready to push about 30 minutes later.  The pushing went really well, took about half an hour, and Little Boy was a trouper through the entire process (never had lagging heart rate or any signs of distress) and latched on almost immediately after they put him on my chest.  So things went completely differently than what I had wanted and planned for.  But they went fine, great in fact, and for my next I'll know that while I still want to have a good plan and be prepared... que sera, sera!
BabyBumps X You're right- being in the hospital itself increases your chances of being subjected to unnecessary interventions. But in exchange, you are seconds away from surgeons and a NICU and all that good stuff. So it's a trade off.  Having a good doula has been proven to improve birth outcomes for mom and baby, and decrease the need for intervention. A good birth plan has also been proven to affect outcomes positively. A good birth class that really prepares and educates you (hypnobabies, birthing from within) will give you the confidence necessary to say "no thank you".    I gave birth at home. I read birth stories all the time on here that make me very glad I did. If you want a natural birth, you have to fight for it or get lucky. That's all there is to it. They all come out one way or another, though, so don't get too bent out of shape about it. Just commit 100% and do the best you can for you and your baby.
TwoXChromosomes X Because I'm a slut!!!! I started taking it for contraceptive reasons, and stayed for the medical benefits. I did not realize how shitty my quality of life was after before birth control, until I started taking it. So now its mostly for medical reasons...I haven't been having much sex lately, sigh. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is basically my period as of late. I haven't had one since the end of December...but definitely not harboring a life in there. The same thing happened to me last semester, I went three months starting in august without a period, finally went to the doctor and took all kinds of test, pregnancy, thyroid, etc, got my period the next day.   Maybe I should just go to the doctors to hurry it along...
TwoXChromosomes X Not the person you responded to, but I have a copper IUD and I fucking love it. 25$ copay for a device that will keep me baby-free (with a higher efficacy rate than pretty much everything else besides surgical sterilization) for 10 years or however long the copper lasts.  My blood pressure is down due to not having hormones racing through my system three weeks out of the month. My cramps are worse, and my periods heavier, but I was never one for bad periods anyway. I have maybe one every couple months because that's how my body is. (If you opt for the hormonal IUD this won't be as much of a problem, since you'll still have hormones, just a really low dose.)  The procedure to get it inserted is weird and kind of painful, but I'd rather get an IUD inserted than - say - a filling done, even shot up full of novocaine. The IUD process is faster, quicker, and wasn't too painful for me. Enough to make me grit my teeth and impatiently ask the doctor if she could hurry up - nothing more.   Hell, if I had to go through the process to get my IUD every month (instead of waiting in line for a prescription), I'd still go through with it, if I could schedule it whenever. *shrug*  As a sidenote: some women find it *immensely* painful. I just thought I'd add a bit of a happy note to it. I was 23 and nulliparous at time of insertion.
TwoXChromosomes X The reason I was looking into the IUD was because most hormonal birth control isn't an option for me - I was on an estrogen pill last year and I got a blood clot from it (I had literally no other risk factors). So now my options are progestin-only pills or an IUD, or physical methods like diaphragm or condoms, but I would really like something I don't have to think about.
TwoXChromosomes X No. Cervical cancer grows *extremely* slowly, so testing every year is only going to result in catching abnormal cells that would never progress to cancer anyway. They're not saying "don't get tested", they're saying "testing every year has no benefit compared to testing every 3 years".
TwoXChromosomes X The first month is weird. My gyno told me to keep taking the pill for 30 days to avoid the weeks of spotting. Now it's just me and my IUD and I get a 2 day period every three months or so. I don't know when it will show up, but it's pretty light and very infrequent.
BabyBumps X haha! I only laugh out of sympathy... always one of my first signs of pregnancy! Last baby and this one... it happened BEFORE I knew I was preganant! Was one of the things that finally made me go... "Hmmm... maybe I AM pregnant!"
BabyBumps X I think babe still has room to be moving around. So he may be going all around. Earlier this week babe was kick my ribs and this morning the kicks have been low. But from what I read we still have a little time before its worry time. 
TwoXChromosomes X You should be getting checkups yearly, whether from a GP or a gynecologist. It's just the Pap that you don't need as often. Seriously, I've never seen anyone recommend that you go to the doctor less than once a year.
TwoXChromosomes X You're painting with a very broad brush. It is possible to believe that a fetus is a baby and deserves basic human rights without also being against the rights of the mother. 
BabyBumps X My baby was still breech at 32 weeks... have been walking like a maniac ever since and today, at 36 weeks, I found out she'd finally moved! The best thing is to keep active! It worked for me...
TwoXChromosomes X Statistically, *you are very rare*. Not don't exist. I'm glad you got your pap smear and the dysplasia was caught early. The fact is, for the vast majority of young women, any abnormal cells that are seen will disappear on their own, with no need for treatment. The aim of this change is to reduce unnecessary treatment. It actually brings the US in line with many other countries. I'm in the UK, and won't get invited for a pap smear until I'm 25, unless I have any worrying symptoms, and after 25 it will be only be every three years. The [NHS guidelines]( -cervical-screening.html#invited) say that changes in the cervix in young women are noraml and cites a paper that found that screening in young women was less effective at preventing cancer than in older women.  It helped *you*, and that's good. But that doesn't mean it's the best thing for everyone.  I would add here that it is still possible to go for more frequent smears if you wish, except that I imagine with these changes, insurance may not cover more frequent smears :/
BabyBumps X Yes, if you gain the recommended 25-35lbs, only like 7lbs of that is fat gain and it's usually in preparation for breastfeeding. You'll lose about 12-15lbs right after giving birth, though you'll still look about 5-6 months pregnant. Then you'll lose a ton of water weight and be left with those 7lbs of actual, true weight gain. But, if you plan on breastfeeding, that weight will come off with no problem - BF burns about 500 calories a day!
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with you on the kindergartener and teenager issue. I'm willing to go so far as to say a fetus and a baby are in two different stages of development through most of the pregnancy and are therefore different, but I do believe a fetus is a human life. I also believe a woman is a human life. She is just as deserving of rights.   So, here is some news for you. Pro life also does not equal anti woman.
TwoXChromosomes X The definition of "stillbirth" isn't hard and fast, but in general a fetus is considered to be stillborn if the death occurs after 20 weeks gestation. Technically, for a child to be stillborn, it has to have died *prior* to being expelled from the mother's body. A child that is born and survives for a short period of time (even if it's only one or two breaths/heartbeats) is actually a live birth. And a fetal death at fewer than 20 weeks is a miscarriage.  So... yeah. A fetus can be classified as "stillborn" even while it is still in the mother's womb, since it can be determined that it has died and will not spontaneously come back to life upon being born.
BabyBumps X With my first baby, I remember seeing the doctor pulling it out.  That is, I saw him pulling on the cord between my legs, lol.  With my second, the midwife didn't do anything with it immediately, then a little bit later, she encouraged me to push it out while the other midwife pushed a little on my stomach.  A little bit of pain both times, but nothing terrible.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a cup/cloth pad user. :) Tampons and disposable pads give me a horrific rash.
TwoXChromosomes X Yep, he said that most of his experience with IUDs was in women with previous pregnancies and that I would have a higher risk of complications. I know that was BS, but I'm not sure I want to go the IUD route. It would be my best hormonal option since the dosage is localized and much lower. I think it may be too long-term for me.
TwoXChromosomes X My doctor told me that there's no way to prevent the spread, not even condoms, and that it's not one of those STIs you really need to disclose (at least not the strain I have). It is basically a genital flu. If you know it's the non-cancer kind nor the warts kind, then symptom-wise, you should be fine even if you contract it, assuming your immune system is normal (and if it isn't, I have no idea what the increase in risk is, if any)
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on which one you got - Mirena, the one with hormones, will stop periods pretty quickly.  The one without, Paraguard, can actually make them longer/stronger...that's what's happened to me. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth it not to worry about a pill, but the longer periods are a lousy side effect. My doc says it gets better tho (I've had mine for 1 1/2 yrs), and I do know of at least one person who has stopped getting periods completely on a Paraguard, so my fingers are always crossed that this will get better.
TwoXChromosomes X From experience I would say if  you're not currently having sex with someone stop taking the pills for a few days and start a new pack. I had problems birth control was supposed to fix- but didn't. Occasionally I would have a period in the middle of the pack and if I didn't do this it would keep on going  until my period was normally  supposed to end (so 2-3 weeks total). If I stopped taking it until 7 days after the period started, and then started over, I would be fine. 
BabyBumps X I just had a completely drug free home birth. The midwives also showed me the placenta at my request. Seriously fascinating yet totally disturbing at the same time.  But glad they showed me.  Regarding the op, it totally depends on your birth, but not painful really. My first was a forceps baby and managed 3rd stage. I didn't feel it. But was left traumatized. This time it was all natural. No drugs to speed it along etc. It took an hour to come away on its own but had I stood up. It would have just fallen out sooner.  
BabyBumps X That's interesting, but I don't buy it. When I had my VBAC at a hospital I had to sign a wavier form. It clearly stated on there that a VBAC had less risks than a repeat c-section. The ACOG, wouldn't recommend all women have a chance to have a trial of labor for a vbac if they felt vbac's weren't safe. They are a bunch of worry warts! 
BabyBumps X Actually, to a small degree, you can control it. There are 5% more babies born naturally (ie. non c-section) on the days before and after halloween.  So some women are choosing to advance or delay their babies to avoid having one born on halloween (for religious reasons I guess?).   
TwoXChromosomes X And diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, rhythm method (FAM), etc.  But please at least put an other.  [Planned Parenthood]( -topics/birth-control-4211.htm) has a fairly comprehensive list.
TwoXChromosomes X "If you MISS 2 light pink "active" pills in a row in WEEK 1 or WEEK 2, of your pack: 1. Take two pills on the day you remember and two pills the next day. 2. Then take one pill a day until you finish the pack. 3. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the *7 days* after you restart your pills. You MUST use another birth control method (such as condoms or spermicides) as a back-up for those 7 days.    This is word-for-word what is in my Gianvi booklet (Yaz generic).
BabyBumps X My SO just noticed this yesterday as I got out of the bath, while I've been freaking out about it for of a month. I knew they would gte darker but bigger? Didn't expect that. Pregnancy is really no joke when it comes to having to adjust mentally to how your body changes.    
TwoXChromosomes X This may get buried but this is pretty important. Cranberry juice, water, pills and everything are fantastic but I had a serious medical emergency in September.   I had numerous UTI's over the course of a few months in 2011, tried basic antibiotics, cranberry pills and juice as well as garlic (garlic is an anti-inflammatory. Eat it raw for the best benefits).  My pain went away after awhile, no burning, but one night as I was watching movies on my own I noticed an irritating lower back pain. Over the course of just a few hours I was in the worst pain in my life, I couldn't stand, sit, lay down or function in anyway. I was out of my mind in discomfort.   I went into emergency and was seen by four doctors. Top urologists at the Rockyview hospital here in Calgary. My many UTI's were actually different forms of bacteria that, after awhile had become a super bug. My urine was getting trapped and flowing back up into my kidneys which wouldn't have been bad but for the bacteria trapped with it. I was nearly in renal failure and I was on liquid antibiotics with a line in for over four weeks.  So if this is getting BAD, get it treated. I nearly lost the use of my kidneys. Be careful!  Edit: Refraining from sex entirely for a few months and then starting to become active again is better after numerous UTI's. Also, get a good water based lubrication and use it even if you think you don't have to, and don't forget to use it for putting in your tampon.  
AskWomen X Something similar happened to me (I was switching birth control) and my doctor said the best thing to do to avoid screwing up my period or anything like that was to wait for my next period and start the new pack on the Sunday after my period started.  Granted, this was about 6 years ago, and I think things have changed with when you can start a new pack.  Basically, you should start it as if you're starting birth control for the first time again.  Whatever the instructions are for that.
TwoXChromosomes X I misunderstood the title of this survey. I thought it would ask what type of birth control we use or if we use birth control for other medical reasons.   Do you only want answers from people who use birth control to prevent pregnancy? 'Cause I'm a non-heterosexual virgin and I didn't get any questions about birth control, yet I take BC pills to regulate my period.
TwoXChromosomes X The problem is the laws requiring things like this are requiring that US pictures are included in the medical file, requiring it to show specific information about a fetus (such as size). Depending on how far along you are, a regular ultrasound may not be able to take the type of picture required by law. So someone in the very early stages of pregnancy would need the transvaginal ultrasound.   Edit: So while ultrasounds are required, you *usually* aren't required to 1. undergo a transvaginal ultrasound and 2. required to physically look at the ultrasound or hear the heartbeat. 
BabyBumps X Of course they all aren't. I'm sorry that this thread is attracting a lot of generalizations.  I've said ti before and I'll say it again: there are plenty of OBs who are good at following your birth plan and will help you explore none medicated options, as well as ensure a safe and healthy delivery for both you and baby. There are plenty of midwives who have no idea what they are doing. There are plenty of OBs who will rush you in and out of labor due to hospital protocol or policy, or who will even schedule you for early induction for "convenience". And there are plenty of midwives who are helpful, kind and very good at what they do (which is natural child birth). There's plenty in between.  My issue with the blogger is that she only accepts that all midwives are charlatans and all OBs saints. This is not the case. 
TwoXChromosomes X Nope it's not unusual to have irregular periods either due to stress, lifestyle, illness or just naturally as the way you are. Before I was pregnant if everything in my life was on an even keel, no stress, moderate exercise, healthy diet etc my cycle (i.e. time between first day of one period and first day of next) would vary between about 28 and 38 days. If I was under stress, lost weight, went on holiday started doing much more exercise I could skip a period or have one come early or something too. My periods are just irregular, my mum's are too, it's slightly inconvenient not being able to predict it, but it's never been a massive problem and I got pregnant quickly too.  (Irregularity can also be a symptom of problems like PCOS, but I think that tends to be accompanied by other symptoms)
BabyBumps X This is totally what it felt like. This and the goldfish and popcorn descriptions have me convinced that I'm finally feeling the baby moving!!
BabyBumps X I had this thought last night.  I'm 26 weeks today, and I saw my tummy side on in the mirror last night and thought "how the hell can I fit another 14 weeks of growing in there?!"
BabyBumps X I'm almost 17 weeks and I'm not *sure* if I've felt it yet.  I started out as a bigger girl with some extra on my tummy, so maybe it'll take me a little longer... not sure.  But last week, I started to feel what felt like pressure points on my lower abdomen... not painful, but noticeable. Not popcorn popping or goldfish swimming, just pressure. I've also been feeling period-like cramps since day one, but these feelings are different. It actually feels like if a toddler walked up to me, balled up his little fist and gave me a little *boop* on my tummy, but with pressure. It's so hard to explain. If anyone can tell me if that may be it, that'd be awesome.
BabyBumps X This may be what I'm feeling! I commented on the main post because I'm not sure. I'm almost at 17 weeks and I said it feels kinda like if a toddler walked up to my belly, balled up his little fist and gave me a gentle *boop*, but with pressure... no pain, just small pressure points. Could that be my baby? I'm not sure :/
TwoXChromosomes X For the first 2-3 months I was on it, I sort of had my period for 2 weeks straight, then went 2 weeks without it, then 2 weeks with it.  Other than they, the only other side effect I've had was that my boobs went up a cup side.  Now, my periods are very brief (4 days at most), very light, and I have not had cramps at all.  Basically, these hormones have been awesome for me.  Best of luck to you!
TwoXChromosomes X I have the copper iud so it's no hormones but really effective birth control. I had nothing but bad side effects with the pill, but it helped lessen my periods. But beware: my cramps and flow got waaaay worse with it. But hormone free makes it 100% worth 
BabyBumps X Even after having 20 progesterone injections and 4 steroid injections with my last pregnancy, that amnio needle is still intimidating :-/
BabyBumps X It feels like something is lightly tapping on the inside of my lower belly. Sometimes I don't want to attribute it to the baby because it's so light, but I know it definitely is the baby.
TwoXChromosomes X That sounds a lot like me.  I just got my IUD inserted a few weeks ago and had cramping/spotting for the first couple of weeks.  I was expecting the cramping to get worse during my period, but it actually went away and has yet to return.  In fact, the only time that I ever had cramps during my period was due to taking birth control (used to get mild ones when I was on the pill and didn't realize that was what was causing them until I stopped taking it).  
BabyBumps X Also...  After reading how unreliable the blood results are, why bother.  Both my OB and my high risk doctor told me that these tests will soon be a thing of the past because newer, more reliable testing is being developed.
TwoXChromosomes X I had "evidence of prior HPV exposure" on a PAP one year, at the same time I was having odd bleeding during intercourse and some other unpleasant discharge. They sent me for a colposcopy, turned out to be nothing to worry about because by that time my body had fought off the infection on its own. It is good to get tested, but they won't generally biopsy unless there is evidence of early changes to the cervix.
BabyBumps X If it helps, I started feeling better around 10 weeks or so. Actually worried me a little when I suddenly woke up feeling great!  Everything was good though. Hope you feel better soon!
BabyBumps X I didn't get any nausea until 7-8 weeks, lasted till about 13 weeks. never threw up from it though. maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones that never gets it?
BabyBumps X When I was pregnant with my first, aside from some mild nausea if I went to bed on an empty stomach in the morning, I had NO morning sickness. I was really lucky. This time around, I haven't been, and I would kill for that lack of morning sickness. Everyone's body is different. I wouldn't worry too much..quite the contrary! :)
Parenting X My wife and I were there 8 weeks ago (looks like 6 weeks along).  Get ready for a long 7 weeks of tears, random nausea and dizziness, and no libido.    In 7 weeks you'll be loving it though.    tl/dr: 1st trimester sucks; 2nd trimester boobies &gt; awesome. Congrats!
BabyBumps X I had no morning sickness at all, though around 7 weeks the exhaustion hit as my body started building placenta apparently.  I was exhausted for about 4 weeks, back to healthy.  I've also had very few bad symptoms, a bit of heartburn, some random cravings here and there.  It's been really easy so far.  Keep your fingers crossed!
BabyBumps X I joked with my husband that I should have seen this coming since I've always had horrible periods - they last 1.5-2 weeks and I go through 20 of the super pads a day and I have HORRENDOUS cramps. So why should I expect an easy pregnancy? LOL  yes - I am still sick. Most everything is still making me throw up. I hate my co-workers who say, "I was only nauseous for a week and I never threw up." I'm thinking, "I haven't thrown up in 5 years until now - this is not normal for me!"- My doctor's not worried about it, so I guess I'm okay. If I don't eat something in the morning, I get *really* nauseous, which makes  me *not* want to eat, but if I don't, here comes the bile... and puking that stuff up is painful. :(
BabyBumps X I had no morning sickness... until 8 weeks. Then I was nauseous and vomiting until about 34 weeks. Give it time :P
TwoXChromosomes X These have the most comfortable cardboard applicators I've ever used.  The applicator is thin and has a rounded top like plastic ones do.  I can't stand most cheap cardboard applicators that are just a tube with the end of the cotton tampon sticking out- the friction of the cotton end hurts going in.
TwoXChromosomes X I do see the point you are making- personally I believe that for the fetus, since it is not even viable out of the uterus until 20 weeks gestation. I feel that some where between 16 and 20 weeks should be the maximum time limit to terminate pregnancy.
TwoXChromosomes X Shouldn't it only be considered a human being when it can survive on it's own outside of the mother, before that it is just a part of her and nothing more. Shouldn't life truly begin at moment of possibility of actually existing (because before it could not survive in the outside world).
TwoXChromosomes X I have nothing whatsoever against the "promotion of breastfeeding," as you put it. Although it didn't end up working out for me, I fully realize that, all other things being equal, breastfeeding is preferable to bottle feeding.   What I *do* object to is the refusal of all too many breastfeeding advocates to acknowledge that "all other things" are never equal and to the outright *shaming* of any woman who chooses not to breastfeed. A couple of weeks after my daughter was born I had to go back to the hospital to pick up some paperwork; you should have *seen* some of the looks I got from nurses when I told them I didn't end up breastfeeding. And then people wonder why some women's hackles come up every time the subject is mentioned.
TwoXChromosomes X I have never understood this particular argument.   It makes no sense. If fetuses are parasites, then so are babies (yes, yes they are. babies are benefiting at the expense of the parent) and even arguably infants and young children.  And we don't sanction their killing do we?  And even more damning to the argument, fetuses are not parasites by definition. Because a parasite must be of a different species then the host in order to be considered parasitic.    The reason we allow for abortion is the same reason we allow for alcohol (and should allow for drugs). Because people are going to do it anyways, and seeing as how it affects nobody but the person getting the abortion and a* non sentient being, it should be regulated and not outlawed.  Not because fetuses are parasites.  EDIT: forgot an "a"
TwoXChromosomes X Have you tried cotton panty liners? They can feel a bit bulky depending on which ones you get but that should counter the yeast infection problem and would also be more environmentally friendly I know you can find a lot on Etsy.
BabyBumps X When I was not plus size, with my first, I still couldn't feel my uterus, because unless it's contracting, it's not hard. Eventually, however, I could feel my baby. It just felt like my belly was getting bigger... no discernible difference between uterus and non-uterus.  Now, as a plus size mama, I've learned how to locate my uterus through palpitation, but I still can't "feel" it persay.
BabyBumps X No the risk is higher than 1%, especially in a VBA2C, it could be up to almost 4%... which means it's still possible to get by without having it happen... but it's STILL a pretty big risk  You also risk placenta accreta, which would not prevent you from having your VBA2C, but would require surgery afterwards.  Other risks involved include whatever issues may have been present which warranted the first two c-sections, such as a personal history of pre-ecclampsia/ecclampsia.  Now as I said... it's totally possible, yes. I know multiple women who did it. However, I have a friend who had her heart set on it and did NOT prepare herself for the possibility that a c-section would still be necessary, who ended up with a c-section and had a lot of issues coming to terms with the birth not going as it was planned... so as I said, yes, plan for it. Hope for it, but prepare yourself for the possibility that it won't happen, so you don't end up having issues like she did over it. That's all.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;From the point of view of a "pro-lifer", an abortion is a killing, and if this were true, their logic would be perfectly sound, given that a fetus is considered a full human being.  To be fair, a lot of pro-choicers hold this (that abortion is killing) view as well.   Which, if you define "killing" as the forcible cessation of another organisms biological functions, it is.
BabyBumps X Congrats!! They'll probably do a vaginal ultrasound because it's still a bit too early to see anything on the belly one yet (just a heads up).  It was so exciting to see that heartbeat flutter on the screen! I'm only about 2 weeks ahead of you so you must be due at the end of October?  Enjoy your little bean!!
BabyBumps X Probably won't hear it this early...I didn't hear mine until I was 16 weeks, but that's a bit late.  Usually you get to hear it around 12 weeks.
AskWomen X There's a few other options where you don't have to take them every day and you might find they have less side effects for you. You may also look into the copper IUD. No hormones, but just as effective as hormonal BC (slightly better since you can't forget). Your OBGYN should be able to help you sort through options to choose something that works for both you schedule and your sanity. 
BabyBumps X That's crazy!  In Australia you are legally allowed 1 year of unpaid leave AFTER your maternity leave has been completed (that depends on your employer).  I have 28 weeks of maternity leave (at half pay, which starts at 36 weeks), plus I'm then taking 7 weeks of my Annual Leave after that so I don't have to go back until the end of January.  And on top of that, because I work and I meet the criteria, I am entitled to 18 weeks of Paid Parental Leave from the government (that I can take in tandem with my work maternity leave) which is based on the minimum wage (so around $350/week).  I don't know how you ladies in the USA manage - I have been exhausted for weeks and I still have 14 weeks to go!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Removal will kill this "parasite", while removal of any other "parasite" (children, SOs, etc.) will not. That is the difference. End of story.  Ok, so correct me if you are wrong, you are arguing that a fetus is a parasite (in the more common usage of the term as opposed to the biological one) because, once removed, it dies. but because when you remove a baby/child/SO, they will survive.  Right? Well If this is what you are saying, I have two problems with this.  First, the death of the parasite when it is removed from its host has *nothing* to do with the common usage definition [you yourself gave.]( ?s=t)   Second, even if it did, babies and some younger infants would still be considered parasites, because if you remove them from a host, they will die just as surly as the fetus will.  &gt;If you're arguing only the biological definition, which dates from only a few hundred years ago, you are arguing semantics.   I am arguing both definitions. The biological definition does not apply because a parasite must be of a different species then the host, among other reasons.   And the [other]( ?s=t), because then the justification "I can kill my fetus because it is a parasite" must extend  to to all the others who meet this loose definition of a parasite. If that was an real justification for killing, you could use it to kill your month old child. Because children (and alot of different types of people) meet this definition.  I have been saying both definitions are not applicable since my first post, actually.  Another thing is, when someone says "I can kill my fetus because it is a parasite" they are usually referring to the biological definition as apposed to the more common one.
BabyBumps X You're around the average time for the first ultrasound so you're probably right.  Plus it'll be a fun one, the little one will look like a baby, just very tiny.  And you'll be able to see the movement, at my 10 week ultrasound my little one was waving and kicking and jumping around... My nickname for my baby is little jumping bean.   You may want to call ahead and see if there is any way to record your ultrasound.  I was able to bring in a CD-R so I have some pictures and a few video clips that I was able to save onto my computer and show my family.  I view it at least twice a week, haha.
AskWomen X If you'd really only feel comfortable with a hormonal birth control, why not talk to your doctor about a progestogen-only pill?  I had similar issues with the Nuva-ring + i got horrible migraines, so my doctor prescribed me Mirena. I never ended up taking it, deciding to ditch hormones entirely and rely on condoms, but it might be better for you with less effects. 
BabyBumps X I agree with the others that it is probably nothing to worry about. But I do have to say that I was having preterm labor contractions at 24 weeks. So, it is possible, just not that likely.   Do you notice that baby is moving a lot right before the contraction occurs? Just wondering, because I noticed that phenomenon on my non stress tests. Among other issues, I think my baby's movements would irritate my uterus and cause it to contract.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeast don't feed on plain, sugarfree yogurt, and the bacteria acidophilus combats yeast. 
BabyBumps X Yeah, I wouldn't worry unless you get more than 4 in an hour, they increase in frequency and/or intensity, or you have a change in vaginal discharge.  Drink more water than you think you really need and try to change positions (sit, stand, do something different).  I'll share my experience if anyone feels inclined to read it:  A few weeks ago (at 27 weeks), as we were preparing for a vacation, I started having a TON of these painless contractions.  My OB had said before to call if I got more than 4 in an hour, and I felt I was having like 10-12 in an hour.  I tried resting, a warm bath, drinking water, everything I thought would help.....still, these stupid contractions persisted.  I finally called my OB, and of course they asked me to come in.  They hooked me up to a belly monitor and had me press a button every time the baby moved.  Sure enough, they could see my contractions every 6 mins or so.  (So, at least i wasn't imagining it!)  They checked me by hand and did a trans-vaginal ultrasound to see if I was dilated (I wasn't).  They also did a fetal fibronectin test - the test that indicates if you have a chance of going into labor in the next two weeks.  While they waited for the results of the fetal fibronectin they sent me up to L&amp;D to keep me on the monitor and gave me a a liter of fluids via IV.  Long story longer... Test came back negative, and I was cleared to go on vacation as scheduled as long as I came in a couple days before we left to follow up.  They assured me that I did the right thing by coming in, and to watch for any change in discharge or any continued contractions that increase in frequency and intensity.  The nurse quipped that maybe my uterus was just feeling irritable.  :)  I still felt fine and the contractions slowed and finally stopped after the IV fluids.  Follow up visit and vacation went off without a hitch, and since then I've been drinking SO MUCH FREAKING WATER.  A couple contractions here or there... Nothing painful, nothing like that one day.  Now, I try to stay super super hydrated, try not to over exert myself, and sloooow down whenever I feel contraction-y.  TL;DR - my story about calling my OB for lots of Braxton Hicks contractions.  Also, drink way more water than you think you should.    On a side note, for anyone traveling while pregnant: ask your caregiver for a copy of your pregnancy records and keep it with you while you travel.  That way you have it if something happens and you end up needing medical care.  I had never thought to do that until the nurse/midwife mentioned it.
TwoXChromosomes X Whoa, how did you get pregnant with an IUD in?  Highly unlikely!  Get it out ASAP!  Or other wise your baby will start growing around the IUD and end up nothing but a mass of deformed tissue, or will start growing in your Fallopian tube and destroy your reproductive system.
TwoXChromosomes X You need that IUD out NOW. IUD pregnancies have a high chance to be ectopic pregnancies.  I'm 20 weeks pregnant with my condom baby right now. Don't worry about what may happen in the future, worry about what's going to happen now. Get that IUD out, get a transvaginal ultrasound to check where the baby is in your reproductive system, and get yourself on some pre-natal vitamins. 
TwoXChromosomes X I do think there are good rational reason to put forth for legislation of BC/abortion to ensure access, but arguing but that the government shouldn't legislate to restrict because "it has no business legislating" is a flawed argument is all.  I actually agree reproductive care should not be restricted very much, but I do not abide dishonest arguments, especially when honest ones are available. We shouldn't use dishonest arguments just because they are more rhetorically convenient.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, you can still test positive for awhile after a miscarriage. But spotting can be pretty common in a pregnancy. In both my miscarriages, there was no mistaking it for spotting, lots and lots of blood.   Edit: you can't just.. hope for a miscarriage and wait 2 months to go to the doctor. Are you going to keep the baby or? Keep calling gyns until someone gets you in. 
BabyBumps X Mine started at 24 weeks, too; at 35.5 weeks, when there was a full moon, they were coming every 5-7 mins! They were still just "practice contractions" and not causing any real dilation. 
Parenting X Delay the cord clamping. Let the blood flow into your baby until it's done pulsating. This is way better than banking it.
TwoXChromosomes X There is a small window during pregnancy (4.5-6 weeks) where a transvaginal ultrasound might be needed, otherwise transabdominal is just fine (for extra-uterine pregnancies too). Consenting to an elective abortion really should not legally include consenting to a needlessly invasive procedure as well (in most cases, this is what the vaginal ultrasound is). If a non-invasive, equally medically sound alternative exists (in the majority of cases this is the abdominal ultrasound) then it is not ethical to deny a person that alternative because of a political agenda (or any other reason).   Ultimately, the states proposing these laws are proposing a needless (in most cases), coerced penetration of women's bodies in order to further political, social, and religious agendas. The laws don't allow for many (or in some cases any) exceptions and allow for no individual judgement by the attending physician. Framing this issue as rape is certainly uncomfortable, but to me it's becoming less and less sensational. 
BabyBumps X Although I get your rationale, I completely disagree with you in this case. Your thinking is very black and white. Specifically with obstetrics, there is so much unknown.  It is a lot of educated guesswork, which is often based on a doctors past experiences with patients and also on generally accepted practices that are proving to be effective in the real world. The problem is that people do not want researchers to experiment on their pregnancies and their unborn babies. Do you blame them?   HOW do I know? Well, that is a very loaded question. My first pregnancy was completely routine at first. On the day I turned 31 weeks, I started bleeding a little. It was appointment day anyway, so I just waited, figuring it was nothing and would just mention it to the doc. She seemed a bit concerned and checked me. I was 3cm/90% effaced. At the hospital, a non-stress test showed that I was having a lot of contractions, and I wasnt feeling them. They put me on an IV of Magnesium Sulfate, which is a soft tissue muscle relaxer, used to treat preterm labor. The point was to hold off labor as long as possible, with hopefully at least enough time to give me steroid injections 24 hours apart in order to help babys lungs develop. The Mag makes it difficult to get up, but at first, I was allowed to get up. When I got up to use the restroom, my contractions shot back up to over 20/hr. I wasnt allowed to (or even able to) get up after that. They were able to hold me for 6 days without delivering this way. So, in this first instance, it is obvious from the monitors that, when I was moving around, my contractions were increasing, i.e. bed rest to resolve that problem.   With my second pregnancy, I was high risk from the beginning because no one knew what caused the preterm labor.  I started tests at 24 weeks in the hope that we would catch any warning signs. The combination of a vaginal ultrasound that showed my cervical length to be pretty short, an OB check which revealed that I was already starting to dilate and efface, and a fetal fibronectin test that came back positive (which my doctor was using as a predictor for preterm labor-negative results are more definitive than positive results), led my doctor to put me on strict bed rest for the remainder of my pregnancy. The NSTs were showing that I was also contracting at 24 weeks. I started taking Procardia, which is a heart med, used to treat preterm labor. I was hospitalized 5 or 6 times because I was still having contractions, sometimes less than 2 minutes apart, and I did continue to slowly dilate and efface over those 3 months. I had also started taking progesterone injections once a week, starting at 16 weeks, because progesterone calms the uterus. These are the realizations I had:   1.I f I would get up to use the bathroom or take a shower and was up too long (more than  hour), I could feel my uterus start to get irritated and contract.   2.If I went any longer than the 4 hours after taking Procardia to take another dose, I could tell that the contractions were coming back.   3.When I was put on magnesium at the hospital, the monitors proved that it slowed my contractions, and vaginal ultrasounds and OB checks proved that I had stabilized.   4.When I would take weekly progesterone injections on Saturdays, I could tell that by Monday, my uterus had calmed down and I wasnt having as many, if any, contractions. My NSTs on Tuesdays were almost always great, little if any activity. By Thursday, I could feel the irritability coming back. I dreaded my NSTs on Fridays. Almost every time that I had to be hospitalized, it was on a Friday  the day BEFORE my next shot.   5.My FIRST day off of bed rest and Procardia, my contractions started coming back, much stronger than before. I had a precipitous birth, having my 36 week baby at 2pm that very day.   Taking all of these things into account, I am convinced that the bed rest, Procardia, Magnesium Sulfate, and 17p injections DID all work in staving off my preterm labor and delivery. I know you are listing statistics here, but I am simply telling you that there are people out there that are helped by things that are not proven up and down and sideways by studies and experiments. Dont you realize how many meds/practices are used for ailments other than what they were originally intended for  because they work?    Have you ever been through preterm labor and delivery?????? If you have, I would think you would understand that, because at least 50% of preterm deliveries have no known cause, women that are in danger of delivering preterm will do bed rest and progesterone injections with the hope that it will help carry baby to full term  even if bed rest is torturous and you are allergic to the injections, and whether or not you will ever know for sure if it helped? Or do you suggest, because there is not definitive proof in studies done that we should do nothing and let nature takes it course, whether it kills the baby or not? I would rather suffer for the chance of my baby being healthy than do nothing and just wait and see what happens. 
TwoXChromosomes X So will you be back for a follow up pap in a few months or getting the colposcopy right away?  A lot of these clear up on their own.  Try not to panic!
BabyBumps X well, you can explain to her that it'll be easier on your 2nd pregnancy to be relaxed as much as possible. Mention how stressed you were when you had your 1st baby shower and you don't want to go through that again.
TwoXChromosomes X 1) I think crazy periods are normal for a while.  2) I was on birth control for about 5 years before my IUD(s) and thus never had a "normal period" before my Paragard. While I had it I had almost constant (like 95% of the time), but super light spotting for about 9 months, until I switched to Mirena (love!).  3) I had more cramps than normal, but by no means "bad" cramps while I had my Paragard. 4) Yes, cramps got way less intense to the point where I had none.   The chances that it fell out are very, very small, so I wouldn't worry about the strings if you can't feel your cervix. (Only worry if you can feel your cervix, but no strings where they should be). 
TwoXChromosomes X Even if it is irresponsible, do you think pregnancy and babies should be a method of punishment for irresponsibility?
BabyBumps X As far as I was told when my pregnancy puking started with my son "it is not morning sickness because it only happens in the morning. It is morning sickness because it happens in the beginning, of 'morning' of your pregnancy"  That said, I just got done puking, and I'm 24 weeks as of this morning which I figure is well past the morning of my pregnancy even lol. (But I have hyperemesis... So it lasting longer than the first tri isn't a huge surprise, while normal mornin sickness usually let's up by 16-18 weeks.)
BabyBumps X Ugh! early pregnancy can be rough! The best thing you can do is take care of meals and cleaning. I was so exhausted after work and cooking made me more super nauseous, so any help in these areas were awesome.   treat her like you would if she was sick and you were taking care of her. I'd take a bad flu any day over early pregnancy.
BabyBumps X It can really be wrong +/- 2 pounds. They told me I also had a big baby, 8 pounds by 36 weeks and at 40 weeks they said she was 10 pounds. I had her at 40 weeks, 8.6 pounds. I had another friend who was told her baby was 4 1/2 pounds at 39 weeks, so they induced her thinking something was wrong with the baby, he ended up being just a little under 7 pounds. Long story short, don't assume they are right. Ultrasounds are notorious for being off this late in the pregnancy. 7 pounds at 37/8 weeks sounds perfect to me though :)
TwoXChromosomes X I've had my Mirena in since 2009 and in the last few months my breast pain (tenderness is too mild a word) has skyrocketed. I have no idea why either. So, no useful solutions for you, but at least we aren't alone with it.   I do see my OB/GYN next Monday and I am going to mention it because in addition the breast pain, I had two periods in the space of 4 weeks and one of them, though very very light, lasted 10 days. 
TwoXChromosomes X I actually semi-agree. I believe it is within a woman's choice to get an abortion, but I think we should better educate everyone about contraceptives so that we have fewer unplanned pregnancies. I think abstinence-only sex ed is the problem here.
BabyBumps X I'm 23 weeks and haven't purchased anything except clothing for the future. I have winter and summer clothes for next year that cost me next to nothing. Every store I go in I make sure to check the clearance section so I have a variety of sizes. I was able to find a snow suite marked down from $65 to $10 at Sears. 
TwoXChromosomes X Welcome to my world!  When I'm not on birth control, mine are so bad that I am sobbing while in the fetal position for the first 2 days...And that's while medicated. :P I'm sorry, I know that it sucks hardcore.  Why are you not taking BC now?
TwoXChromosomes X I prefer to track on my phone &amp; use the MyDays app. It tracks my menstrual start and stop, ovulation, days of sexual activity and although I don't use them, you can also enter your daily BMT and when you took your BC pill. It also has a list and chart option with an overview and history. The overview is probably one of my favorite features becuase it gives the following information:  Day in Cycle: 23  Approximate Cycle: 31 Days  Next Period: 2012-03-29  Next Ovulation: 2012-04-14  Dates of Highest Fertility: 2012-03-09 through 2012-03-14
TwoXChromosomes X I'm sorry, but a regular PAP exam *isn't medically unnecessary.*   Maybe if more women paid attention to their health and did this, it wouldn't be such a pain point.  But as it is, women routinely avoid having a test that *could* save their fucking life.  Why?  Because it sucks.  It's uncomfortable, it's gross, and nobody likes it.  But as someone who has a family history of female repro cancers, and who has had abnormal cells removed?  The entire idea that regular testing is unnecessary is 100% **bullshit**.  
TwoXChromosomes X The difference is that while we can opt out of colonoscopy, we still need the procedure. However the mandated ultrasound isn't needed for abortions. The abortion ultrasound is entirely superfluous &amp; still unwanted.  Also, ultrasound procedure and anaylsis isn't free. So you admit that the unneeded and unwanted procedure is wasting someone's money.
Parenting X When in doubt, call a lactation consultant! With that being said, it sounds like her milk has just come in, resulting in engorged (read: rock hard, hot, sore) breasts. This is pretty normal and the best way to get rid of it is to keep breastfeeding on demand. As someone else suggested, a warm shower can help relieve some of the pain/pressure.   How do you know she can only get a few drops out? Is she hand expressing milk? Pumping milk? Babies are much more efficient at removing milk than either of these methods. If she is trying to pump, I would recommend she stop right away before her milk supply gets out of control. In the first few weeks, your body is trying to learn how much milk to make. More milk out=more milk produced. At the stage where she is engorged and has too much milk, the last thing you want to do is encourage more milk production by pumping frequently.   How is the baby latching? Do you see a pattern of sucking and swallowing while the baby feeds? Can you hear the baby swallowing? [The Jack Newman website]( ?pagename=videos) has good videos to help you evaluate if your baby is effectively drinking. Also the [Kellymom website](www.kellymom.com) has great information for breastfeeding mothers. If the baby is having trouble latching because of breast engorgement, it can help to hand express some milk before feeding to soften the breast.   Now that mom's milk has come in, the baby should wet at least 6 diapers a day. If the baby is doing all of these things, your baby is probably getting more than enough milk from mom.  
TwoXChromosomes X Ok, but no matter what you want to call it: coercive, state-mandated, medically unnecessary vaginal penetration, with no apparent aim other than to humiliate and cause discomfort, is pretty abhorrent.
BabyBumps X I like your flair- "little what's his name". I noticed you're 32 weeks as well...I'm due May 11th! (and hopefully I make it till closer to that date) after a few hours of monitering and iv fluids I was still having contractions (they were getting a little stronger) so they have me a shot of something that starts with a "t" to make them stop, which thankfully they did.
TwoXChromosomes X The ultrasound is to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. how far along you are determines what kind of abortion you can get.   The reason it is in the news is because woman are being forced to get an invasive type of ultrasound that they might not have consented to if given a choice and are being forced to see the ultrasound of the fetus before the abortion. In my state (Oregon) you have the choice to hear the heartbeat and view the ultrasound if you want to but you don't have to (I personally opted out). It's already a difficult and personal decision, the laws being proposed and enacted are just making it even more difficult and are being used to try and shame women. 
BabyBumps X My son was measuring 5.5 pounds and he was born at 7 pounds 1 oz, 2 days later!
TwoXChromosomes X At least you weren't wearing period stained granny panties with a menstrual pad bulging out.
TwoXChromosomes X No, no they do the ultrasound and you have to see it.   There are two types of ultrasounds. One that's just done on the stomach and another that is called transvaginal, meaning an ultrasound wand is inserted into the woman's vagina and they do the ultrasound that way. The laws require transvaginal ultrasounds, which are invasive and can be traumatic. 
BabyBumps X I have a friend who has a "bicornate" uterus, meaning it was normal but had a septum come down in the center. All it really meant for her was that the baby might have some growth issues depending on where it attached, but everything went swimmingly for her first pregnancy and so far in her second (she's like 27 weeks).  Don't sweat it until you talk to a doc about it! It's probably fine.
BabyBumps X Huh, let's see... I haven't really thought about this, so I'm going to flesh it all out.  I had one at 8 weeks to date the pregnancy and confirm initial viability. Then, we opted-in to the California Prenatal Screening Program which consisted of an ultrasound at 12 weeks and another at 18 weeks. I had another at 22 weeks when I went to L&amp;D for some abdominal pain. Another was done at 32 weeks to check on the placenta since some initial blood work showed a certain hormone was low. Then I had one at 34 weeks when I went into L&amp;D for cramping. A growth scan was done at 36 weeks. Then I started having to do twice weekly NSTs an have had an AFI ultrasound at each of those so far for a total of 3 more.  That makes 3 as a matter of standard practice for my doctor (dating, anatomy, and growth scan), 1 for the genetic screening we opted-in for, and 6 more as a result of the need for closer monitoring.   10 total.   Gosh, I didn't realize it had been so many...
BabyBumps X I had one at 8.5 weeks to confirm viability and date. I'll have another at 12 for the Nuchal Translucency, then my OB schedules the gender scan at 16 weeks, but that seems early to me. The anatomy scan at 20 weeks and one more at 34 to check for growth. The practice into to also sees high-risk patients (which I am not) so I think for scheduling purposes, they keep everyone on the same U/S routine. 
TwoXChromosomes X So they're actually campaigning against the ready subscription of drugs like Viagra and suggesting that non-medical action be tried as an alternative?
BabyBumps X I plan on being overdue starting August 29 through mid-September.  And I'm always ready to evict the thing any way possible starting weeks before my EDD.  That last month is PURE TORTURE I tell you!
BabyBumps X I started feeling kicks around 16 weeks but I'm pretty small. I have a plus sized friend and she started feeling them at 26-8 weeks. 
BabyBumps X I had one at 8 weeks to determine age and confirm pregnancy (best Valentines Day present ever!), the nuchal translucency scan at 14 weeks (where we found out we were having a boy), the anatomy scan at 19 weeks, and an additional scan in the ER at 23 weeks to make sure baby was ok (I was experiencing chest pains and irregular heart beats).  So, I had four total, but I would have only had two if we had not done the nuchal scan and if I hadn't gone to the ER.  I switched midwives (we moved) and the standard at the new office was just one ultrasound at 20 weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X I had a few more (perhaps 15, in total but only 9 were really needed per cycle) but I had mostly day pads. I had 2 light ones, and 4 (maybe 5) overnight, with the rest being day pads. But it's also fair to note that my cycle was light to medium, and not heavy.
BabyBumps X I'm at 38 weeks now, and while it's exhausting to incubate an at-term baby, I think I might miss being pregnant when it's over. This is the last time that I'll know exactly where my baby is at all times. When she's out in the world, I'm sure I'll be worrying a lot. 
BabyBumps X At my practice 2 is the standard. The early risk assessment/NT scan at 12ish weeks and the anatomy scan around 18 weeks. This pregnancy I also had one at 8 weeks because it was too early to ge the heartbeat on the doppler at my next appointment and my doctor was nice and wanted me to not worry.  Last pregnancy I had at extra one around 30 weeks because I was going to be travelling and they wanted to be sure a marginal placenta previa had cleared. I think I had another one a bit later when I was having some strange pain or something. And then one at 40 weeks as part of the non-stress test.
BabyBumps X If the round ligament pains are actually pain in upper right quadrant (i.e. liver area), then it could be very serious.  Spots and headaches are definitely possible symptoms of high blood pressure and possible pre-e and should be checked out as soon as is possible.
BabyBumps X I've been saying boy since the beginning of the pregnancy, but I started leaning toward girl after we couldn't see anything at the 20 week ultrasound.  My mother-in-law actually cried when we told her...she has two sons and one grandson, so she's very excited!  
BabyBumps X They say ultrasounds are terribly accurate in the first trimester because fetuses grow at the same rate during this time and have very distinct features that develop rapidly from week to week.  Based on my last period, I was 11 weeks pregnant, I went in for a dating ultrasound and the fetus was only 9 weeks.  Not all women, in fact most women don't ovulate at exactly 14 days from the time of their last period, which is the basis of "pregnancy weeks."  Due dates are estimations, there is pretty much a month long window during which most women deliver.
TwoXChromosomes X This is just the second one. Before this one I was also having very heavy and long periods. They are shorter and lighter with the new one, but the cramps are still bad. I think I'm going to have to see the doctor to discuss other options. 
BabyBumps X I got morning sickness with my daughter too the last trimester. It was terrible! (I thought I was done with it after week 10). I would eat and it would come right back up. Try to do the same things that helped you on earlier in pregnancy. Almost at the end! Stay strong :)
TwoXChromosomes X Well you have a couple of options. I suppose you could always stop the pill and try another form of non-hormonal contraception for a couple of months to see if that has any benefit on stabilising your mood. If you feel that this isn't possible then perhaps discuss with your doctor about trying a different type of pill, as many of them have a slightly different ratio of hormones that could  have a slightly different effect.   Overall, I would say discuss your concerns with your doctor. 
AskWomen X Have you tried an IUD? There's the copper one (non-hormonal) and the Mirena IUD (very low amount of hormones that's concentrated). I have the Mirena myself and it's a huge difference! I didn't get the copper one as it gives you a heavier flow, but the Mirena has such a low amount of hormones, it works out well. 
AskWomen X It was already incredibly clear from the first post that they really wanted to keep this baby, but felt they couldn't. There are a lot of people who think they are in no position to raise a child, but find that they have undiscovered strengths and resources when they get put before the actual choice.  It is a lot easier to be talked out of something you didn't really want to do in the first place and all the reasons they put in place - although entirely rational and valid - for an abortion were maybe well thought out, but not in the same realm as this decision they now made.  It may well be a bad decision, but at least now they have made a decision that they can both feel truly at peace with, whatever may come.
BabyBumps X It's a self-hypnosis program.  I think they do classes and stuff but I just downloaded the torrent.  There are like 5 mp3 tracks, my wife has only used the sleep one so far, the others are for visualizing your baby's birth and breastfeeding and post-pregnancy.  We tried Hypno-Birthing as well, which I believe is the original pregnancy hypnosis.  I read the book and we listened to the cd that came with it, but I find the Hypnobabies program to be more effective.  Supposedly if you do these programs you can train yourself to relax and experience an easier delivery without drugs.  My wife is trying to go natural so we are going to try anything.
TwoXChromosomes X From what I've heard, Yaz is different from other types of pills. Like, it has different hormones, I think, so maybe you would need a low hormone pill or something?   Of course, some women just don't react well to hormonal birth control. Sadface. 
TwoXChromosomes X Two options come to mind: the mini pill, which involves no estrogen and therefore has far fewer side effects, and an IUD.  Talk to your doc.  Best of luck.
BabyBumps X I really like the idea of visiting in the hospital now JUST because of what you brought up with the nurses being there like bodyguards and visiting hours... if I waited until we were home, they would probably never leave and it would be much harder (or come out more brutal) for me to ask them to lay off. I'm definitely going this direction, THANK YOU!
TwoXChromosomes X I wish one existed. I take the regular one-a-day women's, and they're gigantic. I had trouble getting them down at first but I'm used to it now. I found it very helpful to take them it in the morning, after I've eaten something, with a LOT of water. I'm also not sold on their usefulness, but as my doctor pointed out, they're in the "can't hurt/might help" category and cheap enough that it doesn't matter.   Have you considered chewable vitamins? I can't stand the taste, but that seems like a good way to get past the horse pill issue. They make adult chewables for sure, and even ones specifically for women (that would have the right amounts of iron and folic acid and whatnot). 
TwoXChromosomes X Theres an OTC Monistat anti-itch cream, that might help. Or a mild hydrocortisone cream. Sorry, I've totally bern there, it sucks.
BabyBumps X My husband refused to have sex with me for a few days after our 20 week scan because we found out the baby was Vertex and his head was right against the cervix.  I finally got him to open up about it and he said he didn't feel right poking our son in the head.  He looked at me and asked "What if I leave a dent?" 
TwoXChromosomes X Try getting a vibrator and having as many orgasms as you can in one session. I never experienced a high sex-drive while I was on depo for two years, but actually had a decreased one. I also experienced no change in appetite.  Maybe talk to your doctor about these symptoms.
BabyBumps X Man I wish I had some. Tonight getting to sleep was so hard because I thought I was going to vomit at any minute. But I was also so tired. Cure: have a baby. That's the only thing I've come up with thus far. Hahha. I'm sorry. I hope you feel better. Just know you aren't alone. 
TwoXChromosomes X upvote for AZO. That stuff is a lifesaver.  Especially when your doctors appointment is 3 days away. No sense in just biting back the pain, and you can get it at any drugstore.
TwoXChromosomes X I love my Mirena! I need the hormones (my periods are too awful to not have them) and I don't have a ton of cramping and my periods are lighter. I really love not having to worry about taking a pill every day!
TwoXChromosomes X Count me in as another happy Mirena user.  I'm on my 2nd one, 5th year of use.  No side effects, no cramps, no periods!
TwoXChromosomes X I've been on it for about a year and my god am I happy that I'm on it. I used to have the WORST periods in the world, holy crap. Crying, cramping, heavy flow, the works. That's why I started on it. Now my periods come every three months (obviously), and I have very little cramping and the flow has been drastically reduced. I'm not even that emotional. I've become a lot happier now that I'm on it because I'm not all upset from my PMSing. The only side effect I had was that in the third month of the first pack, I had some period-level spotting a couple weeks in, but I haven't had any problems since. The only ting I don't like about it is that I don't have that reassurance that I'm not pregnant every month, but the benefits far outweigh that, and I could just take a pregnancy test every month if it was really that much of a problem. So basically, in my experience, totally worth it. I say give it a try :)
BabyBumps X Its a bartholin cyst.  I checked it out before and it looked completely scabbed over.  Will have to check it out again later.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had my Paragard for over 2 years now and could not be happier with it.  Insertion was a bitch I won't lie, but well worth it considering the little sucker works for 10 years.  Plus, there's no hormones to interfere with eating and weight gain, libido or potential health risks.  The whole having previously given birth thing is a myth.  It's totally possible to have it inserted and for it to stay in place if even if you've never had children.  It also comes out easily and you can be fertile again within a cycle or two.  Honestly, I can not say enough good things about the IUD.  It's an amazing little device.
TwoXChromosomes X I really really want the copper IUD, but when I went to the doctor she told me I was too young (?!) and put me on the pill. I'm 22.
BabyBumps X I loved your story, I am going to be having my baby naturally as well. Knowing that someone else could have a completely natural birth made me feel confident. Did you work out during your pregnancy, what kind of birthing classes did you take? 
Parenting X My wife took our son to Japan at 5 months and he refused to nurse.  She only packed a small quantity of milk for bottles and she didn't even have a manual pump. It was a noisy and painful flight for her.  So: Bring bottles and a pump.  And if stuff starts getting crazy... relax. It seems that stress can affect your ability (and you child's ability) to nurse effectively.  The flight back was a total breeze.
BabyBumps X For me, my first sign was lack of symptoms. I always get breast tenderness approx 10 days before my period starts, I didn't. I was also extremely tired, although I wrote it off as working retail at Christmas. I took a test 3 days before my period was due because I was going crazy wondering since we were ttc.  It was positive. :). I didn't get morning sickness, breast tenderness or food aversions until a couple of weeks later. Good luck to you!
BabyBumps X As long as you're peeing a decent amount each time you pee, it's likely due to the hormones/baby starting to push on your bladder.  If you're only peeing a little each time after you go, you may have an infection (about the only symptom I get of a UTI is the constant urge to pee) 
TwoXChromosomes X why don't you try super tampons?   I absolutely despise overnight pads so I pop one in before I go to sleep and remove it in the morning and it works really well.
TwoXChromosomes X I get BV a few times a year, never with any pain. I had one ovarian cyst, also no pain but it didn't rupture. Sorry this might nit be a ton of help, but just trying to answer your questions! Good for you going to your doctor,  best wishes to you.
TwoXChromosomes X Sending good thoughts your way! I had a hysterectomy for Endo when I was 34.  Best thing I ever did!  Took two more Laps in the next 6 years to loosen some adhesions, and hike up the ol'bladder, but the relief from the pain gave me my life back!  Hang in there, and take good care of yourself!
TwoXChromosomes X That gross jelly-like sticky mucus that happens just before a period that's nowhere close to being "normal" every day discharge; yeah, no one ever told me about that one.
BabyBumps X Boob juice, ha ha, I like that one :)   Hope you feel better! Getting sick while pregnant SUCKS and totally should be against the laws of nature or something. A couple of weeks ago I caught a cold and felt terrible for about 5 days. Then I felt completely better. Then my husband got sick with what I assumed was the cold I had, but this past week I've been sick AGAIN so I think he had something else and passed it on to me. It's so not fair lol. 
BabyBumps X Well, after my son was born I went to get my bloodwork checked.  I had low thyroid as well, doctor said it could be pregnancy related and may work itself out six months afterwards.  So I go on medication and get checked again 3 months later, my numbers are better and since I'm pregnant again and it was such a low dose to begin with to stop taking the medication and just get checked again in another 3 months, which was fine because my midwives suggested getting it checked every trimester just to keep an eye on things.  So yes, pregnancy can fuck with your thyroid, however every woman I've talked to has said that after pregnancy fucked with their thyroid they've been on medication ever since, lol.
BabyBumps X I feel the same way, i'm 39 weeks, have lots to get done and can't find the motivation to do anything. :( I'm just tired, yucky and...drained. 
BabyBumps X Why does she think she is high risk?  If she's made it 3 months without knowing then it's probably a stubborn/resilient fetus.  Plus leaving 1st trimester reduces the risk of miscarriage.  But regardless, she needs to see a doctor, especially if she thinks she's high-risk. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm having my baby in Germany and am so grateful when I read about some women's experiences in the U.S. I see an OBGYN for prenatal care, which is very thorough, but I'm never pressured to do anything I don't want and she takes a lot of time to explain everything and answer questions. I'll give birth in a hospital (although I could choose a birthing center or home birth) with a midwife, but with a full medical team on hand should I need it.  Lots of American women seem to feel like they have to defend themselves against unwanted intervention. This sounds so scary to me, I'm not a Doctor, I'd much rather just be able to trust the recommendations of the experts.
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds like she may have had the plain copper IUD that didn't have any added hormones. I've heard that they can have those side effects.  It's good to know though, so thank you :)
BabyBumps X I've known lots of women that needed another scan after that 20 week anatomy scan because they couldn't get a good image of one piece of anatomy, be it the heart or the spine or what-have-you from the way the baby was positioned or because of the equipment being used or whatever. my anatomy scan was at nearly 21 weeks and it took over and hour because this little girl wouldn't cooperate and get her face out of my bladder! I was practically doing acrobatics on the table trying to get her to turn. finally got an okay profile and a decent face-shot at the very last second while I was balanced on my right side with the tech jamming the ultrasound wand so low into my pubic bone she knows me intimately. at that moment this baby turned her stubborn little face up for like two second before burying it again, the shy little thing. otherwise I would have had to have another scan too. I hope everything is alright with your little one, and that another bumper here can give you some more reassurance! good luck!
BabyBumps X I had to get a second scan with my first daughter because the images of her kidneys looked odd. Her kidneys were, and still are, fine... Just if baby is not in the right position or is too wiggly, it can cause issues getting good enough photos for the doctors own comfort that everything is fine.
BabyBumps X I just learned my baby is in the downward position at my appointment today.  Not sure if that means dropped?  I'm 30 weeks and a few days. So excited. Doctor said it was good. They start to worry if by 31 weeks they are not downward.  
BabyBumps X I had to do two u/s for my twins, one anatomical and then 3 weeks later the echo scan. At the anatomical, they could see the hearts, they just couldn't see the valves as well as they wanted to. My anatomical was also something like 45 minutes to an hour, granted they were looking at two babies, but by the end of it I was clearly uncomfortable and was happy to come back in to finish up with the echo. Sonographer's know what they're looking for, if they aren't comfortable in what they can see or can't see they have to choose accordingly, for some of us that means a second u/s. I didn't worry about it! 
BabyBumps X Don't worry! I had my anatomy scan a few weeks ago and they asked me to come back in for another scan, even though I was there for half an hour being scanned! They said they just couldn't get a good profile, which wasn't a huge concern, but because they have to be thorough (I heard this as "we don't want you to sue us") they asked me to come in again. Happens all the time! If everything else checked out normal, you're fine, baby is fine, they're just covering their asses =]
TwoXChromosomes X Hey, that's a great article! Thank you! I am still a bit confused though because it says to skip the 4th week or your "inactive" week. My pack only has 2 inactive pills, so would I still have to skip the entire 4th week and start a new pack anyway, or should I take 5 pills from the 4th week and only start a new pack once I get to the 2 inactive pills?    Also, I asked my doctor what pills I could use to give me less periods (Yaz, Seasonale, etc), and this is what he gave me. 
TwoXChromosomes X Thanks! My BC brand is Lo Loestrin Fe.  It is just confusing because there are 3 different colored pills and I'm not sure where to start a new pack. I have 24 blue active pills, followed by two white active pills and two brown reminder pills. I don't know why I have two different colored pills that are both active, so I'm not sure if it is the white active pills or the brown reminder pills that are supposed to 'start my period.'
TwoXChromosomes X One thing to keep in mind is that some insurances only allow you to refill your prescription every 28 days, or up to 13 times per year (52wks/4wks), meaning that if you're skipping placebo pills (which is generally fine to do), you may end up paying out of pocket several months.  Luckily, you can usually get around this by having your doctor prescribe it in the manner that you'll be taking it.
BabyBumps X all the time!!! Every time I sit up I think "please go waters!" or when baby is banging his head against my foof I think "just a bit harder baby and you will break it!". I LOVE being pregnant but at the same time I am at the end now and want it over with!   I bet in a months time I will miss it though! xx
BabyBumps X I constantly imagined the dramatic water break in a public place! But alas, it was already broken when I woke up the morning I was in labor. I wasn't even sure it was my water, I was in that "I thought I peed myself" category until it was leaking at a pretty quick clip and contractions started soon thereafter.   For this one, I don't know what's going to happen! I hope labor starts on its own like last time, that's all I really want :)
BabyBumps X My best friend is 5'4" and delivered her first baby vaginally last month. He was 10lb 2oz and 21" long. I know another woman who is about 5'1" and had to have a C-section for her 6lb baby. It all depends on your pelvis, the position of the baby, and what you and your midwife/OB are comfortable with during labor. Try not to worry too much ahead of time. Educate yourself about your options and labor techniques to help you in your goal of avoiding a C-section unless necessary. 
TwoXChromosomes X That's actually a very accurate description of the changes that happen to vaginal coloring over time! Definitely normal.  It's probably due to hormonal changes, either as a result of the pregnancy or because you weren't quite as done growing as you thought you were. But don't worry, you're fine.
TwoXChromosomes X Would they have caught that in a regular pap smear? If so, it's not that. If not, maybe. I'm going to look up other symptoms.
BabyBumps X Hopefully i can pop this baby out on a friday that way i'll have a weekend and those 3 days. I was still in the hospital 3 days after my first delivery i cant imagine my first day in my actual house alone. Im freaking myself out thinking about it. Just over analyzing i guess.
BabyBumps X my husband is going to try to take ~4 weeks off for FMLA leave once I have this baby, which is his employer's version of any kind of medical leave including maternity or paternity leave, and they count a child being born, regardless of if you're the father or the mother, as qualifying for FMLA. he isn't sure if he'll actually get the time off, but he is going to try. he has to use his own leave time, but he has gobs of sick time saved from working there almost 7 years, and a few weeks won't even eat up half of it. he just wishes he could take more, but he is pretty sure he's pushing it trying to take that much. I am so happy he is doing it though! my employer has similar FMLA policies, and I am going to take my full 12 weeks allowed. this is our first kid, and I just can't imagine trying to do it alone after just a few days! I have NO CLUE what I'm doing!! haha.
TwoXChromosomes X Parasite: An organism that lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host's expense.  Depending on your definition of "host's expense", sounds like it fits to me.
BabyBumps X I don't think there's a set answer to that type of question. For some people 22 is too young, for some it's the perfect time. I'm 19 (20 a few months after baby gets here) and in a really solid place and although it's unexpected, I'm in a good place to have a baby. My boyfriend (going to be 22) and I are both extremely ready. However, I know people my age...and yours...that are having children who really probably shouldn't be. Then again, there are also 35-year-olds having children who STILL aren't ready.  Financially and lifestyle-wise you seem more than capable. As long as you and your fiance are both ready, why not? You know what you can handle, so go by that.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm pro-choice, but this argument could be *easily* turned back on you.  "You didn't get the choice to become attached to him, he made that decision. The baby didn't get the choice to become attached to you, you made that decision. He doesn't have the right to terminate your life, and you don't have the right to terminate the baby's."
TwoXChromosomes X I came to post exactly this analogy and wish I could give you more upvotes for it.  The idea of legislating for potential life over actual life is reprehensible.  One moral reason to be pro-choice is because the woman's life always tips the scales when it comes to the potential for life found in her fetus.  So, OP, the answer to: &gt;So, I'm asking y'all: assuming you're pro-choice, how do you reconcile the fact that, objectively, abortion terminates something with the potential for life?  is... I am alive.  The fetus growing inside me has the potential to eventually be fully and sustainably alive.  But you don't legislate in favor of potential, you legislate in favor of the life.
BabyBumps X I was induced last month and didn't get an epidural! I cheated, though, and did take the IV pain meds, the first time for myself, and the second time because my blood pressure was getting high and the nurse suggested it. It's a rough road, but you can make it through the pain, even if it doesn't seem like it at the time! Good luck!!
TwoXChromosomes X I hope I have a similar experience to yours! I'm super paranoid that my body will react badly to it, but I'm hoping that it will just mostly go back to the way it was before I got on HBC, which was long but light periods with (barely) manageable cramping for the first few days. Obviously I would love for it to go the way yours did--lighter!--but even just going back to how it used to be wouldn't be too bad.  I'm excited and anxious all at once about this, haha.
TwoXChromosomes X Really, about the ring hormone levels? It's one of the lowest-hormone forms available.  But for a safe and easy and complication-free backup, honestly, withdrawal. It's about as effective as condoms, statistically speaking, and *more* effective than sponges or cervical caps or female condoms; I can get you the Guttmacher stats if you want, I'm just a little lazy right now. But, the condom is there as a backup in case there's any loss of control. Precum only has viable sperm in it if the guy has already ejaculated since the last time he peed, so if it breaks before he comes you're still fine, so long as you're not marathoning a bunch of times in a row. If by some freak chance it breaks AND he's come inside you, then the morning after pill is the next best bet. But a lot of guys are better at control than they think they are, especially with a condom on already.  Plus, then you get the fun of watching him come on you, or ending with a blowjob.
BabyBumps X Usually with the SCH that I was talking about.. nothing really "triggers" them, they happen randomly. It would be what professor-hot-tits said hers was, a clot under the placenta. also a "bit of liquid under the placenta" or "a dark spot under the placenta" or "a threatened miscarriage" that doesn't miscarry. It really does happen a lot!
BabyBumps X I bled the entirety of my first trimester and about half way through the second. I'm very small (19 inch waist when I conceived) and they told me it was under uterus bleeding from the stretching the baby was causing. The blood was always bright red and very light with no pain or anything. My doctor told me that some women are just like that.
BabyBumps X Plus side: No cervical change means nothing. At all. I had none at all the night before I went into labor with my third. But walked around considerably dilated for over a month with my second.  And not feeling baby's head is likely because baby is not engaged yet. Also means nothing other than doctor cant feel baby's head from the inside, not necessarily a sign of baby being breech at all.  Good luck :)
TwoXChromosomes X The metaphor of the liver-failure patient is similar to a pregnancy in that in both cases, a person's life is dependent upon their physical connection to a woman. Thus, the OP assumes that the situations are the same and that because one situation (the liver patient metaphor) is outrageous, the other must be as well (equivalence).  However, the situations are not the same, obviously, and so that makes the equivalence false. I think the most important difference is that the liver patient is an adult human living outside of the body of the woman. She doesn't have to carry him around, but she does have to accompany him as he does things that normal adults do, like eat, sleep, use the bathroom, bathe, etc. There's a whole lack of privacy thing involved that's a non-issue with a baby in the womb. It's a terrible metaphor anyway. I'm fairly sure that dialysis isn't used for liver failure.  While we're on the subject of fallacies...lovemyfakeboobs is guilty of appeal to authority.
TwoXChromosomes X I had an abnormal pap a few months ago - I went to another gyno and did some kind of -scopy thing where they biopsied the places where the abnormal cells were. The results came back fine.  You're not guaranteed to have HPV or anything like that until the tests come back positive, and even then the body can usually get rid of it on its own.   As for telling the person, just have him over for coffee or something and tell him what's up - if he *does* end up being an HPV carrier, he needs to know so he can take precautions in the future. 
TwoXChromosomes X It doesn't even mean you have abnormal cells.  It could mean the pap stick they used was defective, or that you just had a funky pH that day, or any number of things.   I've had at least 5 abnormal in my life, and only *one* turned into anything - which wasn't even a big deal.  Once, I had a bad sinus infection, and my results came back abnormal because there were weird antibodies in my sample or something.  At this point, if I get an abnormal result, I just shrug and go for another test.  Chances are, I'm fine.   If your results come back abnormal, they typically retest, and if that's still weird, they do a scope (which doesn't hurt unless they do a biopsy, and even then, it's just a cramp).  HPV isn't the end of the world, either - most of the time it fixes itself, and you don't even know you have it unless it shows up on a test.    Don't panic!  =)  
TwoXChromosomes X the fact is that a vast, VAST majority of abortions are not convenience/de-facto birth control abortions, they're the result of rapes &amp; birth control failures. and, as i always say when this subject comes up, if you think it's irresponsible for someone to use abortion as their primary means of birth control, how responsible do you think that person would be in gestating and raising a child? isn't it better that someone that irresponsible *doesn't* have children?
BabyBumps X I'm the same! Pretty much have to force myself to eat. I didn't experience morning sickness or much nausea, I just have no desire to eat most days. So, no pregnancy cravings yet.
BabyBumps X I'm new to this and I love it. I was just saying to my husband I probably look like a weirdo sitting around staring at my belly, but I love seeing the little bumps and bulges the baby makes up in there. I see movement mostly up around my belly button.
BabyBumps X Take however long you want to just be a brand new family. If you want to let people know when you are in labor, you can make it clear ahead of time that the first 24 hours (or however long you want) are for you, baby, and your SO ONLY. Use the nurses to protect your family time...they are good at keeping pushy people out when parents want to bond with their babies. 
TwoXChromosomes X Because you're sliding the actual cotton tampon up, not a plastic/cardboard applicator, it starts to absorb as it goes. I find them just as unmessy as applicator tampons, possibly moreso.
BabyBumps X Calling in sick because of the pregnancy? Not once. Mostly due to lucking out and not having any serious morning sickness - just mild nausea once or twice. Also, I'm a VP in a male-dominated company - so I'll sack up and put up with more discomfort than I would have had I not been pregnant.  Calling in sick due to the pregnancy exacerbating something else? 3 business days - the longest I've ever been gone in my 11 year career. Got the worst triple strep/sinus/laryngitis infection of my life in the first tri, and wasn't allowed to take anything strong enough to really alleviate the misery. And yes. I felt guilty about it. Bah.
TwoXChromosomes X Firstly - I hope you don't try and douche your vagina, although you think you're helping this will really effect the friendly bacteria in your vagina!  Secondly - I recently had a rash of yeast infections and general discomfort downstairs and I finally noticed that it happened after I had sex with my boyfriend after he's showered at the gym. I buy vagina happy shower gel for us at home, but at the gym he'd been using a cheap mint shower gel (not vagina friendly!). As soon as I asked him to stop using it, no more problems! Perhaps this could be something you ask your SO?  Also - if you don't feel your doctor is taking you seriously, go to another one! This is obviously affecting you and you shouldn't have to live with it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Did you miss any pills at all? It could be breakthrough bleeding. Speak to your doctor if you're concerned.
TwoXChromosomes X I really.... don't like tampons. I feel like this view is very uncommon though, especially for girls who don't think tampons hurt or feel gross. It mostly stems from the fact that i bleed far too heavy for even the super-est of tampons to work for more than 2 hours without spotting all over my panties. That becomes a huge problem at night obviously. So i just wear the super wide/long nighttime pads. they last all day, and i just don't have to think about it until i get home. i dont know what you're talking about with tight clothes honestly :/ i wear super tight clothes no matter what, and no one can tell. i also don't see how a tampon is any easier to carry in a purse than a pad... there's like one inch difference, how tiny is your purse???? also i hate having to reach on up there and grab that bloody string and flop it out, and then there's nothing to wrap it up in but toilet-paper and its all over your hands like a tween boy who cut himself shaving. i like the impermeable plastic liner pads have. roll em up, no bloody fingers. 
Parenting X This is really interesting to me. My son was 6 weeks early - about 48 hours outside the window for pre-birth steroids - and didn't have any respiratory events in the NICU. But now he has pretty severe asthma, and has been hospitalized multiple times, and I wonder if the two are related. 
BabyBumps X omg you look so toned! Since this is my second pregnancy, I look about 10 weeks more pregnant, and I've barely gained any weight. 
TwoXChromosomes X It helps the parents be prepared for what they face in the future.  For some people, it's "I'm going to have an abortion because I cannot provide for a special needs child" for others it's "Man, we really need to get our financial shit together because this child is going to need a lot of specialized care".  And if you know which condition it is, you can figure out what kind of specialized care you're going to need to give your child the best life possible.  Preparation is important when you're potentially bringing a child into the world.
TwoXChromosomes X There are drugs that you can take if the fetus is Rh+ and you're Rh-, for instance, that prevent damage being done to the fetus.   Additionally, there are drugs for conditions like PKU that are given to a mom with the condition to prevent damage to the fetus.   If the fetus has suspected Congenital Adrenal hyperplasia, medication can be given to the mom and fetus to prevent symptoms later in life.  [Here's a good summary of diagnosis and treatments that can happen in utero]( -overview#aw2aab6b7) 
BabyBumps X It also helps that I'm on baby #4 this time so I'm very stretched out... plus I lost 40 pounds between last pregnancy and this one, so it's more obviously pregnant and not just fat.
TwoXChromosomes X I've tried these twice. They jsut don't work for me. :( maybe for light days - but seriously - on heavy days the whole 12 hour thing is not true. And you can't really change / empty it at work.
BabyBumps X This morning, my husband told me my boobs look small compared to my belly. I am a 38G. #FML
TwoXChromosomes X That story doesn't make sense to me.  RhoGam is routinely given to mothers with Rh-negative blood type.  They don't wait for indications that the fetus is actually at risk.  They did an amniocentesis to find out if RhoGam was needed?  Why would anyone do that?  Taking RhoGam (even if it turned out you didn't need it) would be less risky to mother and baby than amniocentesis.
TwoXChromosomes X I used to use applicators because I had a hard time reaching far enough to make the tampon comfortable.  Now I just use a cup, so it's not that I (and many other women) am that grossed out by putting my fingers in my bloody vagina.  It's more that it's easier for me to use tampons with applicators because I can put them in further and they don't feel like they're falling out/hurt because they're too low down.
TwoXChromosomes X I hate wearing tampons, but I think the "anti-feminist" bit is illogical. I don't understand that at all. It's just a tampon.  Pads for me, without a doubt. I've never felt like I was wearing a diaper or that it was a dirty thing.
TwoXChromosomes X Look at implants! I've been on implanon for almost 2 years and it's great. No periods! During the first year, I got some wacko pregnancy symptoms, but that's the worst. It never seems to affect my libido either. I also love it because I can touch my arm and know it's there. Also, I suffer from daily migraines, and have felt like my medication for them has worked better since being on implanon. 
TwoXChromosomes X I can say that insertion hurt, but I've had menstrual cramps that hurt worse AND that all three of my tattoos hurt worse. I had on-and-off cramping for the rest of the day, and a couple of times it peaked, but it was never so bad that I couldn't talk through it or anything. I, too, have the Paragard.
BabyBumps X It gets better! The first trimester you're all cravings, nausea, and naps, but your energy will come back in a few weeks and the nausea should fade.  Now, end game pregnancy starts to suck again, but at that point it's less discouraging because it's almost over.  So hang in there!
TwoXChromosomes X I had one very persistent yeast infection about a year ago, and the OTC meds were either too weak to completely cure it, or so strong that they actually burned when applying. I recommend taking one CanesOral pill, and then follow up with another CanesOral pill 7 days later. That was the only way I managed to get rid of my yeast infection. I tried literally everything. YMMV, but if you find it keeps coming back, give this a try.
BabyBumps X What you are feeling is normal. The first trimester can really suck and the symptoms can feel like you are depressed. I have had this with all 3 of my kids and the one I lost. Thankfully the rest of my pregnancy is pleasant even the last tri. I keep myself limber. Just try to think that this discomfort will be over in 7 more weeks. Just take it easy on yourself. You can do this. You are already doing so great!
BabyBumps X Pregnancy has not been anything like what I expected it would be. In my head, I thought once you hit around month 7 things would be tough. You would be tired, you would be uncomfortable and you would be so ready. I truly never expected to feel as crappy as I did before anyone could even tell I was expecting!  I was tired, like SO tired.  I was nauseous every waking minute of every single day til around 10 weeks. Just because I liked a food today does not mean I will like it tomorrow. I worried about everything.  I was terrified I had made a bad decision despite ttc.   I am only 18 weeks now but things are so much better. I still have crazy food aversions but am better at getting around them and I better understand my triggers. I am still really scared and still worry but now that is interspersed with excitement. I am tired but not as overwhelmingly, bone crushingly tired as I was at first. And the nausea is pretty much gone, unless I smell cooking meat, then gag!!  I feel mentally so much better. I'm 2 weeks away from halfway and time has passed so quickly!  Although I'm still not convinced that being pregnant is all that much fun, it's gonna be fine!  Good luck to you!
BabyBumps X Yeah, any signs and we will head home. Midwife told us last appt that first timers tend to go slowly, so that's one of the reasons I'm okay with going.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Although it's really not recommended, with some birth control pills you can start your next pack at the end of your current one and skip your period.  What do you mean? I've read and been told at PP that I could do this with any pill and it's completely safe, it just tends to work best with monophasic pills.
TwoXChromosomes X Not to be rude, but I think the "cluster of cells" argument is a pretty lame one.  You know what else is a cluster of cells?  Me, you, and every other human on this planet.  I think the real issue here is about whether we legally grant personhood to fetuses.  I'm pro-choice, but I think the pro-choice movement could be making much stronger arguments than "that's just a clump of cells."  Because technically every living thing IS a clump of cells.
BabyBumps X I've waffled about this. Our birth choices are written in our chart with our midwives, and we have discussed each option with them pretty thoroughly with them. Our doula has been there for two full "birth plan" options are written them all down. I've asked her to send me that list, hehe.  Psychologically, I didn't want to make a bunch of transfer/hospital plans. That's 100% against my character, usually I plan everything.
TwoXChromosomes X Ah, okay. Well I think they're both about an inch in diameter, but they're also very squishy. It doesn't feel like much. I took [pictures]( ) for you! It looks like the small size is 1.5" in diameter and 2" long (without the stem). As I said, it's very squishy. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'll just push it a bit out of the applicator to check, and then pull it back in before insertion *Shrugs*  Still sticking with Playtex Sport.
BabyBumps X For UTIs, they test me every time because they said that symptoms of a UTI during pregnancy can be very different from when you're not pregnant--so you may not have the painful urination you would normally have with a UTI. 
TwoXChromosomes X If female circumcision were truly equivalent to male circumcision in America--if the procedure were safely performed and did not significantly impact the child's later life--then it would then be morally equivalent. It would still be unethical, as the child has no say in whether or not it is performed, but it would then cease to be a matter of sexual control and would not be comparable to surgeries in which a person's entire sexual future is severely negatively impacted.
TwoXChromosomes X This, and an ectopic pregnancy is fatal for both mom and baby.  OP had no choice. (I'm sure the doc explained this, but it's worth reiterating.)  
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure why you would add the detail about ejaculating but not peeing afterword....you mentioned it twice no less.  Anytime there's penetration with no condom, there's a chance, whether or not you pee. Unless i'm totally missing what you're getting at.  Anyway, the chances sound really, really, slim. I suppose if you need reassurance, get a pregnancy test? And stock up on some condoms so this doesn't happen again.
BabyBumps X Well, I don't know how it happened but 2 weeks after our oops incident I missed my period and peed on a stick with a positive result. It is very slim that conception occured before that. We were safe every time. I didn't think it was possible either. 
BabyBumps X I felt like I was coming down with the flu during implantation for #1. It went after a day though. With this one I had a sore throat for 2 days around implantation. I know it was implantation because I had a temperature dip and I ended up pregnant. My actual morning sickness switched on like a light (from nothing to nausea) at 6 weeks with #1 and 5 weeks with #2.  Edit: I should also say I've had nausea on non-pregnant months caused by hormones, though usually a day before my period starts. Not that bad, just a bit of ick feeling.
TwoXChromosomes X It's certainly not necessary to get a trans-vaginal ultrasound to verify the age of the fetus.  They've been doing abortions forever without putting women through such invasive exams, and there is absolutely no medical reason to start requiring them now.  
BabyBumps X This is my first &amp; he's really unexpected &amp; I feel the same way. I feel like such a horrible person when I lie through my teeth when people ask me if I'm excited. I'm okay with the idea, it's happening &amp; it'll turn out alright, but am I excited or happy? No. Someone please tell me the maternal instinct kicks in at some point...
TwoXChromosomes X I would get on the pill. Before I started taking it, I too was really worried about side effects (gaining weight mainly), but luckily I got on one that eliminated my cramps and made periods easy to deal with. Exercise also really helps, but if you can't get out of bed because of the pain you're in, then I really suggest going to your doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X You definitely should. They can do an ultrasound to investigate for things like endometriosis and uterine fibroids that can cause this sort of pain.
TwoXChromosomes X I dealt with this same thing for years.  I got my period at 11 (26 now) and even ended up in the ER once because I was so incredibly sick from my period.  Think stomach flu + horrible period pain that was literally crippling.  They gave me super awesome pain killers and lots of fluids.  Been checked for lots of stuff trying to figure out what it is (for me it appears to just be a terrible twist of genetics as my mother had the same horrible periods).  The ONLY thing that has worked for me is progesterone only pills.  They don't have the same side effects as regular birth control pills.  Downside is that you do have to deal with spotting which can sometimes not be a huge deal and last a day or two all the way to heavier spotting for a week or so.  Up side is no regular periods and I haven't had the horrible terrible pain/illness that I used to get each month.  I have been taking them for almost a year and a half now and I don't plan on stopping until I'm ready to start a family.  But do make sure there isn't another problem going on first.  Like others have said, there are several conditions that can cause this level of pain.
BabyBumps X Mine went with me to hear the heartbeat for the first time and will be going to my ultrasound on Monday....  19 weeks....where we hope to find out the gender. I don't expect he will do anymore appointments unless there is something wrong. The Dr got a total family history from him when he came to hear the heartbeat so I expect they will be happy to see him. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had the copper IUD for about a year now.  Things I love:  * Don't have to remember to take a pill.  * My boyfriend and I both tested clean, so don't have to use condoms.  * No hormones!  So my sex drive is up, my craziness is down, I'm not having frequent yeast infections (one side effect certain BCs gave me), etc.  Things I do not love:  * Painful insertion (or rather, the uterine sound before the insertion), but the pain really only lasted for about a day after it was inserted.  * Heavy, crampy periods.  Some of this may be my age - even before insertion, I noticed that my cramps were getting noticeably worse as I got older.  But the amount of blood is totally unusual for me, even when I wasn't on BC at all - we're talking a full, 7-day period with extremely heavy flow for at least 3 of those days.  I've never bled this much in my life.  For me, the positives outweigh the negatives, at least for now.  I've heard the Mirena has much lighter periods.  I've heard the hormones are at much lower levels than with traditional BC, but I don't think I've talked to anyone who previously had the sort of extreme reactions to hormones that you and I have experienced (because anyone with those seems to go straight for the non-hormonal option).
BabyBumps X Yeah, I just re-read your post (again, preggo-brain!) and realized you said you were due for it a few days ago.  Haven't had one of those in a while, so I kinda forgot how they work.  xD  If you've always been very regular, it could very well be because you're stressing yourself out over this.  I mean, there is a chance you could be pregnant, but I think it's very very slim at this point.  Like I said, I would trust a pregnancy test last.  I actually haven't known anyone to get that many false positives, but I do have one friend who got THIRTEEN false negatives over the span of like 2 weeks.  Those things are definitely faulty a lot, have you tried different brands?  You should have tried yesterday and split that giant jackpot!  It's back down to non-epic (well, for the lottery) amounts now.
TwoXChromosomes X Some forms of FGM 'simply' prick the clitoris, or remove the clitoral hood. The latter is analogous to circumcision, but both are still classified under FGM, and are the most common forms (85% of those who experience it get these forms IIRC)  That are both genital mutilation of children who had no choice in the matter, are in most cases irreversible, and has led to the death of some infants. They are backed by religion and became popular through attempts to curb sexuality.  Are you sure they are *completely* different issues?
TwoXChromosomes X This was not the new part of any bill.  Trans-vaginal ultrasounds are standard practice for abortions, as a 'normal' ultrasound doesn't often detect the tiny fetus.  The new, controversial part of the bill was the make-her-stare-at-it part.
AskWomen X Guy here:  it can take a long time to get in sync with a partner. Here's my advice: tell her you want to come together. Ask here what you can do to help. Ask her why she can only come during foreplay and not durning sex. Ask her if there's a different way you can have sex that gives here more stimulation.   What worked for me: ask her to be on top and give herself an orgasm. You're a flat surface she can masturbate against. You then observe, feel how she pushes against you, what angles she uses. Work those in when you are on top. After a couple months you'll get her to come on your own power. And you'll both feel great about it because you worked together on it.   Open communication is hard in the bedroom, especially when you were raised in a Catholic bubble (raises hand), but makes a huge difference. 
BabyBumps X Oh and he went feeling around for my uterus, found it, and got *super* excited! "I can feel it," he says, "it's right there! That's my baby in there!" 
BabyBumps X Sounds like you have hyperemesis. I've had it twice. Medication didn't fix it either time (zofran helped enough to keep down water and maybe one meal but otherwise both times it was so severe I couldn't eat or keep food down), first time was 5 weeks til 16 weeks of constant sickness before backing off and not being as terrible, however I had to go in for an iv a couple times because I couldn't even keep water down.  This time, it started at about 3 weeks, then wasn't so bad by 18 though I still get sick at nearly 26. I didn't need ivs this time though, as I could at least keep down water. Two pregnancies between these two? Nowhere near as bad, totally manageable and stopped early (makes me think maybe its a boy again, first was boy, other two were girls)  Personally, the most frustrating thing was people trying to tell me their "cures"... I'm sorry but if zofran doesn't help, crackers certainly wont!  As for when it will let up... It could possibly last the whole pregnancy (thats what I'm expecting again) or it could totally disappear by tomorrow, seriously.. its totally possible to just wake up one day with it gone. Take it one day at a time, keep up the hope that it is almost over... But prepare for it not to be.
Parenting X Seriously, this was 11 days ago. I don't care where you give birth.    All I know for sure is what I personally experienced with the births of both of my children and for both, natural births in hospital using every natural birth technique known to man, I was glad to be in hospital and that was the safest place for us. I personally would not risk a home birth because it can take too long for an ambulance when things go wrong and I would not want to risk my baby's life in case I was one of the unlucky ones.   If a study makes you feel better about your choices, believe the study.     
Parenting X definitely had girls in my class with large boobs by 4th grade, as well as girls who started their period before we got "the talk" at school which was also in 4th grade (20 years ago fwiw). I would have guessed that age 11 was the average instead of age 10 though - but with age 10 still being well within the standard deviation. 
BabyBumps X Yup. Similarly, i'm just telling people I'm due in July. So if they ask me on July 25th why I haven't had the baby yet, I can simply answer "It's still July. I'm only due this month, not overdue" (despite that my actual due date would have me at 42 weeks that day)
BabyBumps X I am 12 wks but I SWEAR I think I felt the baby move @ walmart last week. Is it unheard of to feel movement at 11 wks? It wasnt gas or anything like that, it was DIFFERENT than anything Ive felt before, sort of like fluttery popcorn (?) down in my belly. At the time I was like 'woah what was that, couldnt have been that but the what hell was it?!' I described it exactly like that to my husband and just from my pregnancy readings that is how people explain it, Am I crazy? lol
BabyBumps X Are you alone? Heck no.  Are you offending anyone because the kicks hurt? Heck no.  I haven't personally been there to the extent you are, but plenty of my friends have. Kicks to the ribs, feeling bruised, for some, that's a sad part of the baby's movements.  I DID feel bruised by my son, later on, however. He insisted on sticking his butt out on my right side. It seriously felt like I was bruised there from him sticking it out so much.  So don't suck it up and lie. When someone asks you how you feel, outright tell them "I feel like I'm gestating the Incredible Hulk"  You may be surprised at just how much sympathy you get!
TwoXChromosomes X What do you mean you don't "cum"? Do you mean in a way comparable to a male orgasm with ejaculation? Women don't ejaculate when they orgasm. Well, some women do, you can check out squirting porn if you want. But that isn't the norm, the fluid isn't the same.   I've had at least hundred billion orgasms and never ejaculated. 
BabyBumps X I feel exactly the same way - seriously.  I love feeling her move, and her precious little feet and bum are so cute, but stop putting them in my ribs!  I'm starting to get freaked that she's never going to turn head-down and stay that way - she likes to flip over and over all day long, stretch her legs as far as they will go, and then punch me in the cervix.  Then she rounds it all off by having hiccups right on top of my bladder.   
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, if your partner has an STI, it is likely easier to transmit if his semen is coming into contact with broken skin.  This is especially true in the case of blood-borne illnesses.    If your partner doesn't have an STI. . .well. . .it might sting a little.
TwoXChromosomes X HIV and hepatitis are the major one that come to mind. A google search says syphilis and chlamydia are also blood borne, but I'd double check that info. It's important to know blood-borne diseases can be transmitted in other ways (ie though semen coming in contact with a mucous membrane).
TwoXChromosomes X Menorrhagia here. I can soak overnight pads in four hours. More coverage is better for pads.  Isn't it risky for tampons, though?
BabyBumps X GET THE EPIDURAL! I thought I didn't need it because I was doing just fine on the intravenous pain meds.  But a lot of girls told me that I would regret it if I didn't get it.  I'm so glad I got it! The labor can easily be handled with IV pain meds.  But when it comes to actually pushing it out... oh my god, it hurt soooo bad even with the epidural.
TwoXChromosomes X This is my point. I see the ultrasound as a punishment. I can't comprehend any medical reason for this. So exactly who and what are they punishing? The bills I have read, seems like it's all women who try to obtain an abortion. I only mentioned specific different circumstances because people I know who are strongly pro-life say that it may be ok if the woman is getting an abortion due to incest, but it's not if it's a contraception malfunction. And what I'm trying to say is that either way, it's a cruel pointless procedure.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm too lazy to check through the comments to see if it's already been said, but I might grab a box of tampons with applicators. Some women really don't like the applicator-free style, which can be difficult to use if you have tiny hands and can be uncomfortable to use if you're weirded out by getting menstrual blood on your hand or you change your tampon very frequently (because the dry insertion scrapes and chafes in a way that wet tampons being removed and smooth and sleek applicators don't). I'd get a variety pack (multiple absorbencies). I might also get some wingless pads and some panty liners (some women like them under their tampons because they can catch drips if you misestimate time or absorbency and bleed through your tampon but don't feel like you're wearing a diaper). Really the fact that you've gotten anything is wonderful, though!
BabyBumps X I know how you feel!!!! My son thought my bladder was a bouncy castle! He also enjoyed tickling my kidneys. Now he just kicks my stomach and punches my cervix. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's not potentially viable, it's PRIOR to viability, i.e prior to 21 weeks (some states legally define it as 24). After that it is considered a still birth. Prior to viability does not mean has the capacity to become viable, it means prior to the ability to sustain life autonomous of it's mother.  A blighted ovum has no potential viability, yet it is considered a spontaneous abortion. Same goes with molar pregnancies. Both are absolutely and totally non viable, and they are still considered abortion.
BabyBumps X indeed old blood. Have you had sex lately? exercised too much? strong bowel movement? internal exam?
BabyBumps X As someone who is regularly getting kicked in the kidneys (at least it feels that way) I can tell you, not more fun for mommy. :-) Not only does it hurt like hell, but it makes you have to pee anyways! Maybe baby should kick your stomach or intestines? There's a lot of intestines to aim for!
TwoXChromosomes X In the future, a pretty safe bet to cover all the tampon bases is to pick up a multi-pack box of plastic applicator tampons.  Brand doesn't matter so much, but many women find plastic applicators more comfortable than cardboard, and the multi-pack will have a variety of absorbencies for all occasions.  You will be able to tell they are plastic because it will either say on the box or have a photo that is noticeably different from the cardboard applicators.  Also, you rock for this!
TwoXChromosomes X I took the original depo shot for a year and I had the worst side effects. Acne x infinity Gained 20 pounds Mean to everyone decreased sex drive.   It was the worst. for me.  But I didn't have a period at all...or after i stopped taking it sooo.
BabyBumps X the tea should not make you go into labor, it's for toning your uterus to make labor easier. I have been drinking it the whole pregnancy.  EPO is to "ripen" your cervix. You do not take the oil... not sure if you're aware of that. You use them as a suppository... vaginally...  did it work for me? not really, it was still a few weeks before my daughter was born. Babies come when they're ready.   Why does your doctor insist on inducing you when you're barely past 40 weeks?
TwoXChromosomes X Hey, be careful with wine in cast iron. Acid corrodes cast iron pans.
BabyBumps X I loved reusable pads. I have started leaking, so I've ordered a packet of organic cotton ones.  
BabyBumps X I actually was having a lot of pregnancy dreams before I knew I was pregnant (I was about 4 weeks at the time). I mean, probably every night for a week. I would wake up and think about how silly the dreams were but not once did I think "oh yeah, my period is late." I think my subconscious was trying to tell me, "HEY! FEATHERMAY! GET YOUR ASS TO THE STORE AND GET A PREGNANCY TEST, YOU IDIOT!" but I wasn't listening. I had an unprotected encounter with my husband but I took Plan B so I figured I was fine. Well, the Plan B didn't work because I had actually conceived about 2 weeks prior to that encounter--while I was on Nuvaring. W.T.F.
TwoXChromosomes X Not trying to discredit you, but this is a bit naive. Just because you assume it's clean and it looks clean doesn't mean the thousands of microscopic bacteria flora from your colon aren't still on your skin even after you 'wiped' after your last bowel movement.  So then by wiping back to front again, without having showered in between or anything, you could very well be pushing any remaining anal bacteria on the surrounding skin into your urethra. Aka, a UTI (urinary tract infection).
TwoXChromosomes X So, you don't consider fertilized "cell(s)" in a pregnant women's womb a form of life?
Parenting X This picture is so sweet :-). I'm so glad they are both doing well now. That had to be a horrifying experience for all of you :-(. Was your daughter born at 28 weeks gestation? My son was born at 31w 6d, 3.5 lbs. The pic of your daughter reminds me of how small he was when he was born.
TwoXChromosomes X I have both kinds of orgasms, but my g-spot/vaginal orgasms are way more intense.  I don't really buy that they are the same thing because they feel so different.  I feel clitoral orgasms only where they are produced, but g-spot orgasms I feel all over my body.
TwoXChromosomes X I use P tracker, and I have an android. It tracks ovulation, and you can keep track of different symptoms and stuff as well. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;when the fetus attains a soul, depending on your view  I forget where I was reading this, but there was a Christian stating that life cannot begin at conception, because until a certain point there is a possibility the fertilized egg will split into twins.  Therefore, a soul could not be present until after the point when twinning was no longer possible.  EDIT: wikipedia says twinning can occur between day 1 and 15, so basically, you have twins or don't have twins before you know you're pregnant.
BabyBumps X Don't worry. It does go away- eventually. I myself lost something like 14 lbs between my first vomit at 7 weeks and my 12 week appointment. That's a lot for a pregnant lady.   I hit my peak around 12/13 weeks and they gave me 24 hours to hydrate up or I was going to be admitted to the hospital. It sucked a big fat one. I had to alternate zofran and phenegran suppositories. After a day or two of the combo I had a reaction that caused me to feel itchy/fuzzy ad hallucinate.   I started getting better around week 14/15 and by 18 felt decent most of the time. I had my last flair up around 20/21 weeks. After that it was smooth sailing for this vomit queen.   It sucks so much, I know. If you can get the dissolvable zofran, do, I found it much more helpful than the pill version.   Hugs.  
BabyBumps X Don't cry. Remember... dilation doesn't mean a THING! Seriously!  I was not dilated at ALL last baby, 11pm at night when I checked (yes... I check myself...)   I woke up at around 4-5am in labor and had her at 4 in the afternoon.  Do NOT let those numbers discourage you. Heck, it's possible it could go backwards (seriously) and even THAT doesn't mean anything!
BabyBumps X I had it with my second prenancy. My midwife just had me do a rinse with hibicleanse every 6? Hrs starting when my water broke which was before labor started.  Seventeen hours later my daughter was born and didnt have any issues.
TwoXChromosomes X Please don't go into a vasectomy thinking that it will be reversible. In a lot of cases it isn't. if you think that you might want kids later, wait it out or freeze some sperm. It can really destroy people when they find out that they are, in fact, infertile after wanting the procedure "reversed".
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; may had vomited the pill for that day.  This is probably what happened. A pill that has been vomited counts as missing a pill and can throw EVERYTHING off kilter, especially when you consider the fact that that pill is gone FOREVER. So unless she had a back up pack to compensate with, or didn't take her placebo pills, there were plenty of chances for her to ovulate.  I used to take my pill with a shot or a mixed drink once or a glass of wine once in awhile. Never had a problem.
TwoXChromosomes X What is your current pill? I take a low-dose third generation pill (0.15mg desogestrel and 0.02mg ethinylestradiol). It didn't decrease my sex drive at all. In fact, the only side effect I've experienced was boob soreness.
AskWomen X I know how FAM works, but the rhythm method (regular cycle, last week unprotected) hasn't failed us so far.  Don't take this as a recommendation, though - we've never tried to conceive, so for all I know we might be infertile.
BabyBumps X Mine doesn't kick so much as squirm and stretch a lot.  Unfortunately, every time he moves he presses on my bladder and I suddenly *have to pee* even if I just went five minutes before.  Two seconds later he moves again and I don't have to go anymore.  It's like that pretty much all day.  Now I'm imagining him doing tai chi in there, with the slow, controlled, stretchy movements.  I'm sure it's very zen-like in there.
TwoXChromosomes X Same here, I used to get horrible UTI's, but not often anymore.  It would probably be a good idea to give yourself a break from all those antibiotics. If you take antibiotics to often, you will begin to develop [antibiotic resistant infections]( _resistance), which are much more difficult to get rid of. Seriously, try to drink plenty of water, don't hold it when you have to pee, wipe front to back, always pee after sex, and stay off the antibiotics.    
TwoXChromosomes X I know you said you don't have a great memory, but I use Levora (hormonal, pill) and like it quite a bit. Also, weirdly enough and I'm not sure how this has worked, I've never forgotten a pill even though I'm awful at remembering obligations. It's also helped with my skin and made periods a lot less awful and unpredictable (which is why I take it), so I'd recommend it if you're considering a pill form. 
BabyBumps X I'm taking a 6 week course in planned childbirth and breastfeeding through the hospital I'm going to for l &amp; d. I know most of the stuff they say, so far anyway. But, it gives me a lot of insight into how my hospital operates, and I get to tour the facilities and things like that. My husband is learning a lot, which gives me peace of mind. He hasn't read any baby books or done much research on what is happening in ny body. So it has really helped me feel closer to him. Last night, he randomly said, "How cool is it that the baby is still small enough it can flip around in there?"   I'm sure I'll learn some relaxation techniques as we go along. Each class is set up for a large learning section, then relaxation techniques at the end.   I'm 26 weeks, and the farthest from my due date in the class. But it worked best for hubby's schedule so it is what we are doing.  
BabyBumps X I had an ultrasound today and couldn't believe how much it moved! Last time we saw it, it was a tiny little blob and didn't really do much. Today it was rolling around, lying upside down, having a grand old time.
BabyBumps X I'm a large lady, but I've been sick A LOT this pregnancy and I haven't made it back up to pre-pregnancy weight.  The doctors will determine if everything is going well by checking the baby's growth, not yours.  I'm measured every time I go in, and the doctor is not worried.
TwoXChromosomes X You would be more discreet with an IUD but I don't think that's a good option.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it for someone who hasn't been pregnant.  My obgyn refused to give me one for that very reason since the uterus is quite small in comparison and can be quite painful.  Another issue would be cost.  Wouldn't that show up on the insurance?  Edit:  Sigh...FFS people. I'm aware that my previous misconception about reasons for placing IUD is incorrect as I generalized it. The fact still remains that OP seems to be concerned about insurance/cost since she's on her mother's insurance and from what I know, IUDs have pretty expensive costs so that's something to consider besides just the *possibility* that the IUD may not be a good option comfort-wise.  
BabyBumps X I'll be starting a Bradley method class with the hubby later this month. From the description it seemed like it would work well for us since I rely on him a lot for support and he'll be there for the labor and birth. I also like that the class is pretty in depth. I start April 24 but the last class is technically AFTER my due date of July 4. It's also not just a sit and listen type of thing, but a 'practice it together' deal. I'm looking forward to it :)   I would probably also do well with Lamaze or Hypnobirthing. I also looked into hospital classes but since I don't intend to go to a hospital unless events progress to that point (I'm going to a birthing center instead) I feel a bit like I shouldn't take up a spot for someone who IS going to that hospital, if that makes sense.
BabyBumps X I had this early on, and found that doing hip stretches at night really helped me for the next day. (Bent knee pulled across to your other side, one at a time.)
TwoXChromosomes X Why would you say that (:  People here just don't like to hear an opposing point of view even though it makes sense.    I am pro choice.  If a woman is raped or has sex responsibly and gets pregnant and has an abortion that is fine.  If a woman gets an abortion in her first trimester I'm OK with that too.  What bothers me is that I know people who have gotten multiple abortions like its no big deal.  Some people are for 3rd trimester abortion and that I just do not understand.    
TwoXChromosomes X I personally have an IUD, and the insertion was the most "painful part" that was nothing more than mild cramping. 
TwoXChromosomes X Oh I know.  If someone gets an abortion because they were raped or the fetus is putting the mothers life in danger then I am all for abortion.  I really am pro choice.  I just don't understand how so many people here see it as such a black and white issue.   
BabyBumps X Congrats on the new little gentleman! Looks like you have great instincts when it comes to your baby. I thought that my baby was going to be a boy and my hubby thought it was a girl. My hubby was right and we are very excited to be having a girl.  Guess my instincts on gender aren't good :) 
TwoXChromosomes X Why does the death penalty bother me?  I don't know him and hes a criminal so so what if he dies.    It bothers me because if someone gets 20 abortions that to me is just having no respect for human life.  
TwoXChromosomes X I think it can really depend on your body shape and how comfortable you are sticking your hand up and fishing around.  For me, there is absolutely no where for it to go to get lost.  I can easily reach it even though I completely took the stem off (I never found the stem useful because my removal technique is pinching the base to break the seal and then gently tugging out to dump it).  If you can squat, bearing down on it while in the bathtub if you can't get it out is an easy way to avoid a big mess...though once you get the hang of it this is incredibly unlikely to happen.  Also, once the cup fills up it unsuctions itself--the biggest problem is actually panicking.  There is no where for the cup to go, if you relax and calm down odds are good you'll be able to get the thing out.  So, yes there's a learning curve, yes there are cases where it's not the right choice for you--but the worst case scenario isn't as bad as it seems and if you manage to learn how to use it the diva cup is easy, less drying/irritating for most than pads or tampons, environmentally friendly and cost effective.  It's not for everyone and your own choices have got to make sense to you before anyone else--but if you are capable of squatting odds are incredibly high you can get it out just fine.  If you're really worried there are menstrual cups that have different shaped handle like protrusions on the bottom.
TwoXChromosomes X When I went for my arm implant, the nurse told me that an IUD would actually have been more natural and less painful. I'm happy with my implanon, but I think an IUD is a good choice, too. 
BabyBumps X my entire pregnancy:   DR/MOM/WHOEVER: so has the baby been kicking much?   ME: oh yeah, all the time. actually she's kicking right now!   DR/MOM/WHOEVER: oh really? let me feel...   BABY: LOLNO \*is totally still\*   DR/MOM/WHOEVER: was she *really* kicking?   ME: yes, i swear! D:
TwoXChromosomes X I love not having a period! I am on the pill and it took about 6 months to stop spotting and randomly bleeding but it has been worth it ever since!
BabyBumps X Lots of nausea in early pregnancy but no vomitting (except once I think.) Worse symptom has been my fatigue. I would sleep 18 hours at a time my first trimester. Other than that it has been an easy pregnancy.  Since I hit 35w (I'm 37w3d now) I've been extremely irritable. Everyone annoys the crap outta me. I've been so mean and I feel like I can't help it. I can't even pretend to be nice or in a good mood.  Now today I have been feeling completely unmotivated. I think I've left my bed twice the entire day. Feeling very mopey, sad, even got a little teary. All for no reason at all really. Having what I can only describe as hot flashes. I get very sweaty then I'm fine. Also having bad acid reflux. Other than that, I feel in no way different physically. No cramping, no braxton hicks (haven't had any since last week some time), no sickness of any kind.  That's why I asked the question, I was curious as to how others felt before they delivered. Wanted to give myself a glimmer of hope that maybe today or maybe the next day could be the day for me lol.
BabyBumps X Awwwwe I hope it happens soon for you.  While your in bed, this is going to sound weird but start playing with your nipples.  My midwife had me do that every hour after my water broke.  Also she suggested a lot of walks too so that might help get things going for ya.  I went into labor at 37 weeks 4 days so it may be coming up for you soon.  Especially if you have been feeling so tired.  Your body may be getting the much needed rest before the marathon of labor.     Oh do you have any pets??  Have they been acting funny?  Our dog got really really needy and needed to sleep on me the night my water broke. 
BabyBumps X I've been taking Flintstone gummies this pregnancy.  I can't stand the pills that have iron in them.  They make me so sick!
BabyBumps X Your story is a lot like mine. #1 was 10lb 3oz and 42+3 at the scheduled c-section. I went into labor naturally with #2 but she wouldn't come out, so after a lengthy process she was also a c-section. But I absolutely got to try and I was told that uterine rupture was a very slight possibility, like sign a consent form caliber, not panic caliber.
BabyBumps X I have a friend who had a VBAC with her 2nd.  Her first was breech and they had to do an emergency c-section.  Her 2nd was born naturally and everything worked out great.  Just make sure you have a doc who is educated in VBACs.
TwoXChromosomes X It's normal to be irregular the first few months of switching to a new pill. However, if you're worried, call your doctor.
BabyBumps X I feel you. My doctor told me yesterday that my cervix is soft but closed. On the plus side, he was able to feel the baby's head, which he couldn't last week, so maybe things are progressing? I'm just getting antsy. 
BabyBumps X I got my membranes stripped 3 times and still had to be induced. Not saying it won't work for you, but it didn't for me.
TwoXChromosomes X If by extra testing you mean a pap smear, they're now doing those later relative to your first sexual experience, and less frequently in general. 
BabyBumps X I was in labor for a total of 9 hours (first kiddo), and 30 minutes of that was pushing.  I went to the hosp at about 4.5 centimeters dilated and was immediately given an epidural.  A few hours later I was fully dilated and could still feel my contractions through the epidural, just not nearly as strong.  It was just enough to let me push with them to get baby out as quickly as possibly!  Doc didn't tell me how badly I tore, but I was starting to tear when he did the episiotomy..sooo.. I guess it could have been much worse.  I swore by that damned bottle for a good week after I was released.  So nice... and clean!
BabyBumps X I know the feeling. I was 5 weeks along when I took my pregnancy test, and it turned positive so quickly I nearly fainted.
Parenting X If he's breastfed, you should stay on the stage 1 (low flow) nipples to prevent him refusing the breast.   It may be the way you're feeding him. He should be as upright as possible (not lying down), and you should be holding the bottle perpendicular to him, while keeping the nipple filled with milk at all times. If you upend the bottle into him, he'll gulp air and milk way faster than he's ready for, as gravity forces it all down his throat.   The technique I mentioned is called "Paced feeding." Additionally, you can try the Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. In recent research done on bottles for breastfed babes, they ranked up at the top, along with the PlayTex VentAire bottles with the newborn nipples. You want a bottle that drips 8mL/min when upended, because the use of suction to get food is really important for your baby's oral muscular structure development! 
TwoXChromosomes X Hi! Don't be skurred. I had several cysts on both ovaries--and had no idea until one ruptured (it was about the same size as yours).          I had surgery to remove the biggest one, and the surgeon popped the other six or so while she was in there. Two incisions each an inch long--one for the camera, one for the cutty-thing. Recovery wasn't bad at all. Now I take birth control to stop any new cysts from forming.          I am not a doctor, but I was told that they would only take the ovary out if it's in [torsion]( _torsion). That means the cyst weighs so heavily on the ovary, it pulls it down and twists it around, cutting off blood supply and essentially killing it. I was also told this is not the norm.          So for me, it wasn't a bad experience. My Nana passed of Ovarian cancer a few years ago and I was told that my cysts were not related.                So try not to stress out. Whatever will be, will be, and you'll deal with it accordingly.          TL;DR Had cysts. Not anymore. Badass scars. 
Parenting X With a breastfed baby, stick to the slowest flow nipple no matter how old the baby gets.    Follow this as far as how to bottle feed the baby: -tools/bottle-feeding/  Keep the quantity small.  No more than 2-3oz per bottle.  Breastfed babies eat on average 1oz per hour, doesn't matter how old they are.  So give him a little, try to help him eat slowly and be sitting up, pause for burping, and offer a pacifier if he still wants to suck.    Feeding him at the earliest signs of hunger is typically easier than when they are really frantic and screaming for it.  Also - there's a [/r/breastfeeding](/r/breastfeeding) subreddit. :)  You'll tend to get more breastfeeding-friendly advice over there.  
Parenting X Honestly, in our experience with our three children, the age on the package for the nipples is a suggestions. My current infant went right into the fast flows (6+mos) at about 6 weeks. My only suggestion is to try it for a few days and see if he gets used to the faster flow. I have heard though that if he goes to the fast flow ones that he might refuse the breast. Your wife could need to pump more, but gulping air is not gooed either. Perhaps try a different bottle with a smaller nipple? My son needed smaller nipples. Even the closer to nature nipples don't conform like the soft tissue of the breast to the childs mouth and his mouth might not be big enough for the nipple.   Hope it all works out.
BabyBumps X I was just reading in my The everything pregnancy organizer that as long as you dont go over 50 pounds of weight gain during pregnancy that you should be able to get back to your pre pregnancy weight with not too much difficulty. I put on 40 each pregnancy and take it off in the first 4 months. Hell, lost 22 pounds just by giving birth last time. 
TwoXChromosomes X The only brand of tampons I've found that don't feel "loose" to me are natracare organic tampons. Admittedly, I haven't used many different brands, but when I've used regular tampons like tampax pearl and kotex, they just never seemed to fit properly. 
BabyBumps X From what I understand, if you are exclusively going to pump at some point you will need a hospital grade pump. Exclusively using a lower quality pump will often cause your supply to dwindle too low.  
BabyBumps X Then after baby was born I lost another 10 pounds in the next week so just a week after delivery I had lost 32 pounds. 
TwoXChromosomes X "full term" is actually 37 weeks, it's just that typical gestation is 40 weeks - the baby spends ~3 weeks at full term in utero, with everything fully developed, just gaining weight. and LMP is generally only used to calculate your due date until ultrasound measurements can give a more accurate gestational age. for example, my first ultrasound was at 8 weeks 4 days from LMP, but the measurements indicated a gestational age of 8 weeks 2 days, so they adjusted my due date from 12-15 to 12-17 (how i got pregnant while i was on my period, i have no clue). it's not that they're actually including 2 weeks prior to conception in the pregnancy, but different women have different cycles in which they may ovulate very shortly after their last period, conservative estimates for the date of conception begin right after your period starts.
TwoXChromosomes X To be fair lung development still occurs after 37 weeks. My cousin had a baby at 37 and it had to go to NICU for a few weeks. The last 3 weeks are still important. 
BabyBumps X It was a big surprise. I was in hospital,( 1st December) with high blood pressure, doc examined me and I was dilated 2cms. she said, I would be induced on or before the 18th (December). Half an hour later, they rushed me to delivery for an induction, and about three hours later she was born.  I was I shock for about a week. 
BabyBumps X Pregnancy is calculated as 9 calendar months (40 weeks) from the first day of your last menstrual cycle to the date of delivery.  So yeah, you're technically 4 weeks pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X The babies who die one hour after birth due to severe disabilities/defect beg to differ... As well as the mother whose foestus would put their life in great peril were they to carry the pregnancy to its term. 
BabyBumps X Hi hi hi! I first felt my baby at the end of 15 weeks, and it was intense. I was laying on my back and felt something poke me from the inside, which I assume was a kick or punch. Since then they only got stronger.  I had pretty nice abs, too. I wasn't expecting anything until maybe 18 weeks.  :D
BabyBumps X Baby might just be laying transverse right now -- which is totally okay! Baby has quite a few weeks left to turn into a cephalic presentation.
BabyBumps X People still can't tell that I'm pregnant. My friend on the other hand, is a week behind me, and definitely looks pregnant. Everyone is different. It all depends on how you carry the weight on your body. Don't worry about them saying you shouldn't be showing. If you are, then you should be. :)
TwoXChromosomes X Ultrasound doesn't show age.  Ultrasound shows physical size.  Suppose the ultrasound tells you the baby is 1/2 inch in length.  Fetuses are usually 1/2 inch in length eight weeks after LMP, or six weeks after conception.  The convention is to report the age as the eight weeks past LMP.
BabyBumps X Light bleeding and cramping is normal.  As long as it's not heavy bleeding or extreme cramps (picture your worst period cramps on crack) you should be fine.
TwoXChromosomes X If you ran off to the pharmacy tomorrow, you wouldn't get accurate results anyway. The chances of you being pregnant, while there, are very, *very* low. Wait until your period. If you're late, go get a pregnancy test. But right now is way too early for any kind of accurate result. Also, if you do get one, get a multi-pack with 2 or 3 tests. Take it first thing in the morning. If it comes back negative, take another a few days later if you still don't get your period. You're probably fine though, don't worry!
BabyBumps X The opposite isn't fun either...I kept getting told I was tiny by others and if I didn't have a recent ultrasound that showed a normal size baby, I would have been nervous something was wrong. my midwife said that everyone is different and carries differently...don't let them get you down! It's always nice to get reassurance from the doctor or midwife. When people tell me I am small, I just say that the ultrasound showed she was growing normally. 
TwoXChromosomes X No. Gestational age is only used when conception has occurred and doctors are trying to figure out your due date. That doesn't mean you're pregnant before conception. Gestational age =/= date of fertilization/conception.
BabyBumps X I had bleeding for 2 days around week 7 - really light, brownish pink. It stopped, and as far as I know it's still doing fine in there! I think I read that 20-30% of women experience spotting and it's normal, for them. If it's accompanied by cramps or turns from spotting into darker, heavier, clotty flow then you can worry.
TwoXChromosomes X Right? I'm totally opposed to this bill but it has nothing to do with how they determine the age of the fetus. I also didn't understand all the backlash about the transvaginal ultrasounds. I had an abortion. They did a transvaginal ultrasound because that's the best way to see a tiny fetus and prepare for the abortion and they determined the gestational age the same way they always do. 
TwoXChromosomes X After the bread mold scare with Playtex, I'd rather stick to something I can see or at least check out before I insert it.  OB tampons or something similar for me.
BabyBumps X People widely vary in their progression of labor, but the bloody mucous is a good sign that you are at least dilating a bit. I would guess you will probably go into labor soon-ish, but that could still be a week (or more) away so stay as rested and hydrated as possible. 
BabyBumps X Hi, I just gave birth 3 weeks ago to our son and I was also gung-ho on natural childbirth. Read many books, saw Business of Being Born, and did lots of research on line. My husband and I took the hypnobabies course.   We did a private class that was about 6 weeks long, 3 hours to each class. In a nutshell, each class has a topic to go over (nutrition during pregnancy, actually delivery and positions to promote comfort, etc) as well as a script that the instructor reads to you, teaching you gradually how to put yourself into deep relaxation and hypnosis. You are expected to practice each day what you learned. The goal is that you will be able to put yourself (with assistance from CDs and your birth partner), into hypnosis (but still be alert, able to move around and communicate) during the birthing process.  There are definitely some pros and cons. I also had a pregnancy loss with my first pregnancy at 20 weeks. After having a miscarriage, this pregnancy was obviously somewhat anxiety provoking for us. So, learning tips to help relax and go into hypnosis was helpful during the pregnancy. It is a super intense course where you really learn a lot about childbirth and are encouraged to have lots of open dialogue with your birth partner about the pregnancy itself as well as the delivery.   As pro-natural birth as I was, our son was breach and we ended up having an emergency c-section so I didn't get to use the  techniques during the actually delivery, but I did listen to the CDs to help keep me stay calm during my contracts and prior to the c-section.   The one thing I would tell you is that it is A LOT Of preparation and work. (THey don't like to call it homework, they call it home play). Basically you are expected to practice various things everyday. You have to get your body to associate certain cues with relaxation. Every other day, your partner will read a script to you where you practice hypnosis (which takes about 30 mins or so), and on the off days, you listen to a CD where the script is read for you (which are usually about 20-30 mins).   If you are someone who is super busy or feel like you won't practice at all, this may not be the class for you. Or, if you don't have a birth partner who is on board because it really demands a lot of time from both of you.   At least for us,  I think it did help us relax and stay calm despite the fact that we had a c-section. I would be curious to see how it would have worked if I had actually give vaginal birth.    I am happy to answer more questions if there are specifics you want to know. Good luck and congrats on this pregnancy!
TwoXChromosomes X Condoms don't protect much against herpes and HPV because there's still skin-skin contact.  They do, however, protect against chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and AIDS.  And all of those feel like this --&gt;:((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
TwoXChromosomes X What's wrong with the pull out method? It prevents pregnancy at a similar rate as condoms. 
BabyBumps X Personally for me, I keep hearing it is fine but me having one glass of wine or one beer just isn't worth it. I drink when I want to get a buzz, and it would take a significant amount of alcohol so it's not worth it. So I just abstain.  
TwoXChromosomes X Natural, intact here. There is quite the difference. Condom-less sex feels much better. The thin latex might not seem like much, but it's quite the barrier to the warmth, wet and internal feeling of textures and friction which you don't experience with a condom. My girlfriend prefers it without too, or at least she says she does.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Plenty of people think abortion is wrong for themselves, but wouldn't make that choice for others.  Many Pro-Life people see the fetus as a living human that deserves the rights of one.  It's like the slave metaphor; see it like this: "Plenty of people think slavery is wrong for themselves, but wouldn't make that choice for others."  We have determined that fetuses are alive and they are human, which are facts.  A logical conclusion to draw from that fact for many people would be to say that living humans deserve the rights of a living human; and that includes not to be murdered when you have done no wrong.
Parenting X She is still in the NICU. She was born at 28 weeks, her mom almost died from pneumonia, and was in a coma for 9 days. She's progressing very well at the NICU, and we are now visiting her every day to kangaroo. I'm hoping we can take her home very soon, but she's still having a few apnea and bradycardia events every few days. Her weight started at 1049 grams, and is now up to 1531 grams today.
TwoXChromosomes X I have met a ridiculous amount of people who said that zygotes are 'not' alive and therefore should not have any rights.  I didn't because I didn't think it was relevant to my point - if you insist, though, I would say it depends where it is, considering 'murder' is defined as 'the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another'.  Clearly it was premeditated, and the unlawful part depends on where you are.  Whether it is *wrong* or not is up for debate; I have no opinion on that now.  I don't think it's equivalent to the abortion of a human fetus for several reasons, though:  1.  The elderly person is at the end of their life.  The fetus has barely begun theirs.  2.  The elderly person seems to have no chance of recovery or returning to normal life, no matter how much time they are given.  The fetus will be born and further grow as a human and experience normal life, if given enough time.  3.  In a vegetative state, the person cannot feel or experience the outside world ever again in this scenario.  A fetus, after time, can and will feel pain and will begin to sense things.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;A logical conclusion to draw from that fact for many people would be to say that living humans deserve the rights of a living human; and that includes not to be murdered when you have done no wrong.  I don't think that's really the logical conclusion to draw from that.  Yes fetuses are alive and they are human.  It doesn't make the fetus deserving of human rights.  As it stands, embryos and fetuses are dependent on a person to survive so their rights must be considered in relation to the woman who is carrying it.  My beliefs say that the embryo or fetus has no real rights as it's supposed right to life infringes upon the woman's right to not be forced into pregnancy, give birth, have a child, etc.  I'm not attacking your right to feel differently, but it seems as though you are saying all pro-choice positions are illogical, when really what you mean is that you disagree.
TwoXChromosomes X It seems like you have a lot of reasons to get an abortion: you're not financially or emotionally ready to raise a child, the child's father would not be a part of the child's life, and there could be nasty court battles. It seems like you also have a few reasons to give birth: you are enamored with the idea of your potential child's beauty and talent and you might be happy to give it up for adoption. It seems that in this case, you will want to get an abortion, in order to spare yourself the nastiness of your family's legal battles and the pain you may experience from giving away a child - an actual child and not a fetus - that you care so much about. In fact, despite what anti-choicers claim, a lot of evidence shows that more teens who give their baby up for adoption are more traumatized by their decision than teens who get abortions. My next door neighbor is someone who decided to give birth to her baby and give the baby up for adoption rather than get an abortion, but couldn't bear to give her child away once the time came. So she dropped out of college temporarily - which became permanently, her daughter has a constantly stressed/angry mom and doesn't have a dad, and in general, it seems like being a poor, young, unprepared mother without a committed father was a terrible choice for my neighbor and for my neighbor's child. Just my two cents.   If you decide to get the abortion, you'll definitely want to bring a friend with you for support. And the father should ABSOLUTELY be paying for half the cost, especially since he's the one encouraging it. He is taking responsibility for his actions and paying half the cost, right? Or did he just ditch you to foot the bill?
Parenting X I feel for you, mine was in the NICU for about two months, though was not born early. She had some massive heart issues but we are recovering from surgery. She's like a totally different baby, healthy and thriving. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Look into getting a Paragard IUD, they last for 10 years and once you have it, you have it. no more getting dicked around like this  Sadly, if OP really does have bad cramps, Paragard is not the way to go. It makes cramps and bleeding worse. How long is lasts with minimal upkeep was one of the major selling points for me, but it has made my (normally not very difficult) period hell-on-earth for far too long now. I have spent hundreds on doctors to make sure nothing else was amiss, and now I am planning to have it removed so I can spend hundreds more on another BC solution.  Mirena, which lasts for only 5 years, might be a better investment, if cramps are an issue.
BabyBumps X We told everyone pretty much off the bat haha, I wanted to wait but I just couldn't. I'm 14 weeks now. Hope you have a lovely pregnancy :)
TwoXChromosomes X It goes from basically 0% to 50% or higher within just a few weeks. At 22 weeks the chance that you can save a foetus born prematurely is very low, and many of the ones that do survive have life-long complications. At 24 weeks the chances have improved dramatically.   Anyway, I never really liked the viability criteria. If technology made it possible to have a embryo and foetus grow in-vitro would that make abortion unethical from the moment of conception?
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure what the point of that was - is it just that the mother should have the final say in whether or not she carries the pregnancy to term? I'm pretty sure we all know that pregnancy is uncomfortable and potentially dangerous, and that you have to give up some foods and activities for a few months; the scary-sounding items under the "less common (but serious) complications," meanwhile, go undefined.  Yes, there is a certain element of risk to pregnancy and childbirth - but that's why you get under an OB/GYN's care as soon as you suspect that you're pregnant. They will monitor you for the symptoms of all of these potential problems and treat you as needed.
TwoXChromosomes X I absolutely loved my Nuva Ring. But I kept getting yeast Infections. I couldn't stay on other birth controls because of weight gain, hormone craziness, but mostly - I kept forgetting to take the pill and would have 2-3 periods a month from skipping pills. Not very safe/effective. (I'm on BC officially for Ovarian Cysts- Parents don't know I'm sexually active, but I'm 23... so... anywho.)   I got Mirena placed in early January. It sucked bad for the first two days. Placement didn't sit well with me, but it's different for everyone. The doctor didn't tell me to hang out and lay down while my uterus finished adjusting, so I hopped up and left... then almost passed out and threw up in the waiting room.   Then cramping was pretty bad on and off for the first two months. The first time I was supposed to get my period I couldn't move out of bed for about an hour or so... Any time my boyfriend nicked my uterus the cramping would start again.    Now...4 months later... I have next to no cramping and I'm fairly happy with it. I'm not sure it was completely worth it, but things they didn't tell me would happen did. I got acne back. I also got facial hair back. I wish someone told me those were possible side effects. (They aren't from the Mirena, but more so from the lack of good side effects from BC). Initially my boyfriend felt the strings and they poked him unpleasantly... but that happened twice before the strings curled upwards and haven't been felt since.   So... I guess I don't really recommend either way haha. Just pointing out some things that I wish people told me.   Also- During these four months - I spotted a lot the first month, but since then I've had 1 period that lasted ... maybe 12 hours? I hope to not see more returning periods. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had the Mirena for the five years and as reported by thunder_goes_boom, my periods totally stopped.  Unfortunately, I experienced some pretty severe Vertigo from it.  I also developed fibromyalgia and pretty intense joint pain and weight gain from it.  Of course, I didn't know at the time these things were from my IUD.  When it was time to have it replaced, I decided to go with the Paraguard copper IUD.  It lasts ten years instead of five and its hormone free.  That was about a year and half ago.  Here's my experience so far:  Periods returned within two months.  For the first few months they were a bit heavier than normal and the cramps were a little worse.  This has since evened out and my periods come on schedule, last 4-5 days and experience moderate cramps and pms.  Its essentially what it was years ago. No weird coppery smell or anything.  I forget its there to be honest.    Interestingly, I have lost 20 lbs without trying very hard.  My fibro is almost non-existent and my Vertigo is totally gone.    So, there is my experience.  I don't know that its a typical one.  I found that most women do not experience the drastic side-effects I did from the Mirena.  Its too bad though, because not having your period for five years sort of rocks.    Having either of the IUD's inserted/removed didn't hurt.  Its more like a pelvic exam with a bit more cramping than usual.  Really not a big deal.  I felt totally fine afterwards.  Never had a complaint from my husband about strings or feeling anything and he's uh, well, hung like a circus pony to be blunt!  Its pretty awesome to not have to remember to take a pill or go for shots.  My body reacts pretty badly to most hormonal forms of bc so the Paraguard has been pretty awesome.  By the time I have to have it removed I'll be 47-48 yo.  
TwoXChromosomes X I got the ParaGuard 10 months ago and absolutely love it. No hormonal side affects, no related wight gain, natural periods!  Cramping is increased for the first few days after insertion. Periods are a little heavier and more painful first 6 months. But very easy to maintain and way cheaper in the long run.  I would recommend!! Let me know if you have more questions. 
BabyBumps X I had various types of bleeding during weeks 5-7.  I was worried sick and went to the doctor several times.  Each time, I had an exam and ultrasound which confirmed that everything was okay.  I'm now 24 weeks.  My doctor said that about 30% of pregnancies bleed in the first trimester and he wasn't worried at all.  Potential reasons:  Extra fluffy lining, slight blood leak from where the placenta is forming on the uterine wall, placenta forming near the cervix, and my least favorite:  "We don't know".  I was told to rest and drink plenty of water.  I was tempted to pee with the light off and wear black underwear because it was causing me so much damn stress - I literally had heartache.  Hang in there and if you need reassurance, call your doctor - they can give you an ultrasound and check on your little one.
BabyBumps X Ohh, so cute!  I'm jealous, hit 15 weeks yesterday, still no bump.  My pooch is raised higher though, haha.
BabyBumps X Women: not gaining much weight and having a healthy baby is totally doable. I was overweight prepregnancy (169ish). I ended my pregnancy at 189ish. I weighed myself this morning, 174. 
BabyBumps X I had a 15 week gender scan, because I was impatient. I could tell right away, after searching online for pictures of babies at 15 weeks, what I was looking at right away when it was time. He very clearly had a penis. However, the tech never got a good picture of his genitals, so I didn't feel 100% confident.   Later, at the 20 week anatomy scan, within the first 5 minutes, the tech got a shot from below baby's bum. "You were told boy?" she asked. I think I stopped breathing. Once again, there was no mistaking... there were the telltale three lines. Right there, three lines. So... I was having a girl. I sat there in shock, cursing myself for going early to the first scan, trying to make myself feel something positive. I'd actually been a little disappointed with finding out we were having a boy, but then I got so used to the idea.  Later on in the ultrasound, about 30 minutes later, she doubled back to the genitals... and there was a penis. The little troll had clamped his legs closed so hard that he caused his scrotum to form three lines. But, again, there was a scrotum and penis, and that time we got a good pic.  But if she hadn't doubled back to check, we'd have a ton of girly stuff in that nursery by now.  Now when people ask me what I'm having, I say, "Boy... (under breath) supposedly..."  We'll see in a bit!
BabyBumps X Man!  I had a scan at 12 weeks because my doctor couldn't find the heartbeat right away.  We went over to another office and we got to see the baby on the ultrasound, but I didn't even think to ask if the doctor could tell or not.  Maybe it was too early then to tell, but I wish I had thought to ask!  Not that it matters, but I think I'm having a boy because of this rampant heartburn I've been having (old wive's tale, I know).  
TwoXChromosomes X I think that essentially everyone who is pro-choice supports the increased use of reliable contraception and I think for the most part it has been the pro-choice movement (not the pro-life movement) has promoted this as part of their position.  I'm not sure exactly what you are calling for.  There will always be some accidents and birth control failures, but regardless of the reason for the unwanted pregnancy, women should have an absolute right to an abortion.  I think the fact that we still need to focus on abortion itself is that there are currently a lot of restrictions being placed on it (in the US) so it's very relevant to focus on abortion rights as well as contraception.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine went in fairly easily with a little pain.  I've never had cramps in my life, but I had them (not very painful) for about a month or so after insertion.  Spotting for a month or so, weird periods (but light) after that, no periods after that.  Bleeding the first couple of times I had sex, but no pain
TwoXChromosomes X Don't worry about the fact that you might go through all of this to get bc and then end up single. No matter if you stay with this guy or not, you know that in the future you will be protected and hopefully won't have to go through this again. (although condoms aren't still a great idea to prevent stds and as an extra pregnancy prevention barrier, so don't necessarily give them up even if you have an iud)
TwoXChromosomes X Honestly? You're most probably fine. I wouldn't worry about taking a test unless your period is late.  However - it might be worth looking into some sort of long-term birth control, as the stress just isn't worth it!
BabyBumps X When you say induced what does your doc have planned?  When I was 3 cm and fully effaced they just broke my water for me and I went totally on my own after that.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, you can make requests either way.  I would just want to mention it so that the doctor would be sure to keep the strings long enough so they go soft and curl around your cervix.  Some women had them cut short and either their partner could feel the pointy tips during sex, or the strings disappear into the cervix making removal difficult.
Parenting X The size, I don't think that'll be an issue. They were 6lb5oz and 6lb14oz at birth, 37 weeks &amp; 4 days. 19 and 21 inches long. First born was the 6lb5... he had some issues &amp; spent some time in the NICU, weight dropped to 5lb11oz when we left the hospital. Almost had to be hospitalized again.   And now? The "runt"? He's 33 inches tall and weighs 34lbs. The other is 31 inches and 27lbs. But, dad is 6'0 and I'm 5'11. We had to switch doctors when they were 13 months. The doctor &amp; staff were absolutely floored by their size considering they were twins.   Pretty sure they're gonna be some mean lookin' men.
BabyBumps X My doc. said 18 hours post breaking my waters because of infection risk.  I'm honestly not opposed to a c-section, if it comes to it.  As long as my baby is healthy, I'm okay with whatever happens.  Just ready for it to be over.  Ha.    Edit:  I'm 3cm dilated and fully effaced already, so we'll see!
BabyBumps X I was sent to emergency from work last Thursday (at 17 weeks) and the emergency doctor told me that what I had was a threatened miscarriage. 
TwoXChromosomes X When I had mine inserted about 4 years ago I wish I'd taken some ibuprofen or something ahead of time. I heard they can also numb the cervix? When I replaced it with the Paraguard a few months ago and took the ibuprofen ahead of time it was much easier to get through it. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I had the too much hormone issue on many BCPs even some "low" dose ones. I found that Aleese28 was the best pill for me but I kinda hated having to take it all the time. I switched to Nuva ring when it was pretty new. I liked it and had no side effects but the out of pocket cost was just too much for me at $80 to $110 a month.   
TwoXChromosomes X The battle for pregnancy prevention also needs to be fought but the 3 women I know who have had unplanned pregnancies and abortions had them because their pregnancy prevention failed. One had a broken condom when she was 19 and she couldn't afford the morning-after pill (live in the UK so abortions are a less tricky issue financially). The second was on the pill, took it perfectly but her pharmacist had been switching all the BC pills in his care to placebos (he was caught and prosecuted later) and the third was given medication to take and her doctor told her it would have no effect on the pill and she was perfectly safe, needless to say that was not true.   What I'm getting at is that a lot of unwanted pregnancies occur because preventative methods fail, no preventative is 100% failsafe. These people are often not careless but their contraception failed them. Tarring them with the same brush as someone who just didn't use any contraception really isn't fair. The experience of thinking you were safe and then being told you weren't for whatever reason is traumatic enough without also being told you were "careless" and your abortion shouldn't be supported. 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, first off, if you are in your 3rd week of the BC, just tough out the 4th week. Now are you sexually active or is this for medical reasons? If you're sexually active, go out and buy another form of protection like a condom. If it's medical reasons, you'll have to tough them out for a bit. Try to get to your doctor ASAP and ask about another brand of BC that may not have such a strong dosage and get that prescription filled. Once you finish your pack of BC you are already taking, start taking the new BC. The reason why I tell you to get condoms if you are active is it takes about 4 days before the new BC starts protecting you so you're vulnerable to getting pregnant in that time frame.              Birth Control isn't something you can choose to take one day and something you don't wanna take the next day. I understand that this certain brand didn't work for you, and that's okay, but don't stop taking any BC midcycle unless told by your gyno. The pill isn't for fun, it changes your body's hormones and messing with them is not a good idea. The reason why the last few pills in your pack are a different color- they're hormone free (or sort of hormone free depending on your brand) and once you finish those, your hormones should go back to normal or close to it. It's then safe to start a new brand or to stop taking it altogether. But never, ever stop taking a pill mid cycle. If your gyno told you not to take your pill anymore, ask her when to start taking your new pill, but I assume it would be the day after the pack you already have should be finished (I believe that means you will take it on this Sunday). Hope it helps! :)
BabyBumps X walked by from r/breastfeeding. Hang in there: it's super hard, but so worth it, even if it's just one meal a day.   My midwife told me that babies are essentially tiny humans, meaning, that they are as lazy as the rest of us. Given the choice between easy feeding with a bottle or having to work at the breast, they will mostly prefer the bottle. Unless mom "sweetens the deal" with constant loving contact and attention (which will tire you out), or making it the only choice. If you can, pump, and SNS. =( good luck
TwoXChromosomes X The point is that the law is outdated, as it went into effect before Roe v Wade and before RU-486.  Additionally, most legal matters regarding abortions target doctors, not women who get abortions.  And why did this woman take RU-486? Because she couldn't afford a $500 abortion or multiple trips back and forth to a clinic far away.  Putting enough restrictions on abortion won't stop it.  Women will do what they need to do no matter what, and in cases like this, they wind up putting their own lives at risk.
BabyBumps X Kicking my cervix, ALWAYS. At first it was tickly and fun. No more. I can't wait for this kid to move head down. 
BabyBumps X The only reason I ever heard about not being able to eat is in case of an emergency c-section where you are put under general anesthesia. I guess it depends on where you are and what they do, but general anesthesia is not the common practice for emergency c-section anymore. If you were already having an epidural they would work with that, or they would give you a spinal in an emergency. That way you are still awake for the operation and there is minimal risk.  When getting an epidural, a common side effect is a drop in blood pressure so an IV of fluids is introduced to offset this. That would be one reason to have IV fluids during labour.   I plan on eating and drinking during my labour because, like you,I think how the hell are you supposed to be able to push out a baby when you have been starved for a day! Thankfully my midwives are of the same mind. So I will be packing snacks and a few sandwiches to bring with me for sure.
TwoXChromosomes X So, on the pill does your uterus lining still build up and need to be shed?
TwoXChromosomes X This might mean that you are not taking a high enough dose for your body. Larger women and women with more severe period symptoms are often put on stronger medications. Have you talked to your doctor or pharmacist about this?
BabyBumps X I was not dilated at all at 11pm the night before I had my third. Woke up around 4/5 am in labor. Had her at 4pm same day.  Dilation means NOTHING!
TwoXChromosomes X The problem is that many medical tests can be done at about 20 weeks that could affect the decision to abort. Sometimes at that point it is obvious that a fetus is not developing correctly, and will not survive outside of the womb. Therefore, it is very important to leave the option to abort open until that point. Also, I understand your point about it not just being a bag of cells, but I think that picture gives more of an impression of a live full-term baby than what reality would show. First of all a fetus' lungs would not be developed hardly at all at that point. So, although it may look very human-like on the outside, on the inside it is not even close to developed. Also, a fetus at that point would probably be a little smaller than the size of your hand. I feel like the picture you posted gives the impression that it is larger than that. 
TwoXChromosomes X A cold sore is herpes.  And yeah, you can test for hsv1 and hsv2 specifically by blood test. HerpesSelect ELISA is the test most commonly used for this. 
AskWomen X I just had my second Mirena inserted about six months ago; I had my first for the full five years.  I can't imagine living without it.  I'm one of the lucky ones that don't have periods at all anymore - I had some bleeding after I had the first one inserted in 2006, for about a month straight, but it was not as heavy as a period, just kind of annoying to deal with.  Once it was over, I've never had any bleeding since - even getting the second one inserted just gave me a tiny bit of spotting.  I haven't noticed any side effects, but even if I did I'd have to carefully weigh them against the benefits (no periods for me, being able to have it removed and start trying for a baby anytime I want, no routine hassle with taking a pill, and zero in-the-moment BC worries like with barrier methods.
AskWomen X &gt; And women with a high risk for some STIs should not use an IUD because that risk of STIs combined with the IUD presents a unusually high risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.  And that elevated risk lasts for three weeks after insertion. After that, IUD users' PID risk is identical to non-IUD users'.  Barring (very rare) failures such as an unusually bad perforation, IUDs have zero effect on fertility. In some studies, former IUD users statistically get pregnant _faster_ than women coming off systemic hormonal contraception, most likely because their bodies don't have to reestablish a functional cycle.
BabyBumps X I had horrible hip pain too, and i found the only thing to help me is to go swimming. Now, i only have a bit of pain in the morning. I Highly recommend it!
BabyBumps X That's AWESOME! Congrats!  It's funny- my best friend found out she was pregnant a few weeks after I did... but it turns out she was almost two months ahead of me!!! She just didn't realize it right away :)  It was AMAZING having a close friend to share pregnancy with, and her little girl is going to be a month and a bit older than MY little girl. Awesome.
TwoXChromosomes X Loestrin is actually a pill that causes many women to have no periods; I talked to my doctor about it about 2 weeks ago because I was interested and he said many women experience a light period or spotting, but many also stop having break through bleeding all together - he said he'd actually had many problems having to prescribe new pills to women because the lack of break through bleeding was uncomfortable to them; I told him that ultimately, I'd like to try a different pill because that's not particularly a side effect I would like to experience either.
BabyBumps X For me, the benefits of the classes in person were the techniques I didn't learn from the internet. I took a class online (that same one in fact) with our first- and after doula training, and lactation studies, etc., decided on a physical class for our second. I felt so much more prepared- all my doula training was irrelevant- since I wasn't in the frame of mind for working- I was the one laboring!   On top of that, I met some great couples with the kids the same age- or due around the same time. It was really nice. :-) We didn't take the hospital class, though, we found a class through our community. You have lots of class options, likely, you just may have to dig for them!   Just my own experience!   TL;DR: There are some things you can't really learn online. 
BabyBumps X I haven't been in pain really (other than lower back pain I had before getting pregnant, and that's on and off). Since hitting 20 weeks, though, I've started to feel... uncomfortable. It's not all the time, but I'm suddenly not as full of *OMG SQUEE* that I was around 16 weeks. I did have one day of pelvic pain while at work (lots of sitting, and every time I walked around was painful), but that abated. I will be happy if it stays away.  Also, heartburn started. =/ I'd never experienced this in my whole life until now, and I have to say, I'm NOT a fan. I've never had to eat a Tums, ever, and I don't like trying new foods/things. I'm not looking forward to chewing a tablet that looks like chalk. I'll probably get over it, especially if it helps this damn burning.
TwoXChromosomes X oh please,  religious conservatives like santorum are the ultimate misogynists because they treat woman like they are nothing but breeding cattle.  [a georgia republican wanted to pass a law that would make a woman guilty of murder if she couldn't prove her miscarriage was an accident. doctors don't even know the exact causes of miscarriages]( -lawmaker-proposes-classifying-miscarriages-prenatal-murder-20110225-082612-215.html)  [republicans are trying to pass laws that require women to carry dead clumps of cells for a full term]( -11th-hour-georgia-passes-women-as-livestock-bill/)  you should do a little more research on the human reproductive system and all the things that go wrong with it.   when the egg splits it's a potential life.  60% of all pregnancies are naturally aborted by the body for a multitude of reasons.  god is a more prolific abortion provider than planned parenthood.  the human reproductive system is far from fail safe. that's why we have such raging hormones and fuck so much - to make up for the poor success rate of the reproductive system.  so until about 5-6 months down the gestation period it's a potential life. once it beats the odds and gets to a certain point then it is a baby and a life.  that's why i believe in choice  but i don't support third tri-mester abortions. at that point it succeeded.  and the best part of choice is this - if you don't believe in abortion, with choice, you can choose to not have an abortion.  so choice is the true "pro-women" stance. 
BabyBumps X Actually during my second pregnancy I was in way more pain WAY earlier than my first.  I think I've figured it out though - I think the other two, especially the second one, were low to begin with and pushing down on lots of nerves and joints and stuff.  This one just seems to be floating up high and I guess not causing me much pain!  Hopefully he stays up there until the very last minute.
BabyBumps X I've heard that pitocin definitely makes it harder, but it's not impossible.  Do you think that the doctor could try to induce you without pitocin?  They could give you something to soften your cervix, strip your membranes or even break your water.  If you have to have pitocin, make sure they're not upping it too much, as the more pitocin they pump in, the stronger and closer together the contractions get!
BabyBumps X I had one last time, posterior the other three times.   Kicks for me could feel like either muscle spasms or little tickles, it could honestly still have been baby!  The only thing I know that it effects your pregnancy is first, that you feel less kicks and feel kicks later (but you will still feel plenty, especially if you are feeling them already at 20 weeks) and if you need a c-section done, it will be more of an emergency case as they may have to cut through the placenta to get to baby. Otherwise, there should be no issues whatsoever.
TwoXChromosomes X No, not at all. It...came from within (internal organ pain). It was what you would describe as a "dull pain" (hard to exactly pinpoint, as opposed to a sharp pain). You know when you have bad cramps and need a heating pad and to have pressure on your abdomen? It is like that, but more intense and sudden. Oh, get a heating pad if you don't already have one!
BabyBumps X Mine's anterior, and I haven't felt much difference in movement between this one and the last, and my last one was posterior.  I couldn't feel movement as early, but it hasn't been affecting my pregnancy.
BabyBumps X We've tried mutual masturbation and oral but we always end up wanting more. He says it's really hard for him when I give him oral not to have full out sex with me.
BabyBumps X Guy's Guide ot pregnancy and childbirth. Hilarious read, and also very informative. My husband loved it.
TwoXChromosomes X 1. I had very bad cramps and nausea during my periods before I got my Mirena. I've only had it for about two months now and my once heavy periods are very light. I had a small bit of cramping during my first post-Mirena period, but none after that. It is so amazing.  2. However, the insertion for me was awful. I was given some kind of painkiller and (maybe I was just being a wuss but) it hurt like hell. I also got quite sick (like, violent puking) after it on the way home from the gyn, but after a little nap and some Advil, I was okay.  3. Don't get yeast infections  4. Don't use a divacup  5. I've gained maybe 5 pounds, but it could be from me not working out as regularly as I used to.  6. Never been on Nuva Ring   I admit that it was an absolute abhorent, awful pain having it inserted. However, I kept trying to think that I got (nearly) that much pain every month for four days. I am so glad I did it and I wish I had gotten Mirena years ago!
BabyBumps X This time I found it at 8 weeks. Last time, I couldn't find it til 12 despite a lot of looking.   You don't need to worry yet! Baby is so tiny right now, those who can find it are lucky and extremely patient and have great hearing, the area it can be found in is tiny and even at the highest setting it is so faint it won't register on the sonoline as a heartbeat, you have to spot it yourself.
BabyBumps X Don't worry about the heartbeat.  My midwife couldn't find the heartbeat at my 10 week appointment and she said it's no big deal.  It's often just too early to find.
BabyBumps X I'm 15 weeks, and not one bit of morning sickness, hardly even nauseated :x. I was kind of hoping that I would get sick from cigarettes, but no such luck :\. That's awesome (aside from vomiting and feeling like crap) that you were able to quit like that! 
BabyBumps X Start apologizing to your baby everytime you have a cigarette. That's what I did, I was done in a week cause I felt so bad. And when you get to a certain point, just stop buying the cigarettes, that helps.   You can do it, I smoked a pack and a half a day when I found out I was pregnant, i had been smoking for 8 years, and like I said, I was able to quit in a week.  Keep your head up.
BabyBumps X I hated it til I got a bit into the second tri. I am sure I'll hate it again in the third lol... It's not all they say tho, that's for sure -- the hip pain and freaking bacne 8( -- but hopefully you will start enjoying it further in. :c I know some ppl are unlucky and have it really bad the entire time ._.;  
TwoXChromosomes X Your point seemed to be that there is a difference between a zygote and a sperm cell, and the implication of that point is that women should not be free to choose whether and when to carry a fetus even if men should be free to choose when and where they ejaculate.  My point is that, regardless of how you identify a zygote (as a cell or as a person), it's still a free choice issue and it doesn't matter that a zygote might be a person in somebody's eyes.
BabyBumps X I thought my first trimester woes would never end but they did :)  Keep your head up, the nausea and the metallic tastes will pass eventually.  Aches and pains are here to stay unfortunately.  Just gets lots of rest and keep your feet up :]  Congrats on your little one!
BabyBumps X Yes I definitely had that between 4 and 6 weeks. I wad worried too but had a six week ultrasound and everything was perfect and saw a heartbeat! Don't worry about it too much. I never had it, but spotting can be normal as well. 
TwoXChromosomes X What is the failure rate? Please include a source if possible. It's just that the insert that comes with my birth control boasts a &gt;99% success rate so I'm kinda surprised hearing it has a decent failure rate.
TwoXChromosomes X [Organism]( )  &gt; Scientific classification in biology considers organisms synonymous with life on Earth.  [Fertilisation]( )  &gt; Fertilisation (also known as conception, fecundation and syngamy) is the fusion of gametes to produce a new organism.
BabyBumps X I hope I'm that lucky, I'm a very "personal space" kind of girl haha. My fiance took a 15 week belly shot and he looked at it and said, "your belly button is definitely going to pop." we shall see though!
BabyBumps X That's what we've been calling the baby since we saw the first ultrasound for the big head and tiny arms... :)
TwoXChromosomes X Since it's your first month, it may just be your adjustment period.   However, when this happened to me, I ended up having to switch pills.  Sometimes it takes several tries to get it right.  Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X Just be sure to mention the wipes are NOT flushable and provide a waste bin for them. Last thing you need is backed up pipes!
TwoXChromosomes X Honestly, I would just call the doctor that prescribed the pills and ask for their advise. It's probably completely normal, but I'd check with them just so you feel safe. :)
BabyBumps X Do you by chance have a uti? Baby pressing on my bladder means I Pee more, yes.... But a uti has me constantly feeling the need and it drives me crazy. Personally, I use cranberry pills and if that doesn't fix it, then I go to my midwife for antibiotics (or that's the plan, never had cranberry pills not work)  To be sure that is what it is, AZO actually sells strips you can test for it yourself at home if you want to be sure without a visit to the doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X How did the doctor even know if you were miscarrying? Did they do a pregnancy test or an ultrasound? How did you find it? 
BabyBumps X Yeah, my kiddo has been kicking me since about the 15th week, which is nuts. At this point, it's like an earthquake or that scene in Space Balls when the alien bursts out and sings "Hello My Baby." It's crazy reassuring though!
TwoXChromosomes X Good to know, thanks!  I have AZO to relieve the pain, but last time I took it and went to the doctor, the nurse lectured me that it changes the test they do. Slap on the wrist there. But I also keep AZO brand "test strips" (I tend to have a lot of vaginal issues - I steer clear of soaps and bath products, non-cotton underwear, etc) and I just used one and it's positive.   So, I'll be putting off any pain duller until after I get my antibiotics. Oi. Only a couple more hours! ... -_-
BabyBumps X Stuck in the middle with you =) When I think of my pregnancy due date buddies, or the ladies that have been around since my start on babybumps, off the top of mind I think of you, malparty, yaen, and mudflapfeminist!
BabyBumps X If you don't decide to go this route and do wash the baby, a nice option that we did was to have in our birth plan that my husband would give the first bath and we brought our own soap. It was really lovely.  We had over an hour of skin to skin time and starting to breast feed in the delivery room post-birth. Then all three of us, with me in a wheelchair, went to the nursery where my husband did the bath while I took photos. It was a great chance for him to feel involved and have some bonding time of his own. After the bath all three of us proceeded to the postpartum room together. So we all got to stay together the entire time. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm sure there are other pro-lifers here. I'm not one of them though. With all due respect, I don't see the logic in giving a fetus a right that no other human being or entity has.   Are you for illegalizing abortions? Or are you just against them, but for keeping them safe and legal? Do you protest outside of clinics?
BabyBumps X I'm around 5'9" And when I got pregnant with my first I weighed about.. 270 ish pounds. I was fat. Like you I ate healthily. Tried to lose weight but it would never stay off and my body constantly hovered around the same weight. The pregnancy was fine. I had no issues with blood pressure or gestational diabeetes. I actually lost 30 pounds during the pregnancy all thanks to morning sickness which decided to stick around the entire pregnancy. I had a healthy 7 pound 11 ounce baby girl. Now I'm pregnant with my second. Don't listen to what doctors think is right. You listen to yourself. I know that might sound very wrong. But you and only you can know when you feel healthy enough to carry a baby.   My only issue was that I felt/looked like a beached sea cow. But I'm sure I'm not the only woman who will tell you that. 
TwoXChromosomes X ok ladies ive been wanting to try the diva cup for a long time now, but i work at a mall, our bathroom is public do you have to wash it out mid day the same as you would change a tampon? does it leak? can you feel it in there?
TwoXChromosomes X Pro-life or pro-choice, if a woman is in a situation where having a baby is not possible, she will have an abortion. The question isn't if abortions should happen or not, but how dangerous they will be for the women who have them. 
TwoXChromosomes X Well, 3 options: 1) I push it all the way in while folded before I let it inflate open. 2) You can trim the stem slightly (no more than half is recommended) if it's bugging you. 3) Of course is that your vaginal canal is too short for the model you have. It's hard to make something that fits universally on everyone who wants one, but there's a TON of different brands with different sizing methods :)
AskWomen X Irregular periods could be a symptom of a few things, so it's best to get everything checked out.   PCOS, Endemetriosis, cysts, to name a few. All are treatable, but you need to be seen just to make sure everything's okay.
BabyBumps X Is it like a creamy discharge or a mucus discharge? At the end of your pregnancy, baby and belly are both heavier and putting pressure on your vagina and vulva. This, combined with increased blood flow, will often result in a lot of creamy, lotion-y discharge.   If it is snotty, it is likely your mucous plug. If it is clear and thin, it might be your bag of waters breaking. If it is creamy, then it is likely normal discharge.   I've had a few UTIs, but none while pregnant. My non-pregnant UTIs weren't ever accompanied by increased discharge. But everyone is different, so I don't know what is "normal" for you. 
TwoXChromosomes X Chill out, just stating my opinion that you asked for.  And yes, it is killing a child. By the time a woman finds out she's pregnant there is a child growing inside her whether she wants it there or not. And to simply kill that child before it even gets a chance to live because you don't want it is cruel. I'm not trying to take away anyone's rights, I think a woman should be able to choose what she wants to do. I just don't think it's right to abort a child just because you don't want it.
TwoXChromosomes X Loooove my NuvaRing. So convenient for someone who cant remember to  take a pill everyday (me). I had headaches my first month though. Nothing so bad that a couple tylenol couldn't get rid of though. Mainly I love the way its gotten rid of my acne. I haven't tried continuously cycling yet but I think I might next month.   Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
BabyBumps X You should take the prenatal and the iron pill at different times, both about when you eat.  Iron can only be absorbed so much at a time, the rest will pass through unabsorbed, and your prenatal likely already has some iron in it.  I take my prenatal in the morning with breakfast, then the iron pill in the evening with dinner.
BabyBumps X If you have one, you can try a breast pump. The stimulation releases oxytocin and can start your labor but you have to keep at it(I have been told 15 mins every hour or more) Good luck
TwoXChromosomes X I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I feel like this argument is just arguing for the potential of human life. It *is* a cluster of cells, and currently cannot experience pain or fear... but you seem to be saying "But maybe it can eventually". I feel like if you extrapolate that logic, you then apply it to sperm even - Sperm has the 'potential' to form human life, so it's therefore wrong for guys to ever ejaculate unless it's via unprotected sex so that it has the "chance" to form a human life. I know I took this to a silly level, but does that make sense?
BabyBumps X I needed an ultrasound at 6 weeks due to bleeding, and baby was so small, like a centimeter.  Very hard to see at that point.  Even when I followed up at 7 weeks they could see much more.  I think she just needs a little time.  
BabyBumps X Maybe baby is having a growth spurt?  I was feeling mine around 17 weeks, and then he seemingly stopped moving for almost 2 weeks (18-20) before starting up again, and that is what my midwife told me.  
TwoXChromosomes X Good luck! I got my implant two years ago and it has treated me very well. The first few weeks I had it had dark, yet painless bruising on the injection sight and a long, heavy first period. After that? I sometimes forget if I even have a period at all! Once a year perhaps? Fun to play with, fun to spread the word about. Great birth control option. Very effective. 
TwoXChromosomes X Pure cranberry juice, the kind you dilute with water and cranberry pills. Apparently if you take the pills everyday it just in general keeps them away :)
TwoXChromosomes X I was told that peeing after sex also helps prevent bladder infections. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had PMDD while I was on the pill (Levora) for three years, gradually getting worse each month until I started having self-injuring/suicidal thoughts. I went to my gyno and found out that other girls were having the same issue with the same pill and got switched to a tri-phasic pill instead (Caziant). I'd talk to a gyno. Maybe birth control or even anti-depressants during that time (which was the other option they suggested) would help.
BabyBumps X I wish I was smaller, because when I'm 16 weeks I'll look much bigger... I started out with a lot of belly fat so now at 9 weeks, I look pretty much how you look. It's all belly fat, I'm def not showing yet. Not sure if I should pretend it's baby and flaunt it or wear my normal baggy clothes because it's really just fat lol
AskWomen X That most women don't experience PMDD doesn't mean they don't experience PMS.
AskWomen X  It is actually a liberating feeling to know that my reactions are caused by hormones due to the onset of a menstrual cycle. That knowledge helps me "rein it in". Otherwise I just think I'm crazy and I obsess about how terrible I apparently am, which leads to more outbursts. Not fun. Sometimes I do not realize that it is because of PMS because my periods are very irregular and I cannot track them. So, PMS hits me out of the blue, and I won't know it was PMS until I actually start bleeding a couple days later. (edited typo)
TwoXChromosomes X How many different types of BC have you tried? I've been through 6 different pills until I found one that worked. There are tons of different hormone ratios to consider.
BabyBumps X My sister-in-law was due a month before me too (with my last pregnancy). I had my baby 2 days before her! She was none-too-thrilled, as she was supposed to be induced on the exact day I went into preterm labor and delivered--and her induction was delayed two days because her hospital was too busy delivering babies. I was afraid for her to find out ;-).   It is so fun to take pics of the two of them together. I hope they have lots of fun growing up, being so close in age!
TwoXChromosomes X Maybe you should try Paraguard or something.  It sounds like the hormones are just not working out for you.  Paraguard is the copper IUD that just kills off the little suckers before they can really get to anything rather than a hormonal IUD that tricks your body into thinking it's already pregnant.  Just in case you didn't know :). 
TwoXChromosomes X I've used it for a couple years now and it's definitely the easiest BC method I've tried. Ive never had any side effects that I can remember. I use it for 4 full weeks and replace it without a gap to avoid periods. I usually end up having 1-2 light ones a year. 
TwoXChromosomes X Anecdotally: yes. Women in my family get pregnant on birth control. My mother especially warned me that I'd need to probably use at least 2 forms of BC because we have this issue.  I don't know if SCIENCE backs this up or not. But also consider most forms of BC have, was, a 1/100 failure rate? You have sex three times a week, your BC has stastically "failed" once that year. The longer you're consistently sexually active, the more likely you're going to get unlucky.  Definitely talk to your doctor about doing some kind of double-backup, like maybe a non-hormonal IUD and the patch or whatever. Good luck!
BabyBumps X Well my first sign is my breasts were sore for a week straight, which is reaaaally uncommon for me. That was the first thing that tipped me off. The next thing was the gyno, I had went because I thought I had an infection, she just said I had a lot of discharge and I was like, "Hmmm that's a little too weird..." So I asked if there was a chance I could be pregnant and told her my last period date, she said that there was a very slight chance of me being pregnant. But I took a test the next day anyway and bam. haha
BabyBumps X Re: Maternity Clothes.  So, at some point in time, in the next 5-15 weeks none of your clothes will fit.  Maternity clothes are expensive, and tend to be less than flattering.  I have been buying lots of clothes, mostly secondhand from thrift stores, Good Will and the like.  Everything I have bought has loads of stretch/elastic, lots of empire waist dresses, etc... most of it will work when I am not pregnant too.   
TwoXChromosomes X Ok so I got my IUD (Mirena) for period control because of my stupid freaking endometriosis. The first year of my first IUD was miserable because I was getting my period every other week (which for me if vomiting, pain-and-doom town) and I was 17 and woeful. But I stuck it out and now it is great. I'm on the second year of my second IUD. I spot maybe 3-4 times a year, have almost no pain (comparatively) and my man and I never have to think about birth control. The other day a friend asked if I had a tampon and I had a moment of thinking "Oh yeah, periods. They suck" because I seriously never think about it any more. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have a short vaginal canal and the strings also poked my man, so instead of trimming them, they just curled the wires up inside my cervix so the IUD could still be removed easily later.
TwoXChromosomes X A few days before mine I feel achy, depressed, and tired...then when I start I feel energetic and amazing (or maybe I'm normal again and it just feels great compared to the days before).
BabyBumps X Well you sort of have gained weight.  I mean, you definitely have.  You gained baby weight and lost excess fat at the same rate.  :) So it's not like by saying "I haven't gained any weight" means you don't have a baby belly/bump.  Your coworker isn't very bright.
BabyBump X -ak-ash4/412815_3020534789512_1146950679_32399173_595088449_n.jpg This was me 2 week ago [@ 20 weeks]. I'm 5'10 and always been really skinny [tho i've doughed up a bit since getting preg XD] So it might get big! 
BabyBumps X *hugs* I also gained way too much weight with my first. I started my pregnancy at 158 (I'm 5'7) and the day I delivered my daughter I was 234. By 6 months I didn't even look at the scale. I think some women are naturally prone to gaining more weight, but at the end of the day (unless there are medical reasons) I did it to myself. I ate everything I craved in huge quantities. Finishing a whole pint of ice cream in 1 sitting wasn't even a big deal. I used pregnancy as an excuse to eat everything and anything. It's never too late to start making healthy choices. This isn't the time to beat yourself up or to diet, but just try to be healthier for now :) You husband loves you for you and you will lose the weight when the time comes. While I gained a ton of weight, a lot of it was still baby weight. Within 7 days of giving birth I was down to 195 pounds. Don't let this ruin your last couple weeks of pregnancy. The doctor shouldn't have been rude to you like that. You are still beautiful, and after baby comes you will be able to lose the weight.  
TwoXChromosomes X Do you have a hormonal or non-hormonal one? When I got my Mirena I had a period for almost 8 weeks straight, but ever since I've just had a teeny bit of spotting one day a month... so for me, that's worth it.   I have heard that Paraguard (the copper one) makes your periods heavier and more intense the entire time, though. 
TwoXChromosomes X I got pregnant at 20 (and again at 23).  We decided to keep the baby because #1 I wasn't sure I could emotionally handle an abortion #2 we were "able" to provide (boyfriend, now husband, had a good job, I had a decent one) #3 I knew I wanted kids eventually so while that wasn't WHEN I was looking for a babe I knew I wanted one.
TwoXChromosomes X Mirena - that still has hormones but the dose is far far smaller and, from what I understand, causes far less side effect due to that and not having to travel through your digestive system.  It's supposed to stop your periods eventually, another bonus but also the reason I didn't think it was weird to miss my last period.
TwoXChromosomes X The only way I've been able to achieve vaginal orgasm is by being on top. It allows me to rub my clitoris on my SO's groin, otherwise, I will never finish. I come very, very close to orgasm with some really amazing doggy-style and missionary but it just... doesn't peak.      I also understand what you mean about your clit getting numb after a while. It happens to me, too. I feel like I have a 30 minute window, during intercourse, to cum or it will not happen. It's very frustrating.      The best advice I can give you is to be *very* wet and horny before penetrative sex and *focus, focus, focus*. Don't force yourself, don't hurry yourself, relax. Sometimes it helps to "narrate" what's going on in your head. Kind of like a porno, starring you!        Good luck!
BabyBumps X I actually don't think that was it. I had some crunchy food and the world seems good again. Didn't know it was that easy. Now if only I could sleep. You would think pregnancy would be really the most relaxing time ever to prepare you for the lack of sleep you will have after you actually have a baby. It feels like my body is trolling me. 
AskWomen X Some women wear panty-liners because they have a large quantity of normal daily discharge and they worry it could stain or damage the underwear. She could have been one of those women.   You can buy underwear with things like that built in, but they're pretty hard to find. Failing that maybe she just forgot to take out the hygienic liner or forgot to take out a pad she was wearing just in case because she was at the end of a period.   It could have been many things for many different reasons. May I ask why it (seems to have) bothered you so much, out of interest?
BabyBumps X For my first it says girl, I had a boy. It says boy this time, I'm having a girl. Still fun though. 
BabyBumps X I was only supposed to get the initial one (not even a 20 week one), though I'm uninsured and would have had to pay out of pocket, and they said they weren't wasting my money unless it was medically necessary.  I am, however, high risk and have had 4 other ones.  I don't think I'm getting any more at this point though, I'm due in a couple of weeks and I haven't been scheduled for any more since they all concluded everything was developing fine.  (:
BabyBumps X 3 so far. One at 8 weeks for dating, one at 13 weeks for nuchal translucency, one at 21 weeks for anatomy. I don't think I'll have any others unless there's a problem.
BabyBumps X The test line may never be as dark or darker than the control line, just so you are aware and don't freak out that something may be wrong. There are different amounts of dye in each box, even each test. It's a yes/no test, not a "how pregnant am i" test. In my experience with my first, it did get darker progressively, however with this pregnancy it didn't really but did show up quicker. The only true "how pregnant am i" test is a quantitative blood test that will tell you your exact hcg numbers.  Congrats and hoping for a very sticky bean for you!  PS - I love your username :)
TwoXChromosomes X i went in expecting the horror stories of pain but did not have any pain.  Just felt it go in and was done.  I didn't have any cramping or spotting after but I was coming off the pill, doc told me to continue taking it for 2 weeks till the IUD had built up enough to prevent pregnancy.  I don't know if that helped and when I stop the pills is going to be terrible still only had it a week and a half.  Cross your fingers for me.  
TwoXChromosomes X ErisHeires is right. It happens. Possible infection. If you have access to free medical, I'd go tell them you suspect you have an infection and let them tell you the best way to treat it. It's possible that an OTC can help, but not if it's anything very serious. No need dropping $ on yeast infection medication when what you really need is an antibiotic.  Sometimes these things go away on their own, but it's best not to risk it.   Also, as silly as it sounds, sometimes your diet can change things up a bit. Sometimes if I've been eating a lot of very aromatic food I can tell a faint aroma from any discharge I may have. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is correct, and it's very unlikely that we'll allow eggs grown from stem cells to be implanted any time soon. It's just too risky and there are too many ethical concerns.
BabyBumps X I had the same thing. Always in the same spot and always quite painful. Did the necessary tests and narrowed it down to round ligament pain too :) It went away for me after I started going to the pool occasionally to ease my aches. 
BabyBumps X TONS of women have experience with these, they're actually very common.   You may or may not get bleeding. Bleeding you may get can range from spotting to outright gushing complete with clots... and STILL go on to have a healthy baby. Being aware that you're already at risk of this happening should help (a little) to calm you down if it happens. You should still get in to get checked if it happens, just to be sure, but if it does it's almost certainly due to your SCH.  If your doctor is not the least bit worried about it (and is calling it small) then it would not be large enough to threaten your pregnancy and you should not worry :)
TwoXChromosomes X No, sex is. There are unwanted pregnancies that happen to married couples, too.   Gay sex is a relatively good way to avoid unwanted pregnancies, though.
BabyBumps X Weeks 5-7 have been the worse so far. I had bad bloat, nausea (thankfully not a lot of throwing up), and just felt like I was coming down with a cold the whole time and on top of that, being so damn tired.  Now I'm 12 weeks and my pregnancy is boring LOL. I get nauseous here and there if baby doesn't like what I eat but I am slowly getting my energy back, the bloat has gone away mostly since I know what to eat and what not to eat, and all is good.   So, don't worry about it too much. It will get better. :)
BabyBumps X Oy I think those last couple weeks of pregnancy are seriously the worst! Time seriously stops. I remember with my last pregnancy at 36 weeks I was 1cm dilated and just starting to soften up, I was thinking "AWESOME!" I walked every where, had plenty of sex, had tons of BH contractions, I was sure at my 40 week appointment that at least *something* changed. Nope, nada. 1cm dilated and just barely soft. It is so frustrating. *hugs*  But yay for first steps!! Now the fun really begins :p 
BabyBumps X Is it just because the baby is measuring 2 weeks the only reasons he suspects GD? or are you having any other symptoms? My daughter always measured ahead, and GD was never a concern. As MaeBeWeird said, it could be that baby just went through a growth spurt and now is going to chill at that weight for a week. But yes, as far as I know if you follow the GD guidelines it'll keep your baby from getting too big and you'll most likely be induced around 38 weeks. Also, measurements can be very wrong. My daughter was weighing in at 9.15 on the ultrasound the day before they gave me a c-section, she was born 8.6 pounds. 
BabyBumps X oh and to clarify, it was 12 hours both times between bloody show and *baby*   Between bloody show and labor i couldn't really say, 9 hours before real, active labor where I'd choose to go to the hospital if I was doing a hospital birth, though even before then I was having some contractions.
BabyBumps X With my first, I had bloody show when I woke up, so like 8-9am. I had a doctor's appointment later that day around 2:30pm and was a stretchy 3-4cm dilated (didn't feel contractions yet). I started to feel painful contractions around 12 minutes apart about 9-10pm that night. My daughter was born just past 8am the following morning. So, about 24 hours from bloody show to baby.  Good luck! It sounds like she's going to come on her own :)
TwoXChromosomes X I tend to unwrap the tampon and set it on my leg or something before I even take out the last one, just to make the gap between tampons even smaller. Sometimes though I take out the last tampon and find that my flow has slowed enough to the point where I don't feel the need to put in a new tampon and can switch to a pad, but the other one is already unwrapped. A resealable wrapper would be nice in that case.
TwoXChromosomes X "Abstinence" and condoms.    I don't want to be on birth control pills/rings/IUD because I could set a calendar by my cycle; hormonal birth control could mess with it. My periods aren't bad, so I'd rather stay away from the hormones and pills.  I don't have vaginal sex, but I still use condoms just to be safe. Condoms also protect against most STD's so that's a big plus. 
BabyBumps X 18 weeks is far enough as long as baby cooperates (but at any point it's going to be as long as baby cooperates)  I've never found out that early but I know plenty who have, it's most definitely not too early.
TwoXChromosomes X I use implanon, which , for me, is awesome.   There is no way I would remember the pill every day. It was expensive, almost 400euro in total. It lasts three years. (a lot of people can get it on insurance I believe, where I come from we pay for all BC)  When I got it first I has a spell of the crazies, nothing too bad.   Main advantages, I haven't had a period for over a year, this happens to 20% of girls who get implanon. unfortunately 10% have severe bleeding, I was on eon the very lucky ones.  I get what I call 'phantom periods' basically become very emotional and irritable every now and then, although this could be my own doing!!   I have put on a bit of weight, but only in the past 9 months, (I've has it in over a year and a half) this could be due to a change in routine, or the hormones, I'm not sure.  All in all, couldn't recommend it more, I think it's awesome!
BabyBumps X Exactly this! Fatigue was my biggest first trimester symptom. I could hardly peel myself off the couch to do anything, and I had to take a nap every day. Once I hit 12-13 weeks I started to feel much better!!
TwoXChromosomes X It doesn't specify. That is the problem. They call a zygote a person but somehow it is okay to rid your body of the zygote aka 'person' if you are using birth control. They don't even follow their logic all the way through. 
TwoXChromosomes X Bf and I use condoms.  I don't really prefer hormonal bc methods and the condoms work just fine.  If we ever need to revisit the bc issue, I'd look at non-hormonal methods first.
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with you, being pregnant and having an abortion are emotional enough as it is. Yes it is a choice, but making that choice is a hard decision. Women don't need anyone trying to shame them out of having an abortion if that is what they feel it is right for them. 
BabyBumps X 1. 25 (26 when baby's born)  2. Yes  3. Natural hospital birth attended by a midwife  4. cloth  5. Canada
BabyBumps X they are supportive and well educated in natural births. They can provide massages, help you find comfortable positions when you're laboring and help communicate your needs to your doctor.  Among other things. Some may even provide post natal care. If you have anxiety, I highly recommend a doula... and a chiropractor ;) 
TwoXChromosomes X Yup. I got so mad a little while ago because a doctor refused to test me for HSV2 because I was asymptomatic. I demanded the test because my bf tested positive and had symptoms. The doc conceded to do a general STI test - but didn't include herpes. 
BabyBumps X As anyone would tell you, it's best to consult your doctor, but I had the same thing. I was so worried about all the cramping and it was reassuring to know others experienced it too. My cramping was so bad in the beginning that I honestly thought my period was coming. I have PCOS so my periods are few and far between, and when I get them, I have severe cramping and bleeding. This is normal for me. So when I was about 4 weeks pregnant and unaware, I cramped like nobody's business. I found out around 6 weeks and the cramps didn't go away until about 12 weeks. I still have them now and then at 21 weeks, but not often. I told my female co-workers when I cramped and they scared me by suggesting I could m/c. I'd cry and worry - and for nothing. The cramping is just your uterus and surrounding ligaments stretching and getting ready for baby. Some of us ladies just have them worse than others. Hang in there and try not to worry. It's such a mind-screw when you feel like it's your period and you know you're pregnant, LOL.
BabyBumps X Well, we had an ultrasound at 12 weeks and the tech said she thought it was a boy but warned us that she really couldn't be sure. Then at our 18 week appointment we had another ultrasound that confirmed it :)
TwoXChromosomes X I have nothing against abortion when it is to save a mother's life, I think the mother should have a choice in that case. Not all people who are pro-life are pro-life to the extent that we believe *all* types of abortion should be illegal. My main concern are abortions done for purely social reasons which is ~98% of them. 
BabyBumps X All that I've heard is that as son as possible, get baby to latch and start nursing. You may have to supplement with formula at the very beginning, but pump when you can't nurse and nurse as often as you can. The very act of baby nursing will stimulate the milk. Get off formula as soon as possible. good luck! you can do this! I would also talk to a lactation consultant or your local La Leche League.
BabyBumps X It is mutilation and it should be HIS choice to cut any part off of his body. I don't care what your opinion is on this. Is is barbaric and completely unnecessary!!
BabyBumps X My boyfriend gets so uncomfortable when I poke and prod my belly, he thinks I'm squishing the baby and that he'll be born full of dents haha
BabyBumps X Hubby jokes that I must have Neo in there or something because he frequently simultaneously kicks me in the ribs pretty hard, sticks his butt out super far so my tummy is stretched to the max, punches me um down there and along my right hip (2 different places). This kid may be small, but he sure is mighty!
BabyBumps X I wasn't overweight, but not skinny pre-pregnancy either, and honestly, I wasn't obviously pregnant until like week 30.  Then it seemed like my belly just came out of nowhere, and now I look super pregnant (and kinda wish  I could have my privacy back, haha).  There's definitely a huge growth spurt in your third trimester!
BabyBumps X Perception is a big part.  My friends could tell a few days before I did that by baby bump started to show.  I kept telling them it was bloating and my pre-baby stomach was just being pushed up.  Then I looked in a mirror and felt my stomach, sure enough my uterus finally reached the bottom of my navel.  It was just hard for me to tell because my pooch covers the very top of my uterus still.  But now, even only a few days later, the pooch is starting to distribute a bit better.  My navel still looks a bit fatty, but everything below is starting to stretch and even out.
BabyBumps X My doctor and ultrasound tech have told me he is one of the most active babies. Most of the day it looks like my belly has waves. 
BabyBumps X I have a smallish bump but I still dont think I'm showing for someone who is 5 months pregnant. But I've gained 11 pounds. Where is it?!?!
BabyBumps X Just for me personally, my water broke and it took two hours before (noticeable) contractions started. But then they weren't bad until 8 hours of labor later. So, everyone is different, and it just depends.
BabyBumps X I'm 5'4" and am very short-waisted, and when I told people at work at 13 weeks, a few women said, "I knew it!" I'm not super thin, about 145 when not pregnant, but I have some muscle and carry all my extra weight in my tummy. So my tummy started to pooch out more, my boobs got noticably bigger, and it was kind of obvious to people I see on a regular basis by about 11 weeks.   I'm just over 5 months now, and I'm at the point where strangers can tell. 
BabyBumps X Aw, isn't it awesome doing it without an epidural?  I had stitches with my first (and an epi) and I swear for some reason they hurt far worse than the stitches for my third degree tear with my son (without an epi).  Congrats on the baby!
BabyBumps X be sure to tell your son you were in labor for A MONTH whenever he starts acting up. ;)  so his head was asynclitic? or is that something different? all i remember before i had to have my c-section was that the baby was asynclitic so her head wasn't dilating my cervix - they made it sound like babies simply couldn't be delivered vaginally if their head was like that.
BabyBumps X I plan to do that...in addition to telling him that he literally tore me a new one. :)  No, he just tried to push the upper-side of his head out first. He was otherwise in a normal position.
TwoXChromosomes X Besides using them for a more comfortable insertion, I think applicators help girls that are just starting out using tampons. With non-applicator tampons, you don't really have any guide as to how far you push it in, and I can see how that can frustrate girls.
BabyBumps X I was induced by amniocentesis when my daughter was 12 days overdue, and I never got any contractions after they broke my water. The monitor said I was having minor ones however, but they weren't regular and they were painless. Not nearly strong enough to do much of anything. I waited about 4 or so hours before they wanted to start me on pitocin. Then the contractions were one right after the other.   With my first my contractions were horrible the whole time, I don't remember them varying (I was induced as well but with prostaglandin gel) and my water broke about midway through labor. They didn't hurt more after, just became more frequent. 
AskWomen X &gt;Is there a reason that she couldn't plan ahead and pump for on-the-go-feedings?  Yea, because she could be jeopardizing her whole natural breastfeeding thing. If she uses a bottle on a breast fed baby, that baby may not take the breast any more.   &gt;But why is it her right to do it in public?   Because the baby's health/rights and the mother's rights are more important than someone else's awkwardness.   &gt;I'd at least try to find a quiet place.  That's your prerogative but women don't have to do that. Most times breast feeding happens, nothing shows anyway. 
TwoXChromosomes X It is also possible to wring out tampons to buy yourself a few more hours. It's not pretty, but it lasts longer and is more comfortable than makeshift tp pads.
BabyBumps X I wouldn't bother with the stool softener, since you have no idea when labor will actually start. just wait til after.   transition is the most intense part of labor, and usually the most shortlived. contractions come one after the other, with little to mo break. in normal labors though, it lasts a short time.
BabyBumps X They mean you are nearing the end... But not necessarily soon. Could still be pregnant for 7 more weeks, or have baby in 7 more days. There's no way of really knowing. 
TwoXChromosomes X Second pap test results came back negative!  Thank you for your advice and concern!  :)
TwoXChromosomes X Just so you know, virginity isn't determined by having a hymen. You are a virgin if you haven't had sex yet.  SO if you haven't had sex, you still technically are a virgin.  The idea that hymens determine virginity have been disproven for quite a while.  Here's more [info]( )
BabyBumps X Yes. The moment I found out that I was pregnant, I knew it was a boy. And I was right. :) Everyone else thought it was a girl, but I never thought so. I guess I had a pretty good chance of being right though!
BabyBumps X I cannot get comfortable at all today!!   My hips ache, my head aches, I've got stretching RLP, I've felt twinging-like cramps in areas near my left ovary, inside of my left hip, and what I assume is my cervix.   This morning when I woke up, I was convinced I could actually feel things inside of me like my stomach/intestines shifting further up into my abdominal cavity. And I was actually woken up by the pressure on my colon.   I'd say this little one is growing! 
TwoXChromosomes X actually, if you've had problems with side effects with other forms of the pill you may also get these side effects with the mirena. I have the copper IUD and my doctor said I could also try hormonal BC concurrently as it works by an entirely different method. (But of course ask your doctor.)  By the way, what type of pill are you taking? I have had problems with side effects in the past and was thinking of trying again but I'm not sure what kind.
BabyBumps X I was induced, had an epidural, it failed and I ended up with a c-section.  I wouldn't do the induction again if given the choice.  I feel my body just wasn't ready.  The epidural was amazing.  I sobbed getting it placed, suddenly finding it was scarier than I had thought.  Turned out to be super easy and would do it again.  It totally helped me stay focused.  It was turned off during pushing, which helped me feel contractions.  However, I had to push for 3 hours and the baby didn't budge.  The doctor tried suction, baby didn't move.  Heart rate started to go down, they decided to cut me open.  By that point I was begging to have the baby cut out.  The c-section was scary because it was unexpected.  It was fast paced, I was drugged up because I was a bit delirious by that point.  But it went quickly.  In the end I was too tired to breastfeed my baby that night, but I did in the morning, and it went great.  Recovery from the c-section wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.  As long as you follow the directions from the nurse on getting up and moving.  Very important.  By day 2 post delivery I was feeling pretty good.  I felt no side effects from any medications.  Aside from the induction I would do it all again.  This fall when #2 is born I'm going to have another c-section.  I took in the info about VBAC and decided it's just not for me.  Good luck with your delivery!!
TwoXChromosomes X I third this! Playtex is the only kind I can use (cardboard applicators can suck it) and the Playtex sport is the most comfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X So you only had one surgery, and it helped you? I had my first done about five months ago, and it helped the pain for about a month but now it's back..he actually only removed a few spots of endo and a cyst, and they think that my pelvic muscles are way tense which is causing a lot of the pelvic pain, but some of the pain that I have really feels like endo.
BabyBumps X Did you see the ultrasound when they told you it was a boy?  When they told me it was like, yep...boy!  I could see his balls, heh.  And then we had a 3d ultrasound later anyway, so we got to see a 3d penis.  None of my predictions were wrong, but maybe you can have a 3d ultrasound?  It'll be pretty clear on there.
BabyBumps X I have 7 down votes for a baby bump picture!? That's weird!  This is my second pregnancy. And I've popped out a lot this past week.  Thanks for all the compliments! 
BabyBumps X For several days I had my friends telling me I had a baby bump but it just felt like bloating to me because it happened so suddenly. Having an orgasm will let you know where your uterus is.  I tried after I got my baby bump and my whole lower abdomen was spasming.  It was a weird feeling to say in the least, but it confirmed my uterus was up to my navel. My mom had a very big baby bump at 10 weeks, about the size of yours.  She looked further along than a friend who was 4 months, so it is definitely possible to show that early.  It took me until just before week 16 to look like she did at 10 weeks, so comparing to even family members doesn't always work.  Women just start showing at different times.
TwoXChromosomes X My point is, ladypossum seemed surprised that female genital mutilation gets more attention than male genital mutilation. That's not surprising at all when female genital mutilation is considerably more (not just "little", as men generally retain normal sexual function after the procedure) destructive.
AskWomen X Cycling the pill like this is totally ok and pretty common. The period you get while on the placebo week is just withdrawal bleeding so skipping it is not harmful. You may have some spotting the first one or two times while your body adjusts and you may want to keep a couple of pregnancy tests on hand if you cycle the pill for more than a couple of months at a time. 
BabyBumps X I was induced and...not gonna lie...it was awful. Pitocin is nothing to mess around with. Contractions are much stronger than "natural" ones and there was no break in between them. It was like one big constant contraction. Oh and my uterus ruptured. The doctor blamed pitocin for that too. I'm doing every thing I can to NOT have to have that crap in me again. 
BabyBumps X The pops were like popcorn popping, kind of like gas bubbles passing through but stronger, more defined, and stayed in one spot.
TwoXChromosomes X Drink lots of water. This is related to th peein after sex - urine is sterile, and when I had a UTI my doctor told me to drink tons of water to help flush out my system! Plus, if you don't have any symptoms of a UTI it won't hurt as much to pee all the time. XD   When I had my first UTI, my mom told me not to tell anyone because "they'll know how you got it" (that is, sex). So incase anyone ever tells you something like that, fuck 'em. UTIs are normal and nothing to be ashamed of! 
BabyBumps X That was the same with me! Everyone thought boy, especially by the way I was carrying. Even I was surprised when they announced it was a girl at the birth. :)
BabyBumps X You can ask for the nuchal translucency scan at 12-14 weeks and that will date you. It's a genetic screen but I did have to ask for it (and ended up not getting it because of the timing and holidays)
TwoXChromosomes X She should defintely go into a clinic where its walk in. it can develop into a kidney infection but that usually takes some time (I've had a couple of kidney infections that didnt have the normal bladder infection symptoms and i ended up in the hospital with em' and I can tell you, not so much with the funness, more with the extreme pain)  but this is something that wont go away on its own and she will need antibiotics.
BabyBumps X I passed clots and a lot of blood at six weeks and it has all resolved.  Good luck!
BabyBumps X That sounds a LOT like when I had a kidney stone whilst pregnant last time! Drink tons of water, and call your doctor ASAP.  It only gets worse.
BabyBumps X It's not a common option, but when I was looking at induction with #1 (I was due to be induced at 12ish days over, I went into labour at 11 days over) I was going with the [foley catheter method]( ). It's only good if you are less than 3cm dilated since it basically ripens the cervix to make you more favourable for other methods.
BabyBumps X That's pretty much my only catch point here. I see that induction IS necessary at some point, and my doc is firm on the 10 days being optimal... but part of me wonders if I should wait a little longer if it comes to that. My mom was three weeks overdue with my sister and she turned out okay. I know several women that were induced several times and didn't end up with emerg c sections... everyone is just so different! It's a tough choice to make, honestly. I tend to go with whatever the doctors say but this is the ONE thing I keep wondering about... lots fo good stories on here to read through!!!
BabyBumps X As far as I know, none of the stuff at Target or Old Navy comes in plus sizes, but Motherhood carries plus sizes in some (but not all) of their stores.  They aren't *that* expensive, especially if you buy stuff on sale.  It seems like every week or two something different is on sale.  Some of it is kind of frumpy, but you can get some decent basics there.
BabyBumps X Congrats! Glad you found out now rather than on her birthday. ;)   I found out I was having a boy at 16 weeks. I just went with it, but recently during an ultrasound the tech asked if we knew, or if it was a surprise. I said we knew it was a boy, unless it was a girl - that would be a surprise. She double-checked. Still a boy. :)
BabyBumps X Bwahaha, yeah, I know I shouldn't complain because I lucked out until now.  At least in a couple of weeks, I can start going back to normal!  I'm sure the fact that I can finally eat like somewhat of a normal person (I had really bad morning sickness, and it still has not completely gone away) has not helped because I've definitely indulged almost every chance I've gotten.  xD
BabyBumps X Oh, I totally understand about the worrying.  I was just reminding people that it doesn't mean their baby actually has the condition.  Most of the time the baby is fine.  Also, FYI, the blood tests compare your hormonal levels to an average 35 year old.  So if you're, say, 40, there's an almost 50% chance your screening test will come back positive.  Well, "positive".
TwoXChromosomes X Haha, I have the same scars from a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy (had fallopian tubes removed). YAY LAP SURGERIES.
BabyBumps X Oh and you'll love the women who say they were never sick their whole pregnancies. I wasn't supposed to be able to conceive, so when I started puking up literally everything I ate, I assumed it was the flu... until I finally backed down and took a test. Even though I puked up everything the first 10 weeks or so, I still felt queasy all through the day. I'm 22 weeks and I *still* feel queasy. Random things still make me puke, such as popcorn (?!). It's not all in your head. Tell 'em to shove it ;) it's morning sickness! or all-day/all-night sickness, haha.
BabyBumps X Are you hoping for one over the other? Or is you S/O or family hoping for one over the other. I am only 12 weeks and my S/O and MIL said that it is a girl, when I try to tell them it maybe a boy they just say, nope it is a girl. 
BabyBumps X I keep wondering if i'm showing or whether i'm just bloated too. &gt;.&lt; Everyone keeps telling me that they see a bump but I don't. I'm like no...i'm just as big as I always was. Idk what you are seeing. 
BabyBumps X I feel you on the blood issues. I have O- blood and my husband is O+ and I tested positive for Rhesus Antibody D which among other complications can cause miscarriage early on and later on cause the baby to need transfusions (among other things). So far though, I am 23 weeks pregnant with a healthy boy and my antibody levels have stayed extremely low to the point that no intervention has been needed. In the future, it might be harder to make it to that 2nd trimester mark but it's entirely possible. I don't know if you have the Rhesus antibodies or not, but like myself, it may be harder for us to have children, but it's not impossible - especially with modern medicine.   Have as good of a honeymoon as you can!
BabyBumps X It's miserable! I didn't think anything could be as bad as morning sickness but only 6 hrs of sleep in over 48 hrs is proving otherwise. Hope we both find some relief soon!
AskWomen X I was on Loestrin24Fe for about a year but at my February yearly gyno appointment, I asked my doctor about a pill to give me less periods because mine, like yours, were *brutal.* He switched me to Lo Loestrin Fe and I haven't had a period since! It's AWESOME. I've also noticed that I am not as emotional as I was on L24Fe. Don't get me wrong - For about the first month, I was super sensitive to everything anyone said to me. But since then, I've been fine. My sex drive is sky high as always - but I don't think ANYTHING could kill my libido! Haha. I have not gained any weight since starting this pill.  Hope this helps! [](/happy)
BabyBumps X I can tell when she somersaults, this definitely doesn't feel like that.  It feels like she might be having a muscle spasm (or me having muscle spasms when she kicks).  It feels like vibrations.
BabyBumps X You can do it! Don't fear labor, it's a natural, wonderful process!
Parenting X My son was born 6 weeks premature(we don't know why) and he spent 23 days in the NICU.    Tomorrow will be his 1st birthday and people are shocked to find out that he was early because he is so big(my wife saw this and said that he is not SO big, I think he is when I hold him because he is 21.5lbs).
BabyBumps X Belly started growing out first...started to notice it around 12 weeks. I started to feel flutters around 17 weeks. Now I'm feeling stronger movements and the belly is getting bigger! 
Parenting X How cute! She looks great! My first son, who was actually two weeks over his due date, spent a week in the NICU (I had a really rough, long labor, so I can totally relate!). 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;it was the first thing that came to my mind when I found out (which I feel horrible about).  Absolutely don't feel guilty for thinking of abortion first or being "selfish."  You're being incredibly smart to consider what seems like is best for all involved.  It's not selfish to decide that you aren't financially ready for a child now, you're making the decision that when you do have a child, you want it to be the best situation possible for your child and you and your fiance.  It seems like your fiance is supportive and it's definitely good that he's planning to come with you.  I don't have any specific advice, but take comfort in the fact that you are making the right decision.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not anti-pms.   I'm pro-science.   Please note that PMS is not the same as PMDD.
TwoXChromosomes X The purpose of the hypothetical situation is to put you in my shoes to help you understand why I was so upset. EDIT- Not to debate a woman's right to choose.  There was no meaningful difference between the experiment and what I went through.  She knew we were pregnant before I did. She had the ability to terminate the pregnancy without my knowlege or concent and without disturbing my body in anyway, it was completely painless for me.  In fact, I didn't feel a thing. :)  My point is that even if the decision ultimately rests with her, which I concede that it does. It was for me, a **HORRIBLY** unethical and traumatic situation.
BabyBumps X belly came first, but it was mostly bloating.  but i felt the movement very early, around 15 weeks.  a little after movement i got a noticeable baby bump that was for sure not bloating. 
BabyBumps X Remember my story with my third?  Not engaged, no dilation, no effacement... Went into labor naturally and had her less than 24 hours later.  It happens all the time. Don't get hung up on numbers that honestly have no meaning!
TwoXChromosomes X What if science allowed for viability at day at conception? Would it still be the mother's right to decide to abort?
BabyBumps X Baby. I started feeling the babe around 15 weeks, very faint flutters. I am a day shy of 17 weeks and this babe just won't settle down now. I'm still barely showing but the movements are very noticeable (feels like pushing and twitches). Right now it's the only thing reminding me that I'm pregnant.
BabyBumps X Ooh I wish you the best of luck! I'm pregnant again and my little one is currently just 9 months old! But I know we are ready. I had implantation bleeding when I was supposed to get my period so of course I thought nothing of the blood! Then my period didn't full-on show up and I started having pregnancy symptoms. Our little surprise :3
BabyBumps X I was 2 cm dilated when my water broke.  8.5 hours later, baby was here.  My sister wasn't dilated much at 41.5 weeks.  They swept her membranes that morning, and she had the baby that evening.    Your baby will be here soon!
Parenting X congrats!!! I know its not easy to keep it under wraps. We had to tell close friends and family early(I was showing at 6-7 weeks) but waited to announce it to the world until I was almost 15 weeks along. Have a happy and healthy 9 months!!!
BabyBumps X You have no clue how the rest of the pregnancy or new motherhood will affect you. My vote is wait for baby to be old enough for you to be in a good, comfortable routine and decide then whether or not you want to add a dog to it.
TwoXChromosomes X I have chronic yeast. and have prescribed both diflucan and boric acid many times. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about the burn besides some vagisil. The diflucan should start to really work after 24hrs. Hang in there mama! It'll get better. You should be fine by next week, just take all your meds in full. And don't have sex until they're all done! It can come back, which sucks. 
AskWomen X A few thoughts:  You may be sensitive or allergic to something. Latex sensitivity can cause both; food intolerances (gluten, yeast, sugar, and dairy especially) can also cause frequent infections. What's your diet like?   Systemic antibiotics probably aren't helping. I went through a cycle for years where I'd get vaginosis, then a yeast infection, then vaginosis, rinse, repeat. I eventually tossed out the pills and started douching with vinegar/water with a few drops of tea tree oil when it happened. Soothed the itching and burning, and got rid of both infections. Now I use garlic as a vaginal suppository on the rare occasions when I get an infection. Put it in before bed, pull it out in the morning - works better than the OTC stuff from the drug store.   Also: cranberry juice! Sure, it's great for UTIs, but it can also help encourage proper PH in your bits. 
TwoXChromosomes X Sweet deal! If it doesn't work for you (i.e., bad side effects), go back and ask to try another. There are so many different ones. Don't give up on birth control pills just because one affects you badly.
TwoXChromosomes X Except they always ignore or trivialize the fact that a fetus is inside of an individual person, while a baby is biologically independent from any one individual.  
TwoXChromosomes X The miscommunication must have come from the word "viability".  Viability just means there is a 50% chance of survival out of the womb, it did nothing to address the process of extracting the fetus.  But it seems that your hypothetical assumes the safety for the woman is there, which was really my only point of contention.  At the end of the day I think we agree, that the woman's right is to remove the fetus from her in the safest way possible, not the right to determine the life status of the fetus.  Whether anyone can or should be allowed to end the life of a fetus in this hypothetical is another discussion entirely, which is one of a lot of moral ambiguity.  If we did decide to allow termination of a fetus at that point I would say it would require both parents, not just the mother.
BabyBumps X Hahaha one of my favourite things so far is not having to be self conscious about my belly! I am pretty small but put on a little bit of extra weight before I got pregnant, and had a teeny little belly bulge. Apparently it wasn't noticeable, but I HATED IT. So much. To the point of tears. Well my new baby bump has given me all the confidence in the world to stick that gut right out there. I love how big and round and obvious it is. Now, I am giving birth soon and no doubt I won't love the getting belly BACK to flat part- but for now, I enjoy it!!!!!
TwoXChromosomes X Same here, but I still feel like a freak trying to manage my flow. I can fill my cup and soak through a super absorbent cloth pad and onto my sheets every cycle. And I have to plan going out in public so that I know I will have regular access to a latrine. Being on hormonal birth control helped, but it was making me crazy and sick, so I switched to a Paragard. I keep hoping that I just need more practice and eventually I'll get this all figured out. 
TwoXChromosomes X I use panty liners all the time. I use them combined with a Mooncup when on my period. I also use them when I'm around the time of ovulation and just for the sake of not ruining my underwear right away. I don't know if it's hormones or what but for the past 8 months or so my ladyparts have just been keeping themselves well lubricated all the time and I don't appreciate having my pants soaked after a few hours, so panty liners it is.
BabyBumps X My coworker patted my belly the other day and commented on my bump.  I looked at her awkwardly and said, that's my fat belly and I've had that.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Why would it be relevant? Because abortion is removing a fetus from your body, the result is death to the fetus because we have no other way to safely remove it from a woman's body.   This is not really true since we can actually, to a certain extent do that, in the later stages of development. And as technology progresses we'll be able to do it sooner and sooner. (And as a side note, even if we get to the point where we could do it in the very beginnings during, say the, blastocyst phase, I'd still be in favour of choice, anyway going on a tangent here).    Regardless I don't see that as good argument. Yes it is a morula/blastocyst/embryo/fetus in your body? So what. We are all constrained to that which we can do with our bodies, because of the rights of others.    &gt; Neglecting or killing a baby means foregoing available opportunities to remove the child from your responsibility/body/life.  And so does killing a fetus. I don't see much of a difference.   &gt; It's not a baby inside you, it's a fetus. I'll ignore the philosophical debate of when we begin existing as "persons" and what rights we deserve at each stage of life/consciousness.   I do find that to be the most important (and most complicated) piece of the puzzle though. And that is precisely why I personally think it is fine to perform an abortion soon enough (whatever soon enough may be).   &gt; The conflict does exist inside the womb, we don't grant any life rights to another's body, and we have no way to keep the fetus alive while safely removing it from the woman.  Again I don't see why you say this. Technically it's called a fetus when it is inside your womb, it's doesn't magically transform the minute it comes out. It would be fine if you did it the previous day, previous week, possibly the previous month, and we're actually getting better at it.   In any case, when you say,   &gt; we don't grant any life rights to another's body  This is also wrong. This may be your position, that we shouldn't. But that is the discussion. And if anything the consensus would be that we actually do, as evidenced by the current laws in most countries. 
BabyBumps X I'm assuming you meant that your ultrasound was April 3rd.  Four weeks is a big difference.  There is a margin of error in ultrasound measurements.  *Taken from: -ultrasound-machine-determine-age-pregnancy/#ixzz1t9ejTfyi* &gt;Dr. Marjorie Greenfield, on the Dr. Spock website, notes that the first trimester ultrasounds are most accurate for dating the age of the pregnancy, and are typically accurate within a week of actual age. Ultrasounds taken in the second trimester are accurate to within two weeks, due to the individual growth of each baby. Third trimester ultrasounds are the least accurate as each baby grows at its own pace; they can be accurate only within a three-week range.   You'll get another full set of measurements done in just 12 days.  Having another data set should be helpful in determining if your baby is growing at the expected rate.  As long as you are eating when you're hungry I highly doubt that you're doing anything wrong.  *edited to fix formatting
BabyBumps X While 4 weeks is a big change, I wouldn't be worried about it if the doctor isn't. If they didn't do an ultrasound to figure out how far along you are, just by your LMP it could be off. Babies grow at different paces also after 12 weeks, it really doesn't have too much to do with your nutrition. As long as you're eating a fairly normal diet it's not going to change the baby much. I would see what happens at your 20 week scan in 2 weeks and see what happens then :) I had my due date changed the opposite way with my last pregnancy, I thought I was 4 weeks earlier then I was (mistook implantation bleeding for a period). My original due date was in September, then changed to end of August, and by 20 weeks they changed it to Aug. 15th. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Something like 99% of abortions happen within the first 20 weeks. The rare abortions that happen later term are usually safer to terminate the fetus before extraction. Sure we can save the fetus sometimes, but the possibility to save the fetus usually comes with increased health risks to the mother. This is just a red herring.  Sure they do. But we were discussing the grounds one which abortion could be acceptable. If these are simply the fetus being dependent on your body then this would be claiming it to be perfectly fine to do it much later.     &gt; &gt; We are all constrained to that which we can do with our bodies, because of the rights of others.  &gt; Not really, we are constrained from infringing upon other's rights, and the fetus was never given permission to use the woman's uterus and is constrained from infringing on her rights.  That is really not how it works. Sometimes there are conflicts between the rights of different people. You're simply assuming your conclusion in your argument. The discussion is precisely about whether embryos/fetus do have rights too, and when and which. And if so how to solve the conflict between their rights and the women's.    &gt; &gt; And so does killing a fetus. I don't see much of a difference.  &gt; Then you are being willfully ignorant of the rights of the woman involved. It's about bodily autonomy. It's not realistic alternative to control a woman's body by forcing her to carry out a pregnancy. It is realistic to demand a woman hand a child over to society (i.e. adoption) rather than ignoring it.  No I am not. Again that women do have rights is never a question. The question is whether the fetus also has rights and how to solve the conflict.   &gt; &gt;  Again I don't see why you say this. Technically it's called a fetus when it is inside your womb, it's doesn't magically transform the minute it comes out. It would be fine if you did it the previous day, previous week, possibly the previous month, and we're actually getting better at it.  &gt; The reason you don't see why I say this is most likely because you are a product of society that has a long history of misogyny   No the reason why I say this is because it's basic biology.   Sorry but this kills the discussion for me. Done. 
AskWomen X *When done properly*, the pull out method is more effective than condoms. It is certainly not a recommended method, but it works for some couples.
BabyBumps X You can't plan a labor, so the term "birth plan" is misleading.   When you make choices about what you would like to happen during your labor and delivery, you should be researching all your options and deciding what would be best for you in *every* possible situation. You should research about induction procedures, natural birth procedures, and section procedures.   Having an assertive birth partner (your husband) to state clearly to the nurses that you do not want to be offered pain meds, rather you will ask for them if you want them. Asking questions like "Is this an emergency?" "Can we wait?" etc.   Ultimately, you can't plan what's going to happen. So educate yourself, ask questions and be sure to talk through all your concerns with your husband and your doctor before labor. If you'd like to go natural, prepare yourself. But keep an open mind to all the options. The women that go into the hospital with a plan of how their labor will go without an open mind are more likely to need interventions.   Good luck!
BabyBumps X With contractions you get hard, like your abdomen is tightening up.  Round ligament pain, for me, is just a sharp shooting pain usually one one side but sometimes both. It is always when I stand too fast or stretch those muscles too quickly.  Gas pain is, again for me, usually high up on the tummy and very sharp. Pushing on my tummy makes it worse.
BabyBumps X Happened to me with this pregnancy. I am extremely irregular because of PCOS and I tried to tell them not to mark a due date by my last period but they didn't listen and sure enough we went in for our first heartbeat checkup and there wasn't a heart!
BabyBumps X We are so fortunate here. Socialized healthcare is amazing! The first 6 months of leave is maternity leave for the mum and the second 6 months is called Parental Leave so the mum or dad may take that time. It's pretty cool we have those options. I believe it's difficult for Americans to immigrate here unless you have a job offer.  
BabyBumps X $3250  Homebirth with midwife, covers everything except $75 birth kit.  "Everything" being all prenatal appointments, the birth, and all postnatal care.
TwoXChromosomes X Came here to say this. While this bill has it's own set of problems (no one besides my doctor should be determining the gestational age of my fetus thank you), it undermines our cause when we spread false information. Thank you for pointing this out!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;ANY kind of emotional OR financial support from my family  I'm sorry hon. &lt;&lt;&lt;hug&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes family isn't so much about blood as it is about positive people that truly care about us.
BabyBumps X Sounds like my super early labor with #2!  She came 8 1/2 hours after that pink. But I was very uncomfortable with a lower backache and having mostly painless contractions for hours at the beginning.  Between pink and "hospital time, I think... Maybe" was 5 hours even... And I was questioning if it was really labor still at that point and she came 3 1/2 hours later...  I wish you a similar experience... It was not terrible at all!  Good luck and keep us posted :) 
BabyBumps X I friend of mine had a baby this week at the hospital I am going to and the midwives asked her if she had a birthplan, she said no. They audibly sighed a breath of relief, they said they have a lot of women who come in with plans written up and dont want advice and have heard horror stories about doctors and midwives and then put themselves and their babies at unnecessary risks thinking a doctor is pressuring them for the sake of pressuring them. The nurses explained that the only person with a birth plan is the baby - it is in total control.   I do not plan on having a birthplan. Every one I know who has had one has been disappointed and thinks their birth was a failure when things didn't go according to plan. Birthing is like white water rapids. You can have an ideal path in your mind but you realistically have very little control over what will eventuate.   I plan on going in to a hospital and leaving with a healthy infant, no matter what it takes.  
TwoXChromosomes X The other thing to remember is that if you have sex with someone you don't/didn't marry, any of his future partners will be at risk, too. So even though you don't know all those women, they should have the ability to make informed decisions and not put themselves at risk because your partner didn't know.  Does that make sense?  Besides, do condoms prevent the spread of HPV? If so, I wouldn't worry over this. Just tell your partners that you tested positive, but that using a condom will protect them.
TwoXChromosomes X I had to change pills multiple times due to side effects. Some weren't strong enough so I had breakthrough bleeding, one I'm pretty sure caused me to have gallbladder issues, and now I have to be on a specific one to prevent hormonal migraines.   I agree it should be much more available, but there are DEFINITE benefits to talking to a doctor about which pill is best for you. I also have had several friends get pregnant while on low dose pills because they weren't right for them.
Parenting X This is what I thought as well. It bugs me when I read tips saying labor will take a long time and you won't have to rush to the hospital.   Everyone of my husband's colleagues told him this and that I was over reacting when I wouldn't let him travel after 37 weeks. Baby came early, I had a VERY quick onset of labor, which was also very short.  All labors are definitely not the same. 
BabyBumps X April 20th mamas! There's a few of us on here that are overdue right now. It's like a race! Hahaha. I haven't been checked for progress once yet, so I have no idea what's going on down there. I have a doc appointment tomorrow though. And after the bloody show, I am kind of excited!!!  I honestly truly didn't want the baby to arrive before today so I haven't been doing much to facilitate labour. It just didn't feel.... right. Until today. I can't stop grinning and it seems like I can't think of anything I still need to get ready for the little one. I got to spend all week eating at my favourite restaurants and nesting. I feel like letting go of the stress is what started things moving today :) Stay positive!!!! Every day baby is in there is a day she gets more nutrients and gets healthier (assuming she isn't under stress).   I am sure we'll all see our little ones soon. EEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X The only thing I would change is to make his pubic hair a bit shorter, I know it's not the penis but I like his size as is. I think his penis size is slightly larger than average but not crazy big.   He has a small soft penis and I find it hilarious as it looks like an ant eater with his foreskin over it. 
BabyBumps X Due dates aren't meant to be exact days of when you're going into labor, it's just an estimated time +/- 2 weeks, so usually they aren't right at actually predicting when you're going to go into labor. Anywhere from 37-42 weeks is full term and your baby is right on time. Earliest ultrasounds (specifically done before 12 weeks) are the most accurate ones. I did have my due date changed three times though with my first. What are they saying your due date is? 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I trim my vulva as well. I just hated shaving and the uncomfortable feeling afterwards. And my hair is pretty contained anyway, so it's not a huge problem. I kinda like how it balances out my head hair. This is probably me speaking as an artist, though.  And for those with menstrual woes, try menstrual cups! They're economical (5 years a cup!), more environmentally-friendly, and you don't have to wear diapers/remember to change a tampon every two hours.
BabyBumps X Passing clots is pretty normal. I passed one the size if a lemon with my first and kind of freaked about it. But I don't know about passing really big ones 3 weeks PP. Bleeding is still very normal, though it should be tapered off a lot by now. I think I bled for like 4 weeks with my first but the last week was brownish old stuff like you get at the end of your period. It's always good to call the doctor if you have concerns. Just try to take it easy for a few days and drink a lot of water (I swear my doctor tells me that for every complaint I have so there must be something to it!).
BabyBumps X Congrats and best wishes for the journey ahead!  I just read a really inspiring [article]( -preemie-adventure-jennifer/)  about a baby born at 24 weeks.  May your boy grow big and strong!
BabyBumps X They have [newer underwear shaped depends]( -great-american-try-on/explore-our-new-products) which are good, absorbant and comfortable.   I've done throw-away panties and huge overnight pads... it was such a mess. I've done depends, it was much more comfy and almost no mess comparatively.  You should only need that much coverage for the first few days, then you can go to having just your panties with pads. My last I was done bleeding completely before a week was up (but even if that happens, wear pads or pantyliners for another week because if you overdo it for a day, bleeding will start back up.)
BabyBumps X I'm 29 weeks and still have a bit of trouble "connecting" to this pregnancy.  But I'm so busy with my older kids, I have NOWHERE near as much time to just lay and enjoy baby kicks as I did with my first.
BabyBumps X Oh boy. =( well I hope for your sake if the morning sickness sticks that it only stays for the first trimester. My morning sickness stayed the whole pregnancy with my daughter. =(
TwoXChromosomes X Legal definition of personhood does not need to change to regulate late termination, but that's besides the new point...  &gt; If at 20 weeks your fetus doesn't need to be connected to you to survive, it becomes a human. You can't kill it, endanger it etc.  Does it violate personal autonomy? Not to me. You are free to disconnect it from your body at any time (hence it needing to be viable to be considered a person) and it will continue existing on it's own.   Viability is not some hard black and white line.  It's simply a probability of survival with existing medical technology based on other fetus' born at that time of development.  It's a sliding scale, unique to individual cases, not a binary switch.  Furthermore, there is no procedure that makes it safer for the woman to extract late term fetus alive than to terminate it first.  So your stance on autonomy doesn't follow since you would be forcing the woman to accept a higher risk in order to attempt to develop the fetus further out of womb.  I'm generally for law staying out of this because it's such a personal medical issue, and not something that law is going to be able to get right.  
BabyBumps X Slippers, a robe, your own shampoo and conditioner, and an outfit to go home in.  For baby, an outfit to go home in.  I wore my gown the whole time (bleeding the whole time), and little guy was in a diaper and hospital onesie.  The less you need to bring to and from, the better.
BabyBumps X I got mine tested at 10 weeks.  They just said as I reached 30 weeks or so they'd check again to make sure they didn't go higher.  My sister's was high during her pregnancy too.  You'd think they'd wouldn't be worried if it happened to a lot of women.  Hopefully it's nothing.  I don't want to turn high risk because of that.  I'm fine otherwise.  Maybe I was fighting off a cold?  I don't get sick much.
BabyBumps X Here's the list we got in our prepared childbirth class:  * Two or more bed pillows from home - try not to use white pillow cases so they don't get mixed up with hospital pillows or left at the hospital  * Music that is soothing to you  * Cards, books, videos, , reading material, writing material, or any other time-passers  * Several pair of thick, warm socks  * Focal point  * Hand held massager  * Digital camera  * Toiletries for you and your support person - this includes: unscented lotion, toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant (again, for you and your support person)  * Slippers and a bathrobe  * Change of clothes for your support person  * Going home clothes for mom and baby  * Change for vending machines  * Watch or clock with second hand  * Hand fan  * Lip balm  * Bra and panties  * Phone charger  * An extra bag in your bag to put dirty clothes in so it's easier to keep track of everything.   Ninja edit: Keep in mind, a lot of these things would be available on a smart phone or iTouch or something like that - the camera, the stop watch, the music. My hospital has free wifi throughout, so I'll be taking my smart phone and Kindle Fire for the reading materials. But, then you will need to remember the phone/tablet charger.  
BabyBumps X I'm going baby crazy. I feel like crying every time I see another baby. I want him here so bad. Also before I got pregnant I didn't want kids, it blows my mind how much I want him here. I feel like I'm never going to get  to that 40 week mark. I'm ready to be a mommy!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;It needs to be destructive if it is beneficial to the mother's health.  What? No, no it does not.   &gt;I will never accept your law, and I disagree with your absurd premise that a 50% probability of survival is some ultimate human right to be protected against destruction. In the morality debate of human morality, a fetus has never existed, and the potential to exist is not a barometer for morality, not one that I am willing to accept.  Yea, but crossing through the 4 inch flesh barrier that is the human woman, that's a non-arbitrary point. Simple logic, I can see two entities, they must now be labelled as such....  &gt;another life should not have rights to your body.  And no human has the innate right to destroy another life. On this we probably agree. I say separate yourself from it all you want, just don't intentionally cause it's destruction. 
BabyBumps X Your hormones change a lot while pregnant and afterwards as well. Sometimes they'll even back out to what you were used to before in a few months post-birth, but often your body just changes permanently. But don't worry, at 5 weeks, you've still got another month or two to go before your hormones are even slightly leveled out just from pregnancy.
BabyBumps X [Oh hey]( ) -  26 weeks, but 30lb weight gain - yikes! I think it's mostly baby and boobs though.
TwoXChromosomes X Monistat is the over-the-counter treatment for vaginal yeast/thrush.  It used to be prescription only but thank goodness that is no longer the case.  It definitely works.  In the meantime protect your bits from the stinging with A&amp;D ointment (in the baby aisle) applied every time you pee.  The best home remedy to keep it in check is boric acid powder (from the drug store in the first aid section) put into gelatin capsules (you get those at the health food store).  Stick one up where the tampons go every night.  The gelatin dissolves with body heat and releases the small amount of boric acid powder.  It does wonders to prevent yeast infections.  Sounds like you might want to spring for the Monistat at this point - just read the package directions.  
BabyBumps X I have a friend who never was comfortable with the idea of vaginal delivery and she was delighted when her baby was breach and she had to have a c-section. She had easy recoveries and looks back on her births with lots of fondness.  Personally, I'm aiming for a 100% natural birth because with education, good nutrition and exercise, a natural birth can be a very low-stress, quick-recovery way to have a baby. Women who give birth naturally (meaning drug free and vaginally) often report an intense period of euphoria after giving birth and a lot of personal satisfaction.This sounds ideal to me. I also have some secondary health issues when I wish to avoid any type of damage to my abdominal wall.   When it comes to birth, a good birth night be the birth the mother is more comfortable with. If your wife is frightened of childbirth and will fight her body instead of relaxing and working with her body to deliver the baby, a vaginal birth might not be the best choice.   I'd be interested in any data you could provide of the potential risks of natural childbirth seeming to outweigh the potential risks of a C-section because this doesn't line up with the data I've seen.
Parenting X Enjoy every second, the newborn phase goes by too fast. You'll have many sleepless nights so try hard to remember that you will sleep well at night again very soon but your baby will be a baby for what will feel like the blink of an eye in retrospect.
TwoXChromosomes X *hugs* Of course! I'll bet you'll get there, too! It really only took us maybe 6-9 months to get to where he rarely has trouble. Just remember to RELAX. Instead of focusing on how you have to have an orgasm, focus on how good every little thing feels, and just let yourself get enveloped in le sexxy time.  I should add that when I say husband's orgasms get stronger, I mean, holy shit. His enter body gets into it and he loses it. Like, it's like a lady-orgasm. Sometimes I think he's are stronger than mine, too!!  Have fun ;)
BabyBumps X Its normal, your entire downstairs is going to feel sore/bruised until you give birth. It confused me as well, the area is under a lot of pressure, your hips are moving to accommodate the passing of the baby, and of course, that area is FULL of extra blood.   I always likened the feeling to "after a night of amazing and rough sex, just without the fun" sitting on hard chairs hurt
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I'd never ever heard of it until I started hanging around TwoX!   I'm American, and it's the same way.  I've mentioned it to ~10 close friends IRL, but talking about periods in public isn't that acceptable.  Now that I've been using the cup for a few years, I don't go down the period isle anymore, so I don't know if the cups are carried in stores.  Considering that they are reusable, I don't imagine cups would fly off the shelves, and store make a better profit on disposable tampons/pads.    As far as horror stories, I have minor stories. The cup occasionally leaks for me while I'm sleeping.  However, leaks haven't gotten past my underwear (and I wear black undies just in case).  Even when there's a leak, the cup still holds back some of the flood waters.  When tampons or pads leaked on me, it was always a major disaster.  I think leaks happen if you don't properly clean out the 4 little holes at the top that are required for a perfect seal.  I can't tell if the seal has been formed, but it usually is.  I haven't figured out a way to check it.    But obvious pros: cleaner ladybits, cheaper &amp; less trash, convenient for travel (especially for long travels... no need to pack months of tampons or trust that you will find the right product in a different country), less hatred of sharkweek.  
BabyBumps X I have hip dysplasia so this SPD hip pain mess has been pretty horrible. My hips go numb no matter how I lay. Only thing that helps a little is pillows between the legs or sleeping in a recliner.  :(
TwoXChromosomes X When I first started using the diva cup, it seemed to make my cramps significantly worse.  So just be aware that it is a side effect that some people experience.  It was bad enough that on some days, I would have to switch back to tampons for a few hours.  My cramps are pretty bad in the first place though.  After 3-4 months that aspect of the diva cup seemed  to go away though and I have been able to not use tampons at all for several periods.  I still have half a box as backup or for friends or whatever, but I don't think I'll ever use tampons again if I can avoid it.  I've only had one almost leak, and I could definitely feel the leak starting.
TwoXChromosomes X Interesting. I am from Ontario, Canada, and annual is still the standard here as far as I know. My family doc will only continue my bc script with yearly paps. 
BabyBumps X You can decline the test.  If the test were to come up positive, would you want to get the amnio for further testing?  Not for the sake of aborting, but just to be able to prepare for what could be coming?  If you wouldn't get the amnio, don't get the first test.  They come back with a lot of false positives.  I declined the test because I felt that the amnio was too risky for the little one.
BabyBumps X The main reason I've heard that people who wouldn't terminate still choose to do the testing is for preparation - so they can know about any medical issues baby might have that can be or will need to be addressed immediately after the birth.  Makes sense to me, except for one thing.    It's one thing to prepare for something you KNOW is coming, but it's another matter entirely to try to prepare for something that MIGHT be coming.  The non-invasive tests are not 100% accurate, and many of them have false positives.  If you get a bad result from a non-invasive screen, you'll face the choice of either (a) worrying and freaking out about the results for the rest of the pregnancy or (b) getting an amnio to get the definitive results.  Even then, getting an amnio that says yes, your baby has Down Syndrome or yes, your baby has spina bifida can't necessarily tell you the severity of the DS or the spina bifida.  They would probably just monitor things very closely if that were the case - and you're already being monitored heavily because you're high risk.    So I would just ask your doctor what he/she would do differently if you had these tests and they came back abnormal.  I'm guessing they'd say they'd recommend amnio, etc., but push them and ask again what he/she would do differently if THOSE results came back abnormal.  I would guess (I'm not a doctor!) that they'd just monitor you more, and you're already being monitored frequently!
TwoXChromosomes X the disposable cups are awful, I recommend the non-disposable ones.  They may take some getting used to but they work! And no worrying about TSS.  I use the mooncup, but I think that the divacup is good too.   
BabyBumps X Well you've gained 13 pounds so far and you have about 13 weeks left of your pregnancy. Many women gain most of their weight in their 3rd trimester. To me it seems a little early to be mentioning your weight gain. If you want to try eating more calories then go ahead, but if you do just make sure they are good for you calories instead of calorie-rich junk food. 
TwoXChromosomes X Depends  on how heavy you flow is... I go through a super pad and a super tampon every 4 hours on my period
BabyBumps X I'm not trying to be rude but am generally confused how this is horrible?  It sounds like there were complications with her birth and they were successfully able to work around them and deliver her baby.  General anesthesia during a C-section is only used in severe emergencies.  To me it seemed like not having a C-section in this case would of killed her baby and they didn't have time to wait for her husband.
BabyBumps X How frequent are they? If you are high risk and they hurt that much you should go to the hospital to get checked out, if it's more than 4 per hour you need to get there ASAP.  As for the colostrum, when that starts is different for every woman. Some get it after the birth, some get it before the positive test, most get it sometime between the two.
TwoXChromosomes X It works just fine. The string is long enough that it sits around my cervix, and I'm careful to break the seal before I pull the cup out so I don't create a vacuum and accidentally dislodge my paragard. 
BabyBumps X Drink tons of water now till the amniotic fluid check and that should help.   Please also remember that this is your birth and if your OB is insisting on inducing you and it isn't what you want, you can find an OB who will honor your wishes. It is only too late to change OBs once the baby is born. I know people who have been a now show at their induction because they knew it wasn't right. Your birth. Your choice. 
TwoXChromosomes X whoops, my bad. I didn't use the ring for long enough (due to unpleasant side effects) to look into the mechanisms of birth control it used.
Parenting X A few suggestions:  - I would assume she has tried several different bottle types? If not, this is the first stop... My son would not take a drop from those brown latex bottle nipples, but would chug from just the plain cheap glass bottles with silicone nipples. My daughter will have nothing to do with either of those and will only drink from Nuk nipples that are flat on the bottom and round on the top (like her soother).  - Vary the temperature of the formula. Again, my son would drink it ice cold from the fridge, where as my daughter will not drink it unless it is almost too hot (she is seriously a princess when it comes to her bottle!)  - Did she ease him into formula or go cold turkey? At around 5 months, he's probably taking 6 oz. per bottle. Start with 4 oz breast milk and 2 oz. formula mixed together in a bottle. Slowly increase it until it is all Formula.  - Finally, try a sippy or straw. I have seen several kids that never take a bottle and go straight to sippy cups.  
BabyBumps X I'm feeling the same way today at 34 weeks.  The hip pain just started in the last week.  I haven't had the sciatica pain since I've been going to the chiropractor, though; it has really helped.  However, the hip pain makes me turn over constantly throughout the night.
BabyBumps X well, they're not for everyone... there are a lot of things that make a pregnancy too high risk to even use a birthing center across the street from a hospital... but that's to be expected!  I homebirth, myself. I am totally aware of the risks... but also already know what all will happen in every unlikely circumstance and what would require a transfer to the hospital... and I am okay and comfortable with that. Your birth center should be able to answer the same questions, basically:  "Can I risk out of using the birth center? What sort of issues would risk me out?" "What emergencies are you equipped to handle yourself, what would require transfer?" "What are your transfer rates?"
BabyBumps X One of my first symptoms (before the nausea, even), was extreme exhaustion!  It was kind of hilarious because I previously had issues sleeping and all of a sudden that was all I wanted to do, haha.  It did get better (though now that I'm only few weeks from my due date, I've definitely circled back to it xD), so hang in there!  Your body is going through a lot of changes, and it can definitely be normal to react that way to it.
BabyBumps X I thought long and hard about home birth, but I think I would be more comfortable in some sort of clinical setting the first go around. I'm pretty okay with going the hospital route if any complications arise beforehand, I definitely don't want to take unnecessary risks. But if it is a low risk throughout the pregnancy, I want to try this experience - while planning for the unexpected of course!   Since you do home births, can I ask a quick question? In a hospital the baby is there for a certain amount of time and then you all go home and the baby sees a doctors a few weeks later right? Do you see a doctor sooner in a home birth scenario? Just curious! 
TwoXChromosomes X That's an irrelevant distinction.  More broadly "life" is not so well defined, but life on earth as we know it is and all organisms (read: life) begin at conception.
BabyBumps X Cervadil gel to soften the cervix?  Yes.  One of my friends was induced this way and never had the pitocin.  She had pitocin with her first and ended up getting an epidural.  She just had cervadil with her second and everything else was natural.
BabyBumps X Rest well mama! Don't get discouraged about the breastfeeding. I had to supplement with my first. He didn't want to latch at first. Found out I had some inverted nipples. A WONDERFUL nurse gave me [this]( -Contact-Nipple-Shield-20mm/dp/B000YQMWLU) . What I did was put some formula with a sirenge thing in the little hole. Once my nipple was out and perky I would take it off and he kept on suckling like a champ. I didn't need to use those after about a week of that. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's fairly normal because your hormones can take several months to return to normal. And if you're breast feeding it will take several months AFTER you stop. I nursed for about 7 months and it was 14 months before I got my first period. 
BabyBumps X I was twelve weeks yesterday and also have a two year old and I feel exactly the same way!! Im exhausted and pukey. I have absolutely no advice but at least I feel your pain. It sucks. It really sucks! 
TwoXChromosomes X So does that mean you support the killing of brain dead people in hospitals?  Also fetuses begin to have brain activity around week 25... so would you, personally, be against abortion after that time?  It doesn't matter though; there is no scientific consensus on when life begins.
BabyBumps X Definitely.  I had my first ultrasound at 6W3D and she was just two little dots, one that had a heartbeat.  Not much to see, but the heartbeat still made me cry.  My 10W3D ultrasound was amazing, I could see her waving her arms and kicking, and she actually looked like a baby.
BabyBumps X I'm sorry to hear about your 1st pregnancy, I wish you the best with this one!   I lost quite a few pounds in my first pregnancy during the first trimester but not because of nausea, just pure lack of appetite. So I'm not too worried about the weight loss with this one, I think it's actually less, surprisingly. Thanks for the kind words!
BabyBumps X Yay!  I can only imagine the anticipation you're feeling KNOWING you get to meet your sweet baby tomorrow.  Maybe little man will work his way out on his own now that eviction is imminent.  Either way, I wish you nothing less than a beautiful birthing.  Can't wait to hear about it all!  Bumper hugs to you :)  
BabyBumps X starting my every 2 weeks blew my mind. I had an appointment last week and have another one next week? When did I get this far along?!  it's true, not getting the positive test until 6 weeks pregnant, makes the rest of the pregnancy just fly by!
BabyBumps X lol last pregnancy I found out for sure the day after my missed period (I'd been suspecting it for 4 days but every test until then was boldly negative)  With my second, I found out at 3 weeks! My mom forced me to test despite me protesting that "there's no way it will even come back positive if I AM, my period isn't due until next week!" Test. Faint positive, early ultrasound confirmed I was dated exactly how I thought. I have no clue how I got a positive so early. (Went in to the doctor, took their test. "Sorry, it's negative, come back in a few days if you haven't gotten your period." then on the way out "WAIT! I looked again... it IS positive but very faint!"  With my first I don't know if it was before or after I was due... that pregnancy lasted *forever* because I was on bedrest.   So this time around its just flying.
BabyBumps X No, you're about to the point now where baby is getting cramped, no matter how big you are that's around when you can start telling how baby is laying and where they are laying :)  I love playing "guess the body part" It's usually butt (if I feel a back below it) or knee (if it moves) but it's still a fun game.
TwoXChromosomes X yes but it's better than getting cervical cancer from not getting a yearly pap smear.  I live in Canada tho, a pap smear only costs me in time and discomfort. 
TwoXChromosomes X In 2010, [ACOG]( ~/media/For%20Patients/faq085.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20120430T1303176571) (assuming you're in the US) changed their guidelines and no longer recommend annual screens.  Unless/until you have an abnormal smear, they're now recommended every 2-3 years depending on your age.  I don't understand why gynos aren't changing their requirements though.  I had a clear pap in 2010, and called for a refill of Diflucan last year after I got a real rager of a yeast infection following some antibiotics.  I was informed I wouldn't have it filled until I had my 2011 pap test.  When I asked why they weren't using the ACOG guidelines, I got frosty "I don't know, that's just office policy".  It's also more $ in their pocket.
BabyBumps X My little guy is EXTREMELY active in there, you just have to roll with the punches really.    Just wait til he/she starts kicking your cervix.  That's fun :)
TwoXChromosomes X But that's the thing: the normal cycle is 28 days.  3-month packs make your body not follow the 28-days.    The only logical thing I could come up with is that you don't ovulate until ~10days after your period, so before that even happens, you're back on the pill and hormones block that. I just don't see the difference in skipping two doses and skipping 7 and not being protected after the former, but being okay after the later.    BOGGLING!
TwoXChromosomes X Have not experienced this personally. My best understanding is that, yes, there's a good chance it's the yeast infection. Alternately, it could be HPV, but many cases of HPV clear up on their own.   The thing to do now is schedule a follow up PAP in about 4-6 months. In the mean time eat well, sleep lots, and try not to stress. In the unlikely chance that this does need further treatment (a biopsy/colposcopy to remove abnormal cells) you caught it early. Try not to worry - that may be a tall order, but you have very, very little to be worried about.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, it is a "cleaner view". Vaginal walks are stretchy and therefore can collapse, obstructing the view of the cervix. As an ER nurse, I will tell you no doctor wants to hurt a woman during a pelvic. Clenching does make it worse and a good bedside manner goes far. But sometimes it's a pain in the butt to see the cervix and the only way to do it is with a large speculum.
Parenting X Yeah, these are anti-gas thingies. They didn't work all that well for us, we went through these, Dr Brown's, Tommee Tippee and wound up with Born Free. They have the funkiest anti-gas devices on them, but they actually work both as bottles and as anti-gas bottles. It took us a long time to figure out how to really clean them, but we're pros now.  The Tommee Tippee were the worst (the anti-gas valve leaks after a while), followed by avents (although we might have been using multiple levels of nipples and not known), Dr Brown (but these are a pain) and finally the Born Free bottles. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yes it is. That doesn't mean someone can do it without asking - a good doctor will talk you through every part of the exam, even saying things like "I'm going to touch your thigh now," and "okay, I'm going to do the bimanual." But it is a legitimate part of a pelvic exam.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I was taking them, only to find out later that, depending on what kind you're taking, and depending on how consistently you're taking them (it should be the same time every day), it can be much lower  But this isn't a problem with the effectiveness of the drug, it's a problem with the user not taking the drug correctly.  It's inaccurate to say the drug isn't effective overall.  It's very very effective you just need to follow instructions like with anything else.
BabyBumps X thankyou very much,and as for natural birth,compared to some,mine was relatively easy...not as easy as my sisters,she was in labour 2.5hours from beginning to end!
TwoXChromosomes X I'd had my mirena for two years now and it hurt like a bitch for 6 weeks straight when I got it put in (which may be because I've never had a kid, because my sister-in-law who got hers put in after childbirth had no pain whatsoever). I never had a regular period before, so I wasn't worried about having a regular one afterward. It gives you lighter periods for sure and it does make it go away for many women, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I get some phantom cramps for a couple of days every 4-6 weeks, but nothing major. The hormones are very similar to birth control, so you might experience emotional issues the same way you would with the pill. I know people who have had to add a low dose anti-depressant to counteract the effects - if you've had issues with hormonal BC in the past (like the pill), it's something you should talk about with your gyn and a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
TwoXChromosomes X Please know that a lot of HPV infections can clear if your immune system is normal without leading to any abnormal cervical cell changes. Just make sure you get your recommended PAP Smears to keep an eye on it. You seem to already be on top of things with knowing that you have HPV. 
Parenting X Beautiful photos! I don't think I could ever do a homebirth though. I'd be too terrified of something going wrong and not having the medical support to do something about it. When my little 2 month old was born (right on time, no indications of problems at all during the pregnancy) he wound up being just a little too big. Head: 1, Pelvis: 0. Wound up having to get an emergency C-section otherwise it could have killed us both. 
Parenting X Nope. This is a completely fictional complaint (an example of your demonization of the hospital process)  No medical staff will ever pressure a person to get something as stupid as an epidural.   An epidural doesn't HELP a birth, if fact it HINDERS it.. and they KNOW this.   The increase in epidural rates is because more women are demanding it, not because staff pressure patients into something that makes a birth take longer and increases the chance of complications.
Parenting X That's great! My wife is a midwife and we both 100% support home births.   But there are so many sad stories about people either not having trained medical staff present, or having nutjob natural birth midwives that ignore repeated warning signs that medical intervention is necessary and baby and/or mother dies a completely preventable shitty death.
BabyBumps X Awww sorry your hormones are making things worse for you.  I'm sure it will pass in due time.  Maybe the troll lurking about either hates their mommy, can't have children or lost their baby and is taking it out on all of the pregnant/new moms?
BabyBumps X My first, I had a placental abruption at 17 weeks, so I know her terror (to an extent, losing him was a very real risk). I just wish her as much luck as I had (well, she won't make it past 40 weeks with twins, not likely... I made it past 40 weeks with him... but still full term, for sure, is what I am hoping for!)
Parenting X If you, or anyone else reading this, is ever thinking about a homebirth, but concerned about not having the medical support, I really recommend meeting with a midwife prior to deciding not to use them.  I had no intention of using one, and only went to an information session at the insistence of my now ex.  I was amazed by the high level of support offered by a midwife during pregnancy and postnatal care, and am so happy I took that time to open my mind to the option.  I did have complications with my first delivery. My midwife recognized this, we transferred to the hospital, and my daughter was born there about 1/2 hour after I arrived. As part of my prenatal care, we were registered at the hospital prior to my labour, and my midwives had my records with them, so transferring from home to the hospital was really easy.  Be aware that that midwives are (generally, depending on your location) trained specialists. In the same way that your Ob-Gyn is going to transfer care of your baby to a pediatrician if special attention is needed, so also will a midwife transfer care of you to a specialist if it is needed.     Also, I can't speak for all midwives, but mine had an agreement with one of the local hospitals so that moms wanting epidurals could still use a midwife.    TL;DR- Meet with a midwife before deciding they aren't for you.
BabyBumps X I started with that pain at 22 weeks, it was so painful that I couldn't  stand up or walk,  but I just started to bike ride 10 miles a day and it helps so much.
Parenting X  The anesthesiologists on duty when I went in to the hospital were all dealing with some big ER emergency. The one on call barely arrived in time to give me the epidural and it was pretty rough but not completely unbearable. To be honest, if my baby's head hadn't been too big to actually fit I probably would have finished before I got any drugs in at all. As it was, it took another six hours after I got the drugs before they realized he just wasn't coming the normal way and frankly, if I hadn't gotten the epidural I would have made them do a C-section a heck of a lot earlier. The lady in the room next to mine apparently did just fine without an epi though! 
Parenting X Most Hospitals in America don't have Nitrous for birthing women. You have narcotics through IV or Epidural and those are usually your only options. For instance in the whole of the two states I have lived in my only options were epidural or another narcotic if I wanted any pain relief. 
TwoXChromosomes X Had mine placed in November. Up until this point I had had a 8 month long period. This stopped that day. I then got a regular period for 7 days every three weeks or so. This seems to have stopped now so maybe three months in, and this past week I had perios symtoms, cramps etc with very little or no actual bleeding. Interesting stuff. I think that has affected my sex drive negatively, and i also think i am getting ovarian cyst like pain. But I still like it...
BabyBumps X My best friend has only one baby. She went 41 weeks and when they were about to induce her, her water broke on its own and her baby was here in less than 3 hours. She never really had  much of a birth plan - what happens, happens - and she never used the epidural or anything. She was the size of a planet before she gave birth (bless her heart) and her daughter was almost 9 pounds. No complications, no stitching required. So try not to be too scared! :) I'm not too worried about it.
BabyBumps X Your doctor gave you it knowing your actual due date and your actual time in pregnancy.   As far as I've ever been told 12 weeks is the "cutoff" for "first trimester" when it comes to medications that are not advised to be taken in the first trimester. I would really trust your doctor that they knew how far along you are and would not have told you something that would harm baby.
TwoXChromosomes X I used to get breakthrough bleeding as well, but that can stop. Now I only get a bit of spotting after six or seven months of continuous pill taking.  My doctor said that chances are good that I will see even that spotting go away, eventually. 
BabyBumps X I would not torerate anyone mutilating my children. And yes, I have a boy. It's HIS penis. If he's 15 and wants it gone, fine. But you don't chop off bits of people without thier consent. Yes, I'd push the issue. Show her circumsion videos. Make her go to the hospital and watch a few.
TwoXChromosomes X insertion was very painful. It was like your worst period cramps. afterward, when the doctor was explaining everything, i passed out. It was the first time I had ever fainted and it was very concerning to me. I continued to have cramps for about a month and then they stopped, along with my period, and I was a happy period-free girl for about 5 years! Removal was much easier :)
BabyBumps X My personal opinion is to both come to a decision on it. Circumcision is a painful procedure and is often done without anesthetic. Both my sons aren't circumcised, and because less people are circumcising their boys these days, it will be the norm when they are adults. Many difficulties can arise from circumcision, such as a botched one, tearing of the glans (head), infection from urine and feces because of the diaper... I am against circumcision *unless* it is medically necessary. There are small benefits to circumcision, as in not having to clean as much, but cleaning is routine and is no more of a chore than brushing your teeth or combing your hair. And also infections are less common with circumcision, mind you my sons have never had an infection so far, at ages 5 and 3, still intact. Removing the foreskin is a religious custom, because 80% of sensitivity is removed with the foreskin, it was to lower the incidence of "sin" (the same religious reason girls are still being cut in some countries) and because there was little available water to clean with (being in the desert areas and such).  Here's a link on circumcision, it's NSFW, NSFL, and not safe for the squeamish and for those who don't like the blood-curdling screams of infant -fap.net/ no pun intended... The information presented is a circumcision video with some literature, showing how a conventional one is done. 
BabyBumps X There is a large, massive difference in the removal of an infant boys' foreskin, and the forceful, violent mutilation of girls' and womens' labia, clitorises (clitori?, and sewing up of vaginas.  Most of which are done with dirty tools in unsterile enviroments, where as in America, most circumsicions are done in hospital or doctor's office, with clean surroundings and sterile tools.  
Parenting X babycenter.com is the best website I ever found. Also get the book "What to expect when you're expecting."  CONGRATS!!
BabyBumps X Growth spurt, perhaps?  I have days where I feel like I'm constantly hungry too.  It's definitely weird for me because like I said earlier, I had really bad morning sickness (and still have it to this day), so I feel like my body is trolling me sometimes, haha.  I say, just let yourself have it.  Again, you're making an effort, which is awesome, and not every day is going to be the same!
BabyBumps X We circumcised our oldest, but not our youngest after I did the research. My husband wanted it done again, but knew I had done the research and there was not a big enough medical benefit to doing so. If my son wants it done when he is older, we will pay for it then. I've heard from many moms who end up having sons with issues due to their circumcision and some had to be recircumcised.   ETA: I also wanted to say it is no different than cleaning a circumcised penis. You do NOT retract the foreskin. The child will do so once they are old enough and doing so prematurely can cause damage. Also if one would circumcise, it is best to wait until they are at least 7-8 days old when their levels, etc. stabilize. They only do it in the hospital as a convenience factor.
Parenting X An aside: I did not choose to plan a homebirth for the pleasantness of the experience. I chose that route because I believe, based on a thorough literature review, that homebirth with a midwife like minr is as safe as and much more heathy than hospital births with most OBs.   But that's a whole other conversation. 
TwoXChromosomes X I believe in a certain amount of paid holidays too.    I want  to create a exception that says when parents are expecting a child they may take some time off to bond with their family. The thing that every other OCED, and most other nations, have.  My coworker can take that leave now, and I'll take that leave when I have a child. 
BabyBumps X Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!  It will take time for your mind and body to heal.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  Just try to spend time with your baby and rest as much as possible.  You might want to talk to someone about your fear if it doesn't go away soon.
TwoXChromosomes X It is an embryo from conception to 3 months It is a fetus from 3 months to birth It is a child at birth  Just had this discussion the other day. These are the actual medical terms for a growing fetus in a woman's body.  (Just sharing so you know what to call [noun], I would say this still counts as a fetus, IMO)
TwoXChromosomes X If I remember correctly, it is standard to do so. The cells were not cancerous. I think the dr was able to tell from my pap that I had HPV, but it wasn't until after the colposcopy that they could tell that it was "high risk."  I found that fact annoying since I had already finished the guardasil vaccine. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was lucky in that my brother's girlfriend (now wife) was comfortable enough to let me come in with her and observe her appointment. By the time I got in the chair, I was fine because I knew what was coming. It happened to be that the doctor was an older man, but he was really nice and comforting so I knew I was ok. I've since been to other doctors that I was uncomfortable with, which sucked, so I definitely think it's important for her to at least meet the doctor before she has her appointment. You should also let her have a say on the age/gender of the doctor and try to accomodate her preference as best you can (it'll help minimize awkwardness). Also, she should make sure to tell the doctor that it's her first appointment ever before the examination starts so that he/she can make accommodations (like not using the speculum). In my experience, the best doctors have been the ones who have told me what they're doing every step of the way and checked in with me every so often to make sure I'm doing ok. Let your daughter know that it's absolutely ok if she gets scared or uncomfortable - she can ask the doctor to stop at any time. Good luck to both of you!
BabyBumps X I plan to because all my siblings babies sucked their thumbs for a looooong time. You can take away a pacifier but you can't take away a thumb. 
BabyBumps X You'll start feeling it soon.  The first few times it felt like gas bubbles to me.  Now, I'm relieved to have the extra cushioning.  Especially after his antics last night...
TwoXChromosomes X Don't take a pregnancy test yet. Wait until the 14th. Just about any pregnancy test would say negative because it's far too early to detect a pregnancy.  You would be almost three weeks pregnant, starting from the first day of your last period. THIS week would need to be the one where you conceived. So don't worry. You're probably not pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X Usually it is right after your first missed period - but there are some that will say on the box that they test earlier - have him look for those.   Honestly though, it is really unlikely you are pregnant. My very first time this exact same thing happened (at the same age) and I made myself sick worrying about it. 
TwoXChromosomes X Average 28 days in a menstrual cycle, average 4 day period
BabyBumps X Ugh, jealous!  With my first I felt movement at 20 weeks.  I heard with the second you feel it sooner, but I'm almost 18 weeks and nothing!  Feeling discouraged.
TwoXChromosomes X It does happen but is fairly improbable you are pregnant if you used birth control. Tender breasts are a common PMS symptom that can arise a week or so before your period starts...and even if you were pregnant it is way to early for you to start exhibiting symptoms like constipation. I am currently 24 weeks pregnant. The couple months before my husband and I conceived I read into every symptom including sore breasts and moodiness as proof I was pregnant...and I wasn't. The month I did conceive I noticed far less symptoms in the first few weeks. It seems your cycles run around the average 28 days which puts your likely ovulation time in the last couple days or so. Of course sometimes women ovulate earlier or later in their cycles. Honestly I would try not to worry or make yourself sick over it. It is way to early for you take any kind of pregnancy test. Wait until the day your period is due and take a test.....Good luck! 
BabyBumps X It really has to do more with the position of the baby. I'm surprised you know two people where the techs got it wrong, I feel like it's pretty rare they are wrong! I had an ultrasound at 16 weeks and the doctor said girl, then at 20 weeks the tech said she couldn't tell, at 22 weeks I had a 3D ultrasound, baby had her legs spread to the world and it was definitely a girl. Usually anytime between about 16/17 weeks, until about 33/34 weeks you can tell the sex of the baby, assuming your baby is in a good position. Later on it may be a bit easier in that everything is more "grown" but as you said, too late and baby is too squished to spread it's legs! 
TwoXChromosomes X california gives me free nuvarings and condoms and everything planned parenthood has to offer. yay liberal states!
TwoXChromosomes X Plan B works the day after intercourse by preventing implantation of any potential embryos. One's period comes 2 weeks after ovulation, which means it's 2 weeks after conception.  Plan B won't work 2 weeks after conception, the embryo is already implanted. 
BabyBumps X Good luck :)   I really can't tell you which it is for certain, but if it's progressing as it sounds like it is, it sounds much more like early labor than false labor. As for if you are getting close... again, I can't answer that. Some women can be in early labor for a pretty darn long time before it's time to head in/call the midwives over. others it could turn around suddenly and once you are at the hospital/midwives are at the house, it's just a little while before baby comes.
BabyBumps X I also lost the worst nausea at 8 weeks! It's back now and then but nothing like the first few weeks. Hormones are changing throughout pregnancy, nothing to worry about.
BabyBumps X Our hospital wanted the doctor information.  We had narrowed down the clinic but not the doctor so I just told them to pick one so the clinic would at least get the medical records.  
BabyBumps X Slight cramping is normal but bleeding might be something to talk to your doctor about. Did you have sex beforehand? Sometimes you can bleed a little after that because of all the increased blood in the cervix. 
BabyBumps X You are 5'2"? I don't think you are too big. Like 42 degrees said - it really depends on your torso size, muscle tone, uterus position, etc. As long as your doctor hasn't mentioned anything, I wouldn't be worried.  I'm 5'0" and about 5 weeks behind you. I already have a noticeable belly so I'm thinking my tummy will be about that size in 5 weeks too.
TwoXChromosomes X What I meant is it uses the same hormones as the implant, but I don't remember what they had mentioned as far as dosage comparison. I'm not sure on any comparisons for the shot to the pill. What I was thinking was that if you had considered the implant and were bothered by the thought of having something surgically implanted in your arm, that the shot shouldn't be much different. Obviously it would be something to discuss with your doctor, but it's another idea you could look into.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Some doctors will refuse to sterilize a woman, especially if she does not have any children.   To be fair, some doctors will also refuse to perform a vasectomy on a male as well.
BabyBumps X Shut the hell up. We really are pregnant twins! I've been losing mine also. And it started this morning. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've been through pelvic floor physiotherapy too, to treat my vaginismus/high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction.  See my post [here]( _update_i_lost_my_virginity_after_years/) for details on how I overcame it, and feel free to ask me anything.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't have advice necessarily, but I am also a one-ovary "cyster" so I can tell you about my experience. I managed to get pregnant less than a year after my surgery (removal of a 17 cm corpus luteum cyst that torsed my left ovary) and this was after taking Plan B! So needless to say we were a little surprised but it was a miracle. I am now 13 weeks.  The fact that 2 of the cysts are "complex" isn't great, because usually they don't do anything about the fluid-filled simple cysts. Complex cysts are the type that are more likely to be cancerous, although DON'T FREAK OUT because they probably aren't. It is more likely they are full of pus and other gross shit. Because they contain stem cells, complex cysts have been known to have hair and teeth and other biological matter in them, which is gross but kind of cool IMO. The good news is, your doctors have been monitoring you so I'm sure the cysts are not as large as your last one and it is likely that you will be able to keep the ovary even after surgery. Even if you have a small section of your ovary, you can still ovulate and still get pregnant. And, yes, still get your period. Remember, the female reproductive system is incredibly resilient and pretty much never wants to give up on having babies.  Interestingly, I was dealing with cysts all the time on my remaining ovary even after my surgery, but now that I am pregnant all the symptoms are gone and I no longer get cysts because eggs are no longer being released. Of course, I have a WHOLLLLE range of other symptoms that come with pregnancy, but the cyst pain is gone. And believe me, I know the pain and the nausea and how fucking horrible it is to have to work and continue on with life while you have that going on.  Keep us updated!!!
BabyBumps X Thank you for your advice. =) I ended up calling and they said to keep an eye on the bleeding and if it got worse to come in ASAP! But after I called the bleeding stopped and my bean was as kicky as ever! 
BabyBumps X Personally, if it's not a health issue I don't see the benefit of performing a religious ceremony on a child who has no say in their body modification. Also, setting boundaries with your friends an family early on might be a good idea as I was more than a little concerned to read that you were considering this because they think it's a good idea regardless of how you, his mother, feels. Can you imagine the conversation explaining that to your son?   My husband, father, and brothers don't seem to have a problem "fitting in" with the Jewish community we are a part of....honestly, how many men go around looking at other guys penises and ridiculing them for having intact foreskin?? Cleaning an uncut penis is not hard and should be retracted for cleaning only AFTER the foreskin can retract on its own (with out forcing it) 
BabyBumps X I had a positive result after having my period be 4 weeks late. Turned out I randomly missed a period for an un explained reason, but I still ovulated and became pregnant. Maybe that happened to you?
BabyBumps X &gt; ...and didn't get motion sick  Wait, is that a thing?  I thought I was crazy; I hadn't had a bit of nausea at all, but had to run out of the Hunger Games a few months ago because I felt so ill.  I'm really not the only one?!  Awesome!!
BabyBumps X I've NEVER had motion sickness before this pregnancy. It seems to be an extension of morning sickness.  was terrified that the 3-D would trigger it
BabyBumps X Drinking cranberry juice is helpful for preventing them. I'm very prone to them for some reason (despite good hygene) but as long as I drink cranberry juice daily, I don't get them. You can also get capsules. I would think that it would help cure a YI, too.
TwoXChromosomes X This happened to me once but just before the 2 month mark I got my period. I had started a new job and had to get up earlier and I think that schedule change delayed it.   Pregnancy tests get more and more accurate in that one day after your period might show negative but one week should should positive and 2 weeks pretty much definitely would.  I felt so physically unwell when my period was late that I thought I was pregnant but I was not!
BabyBumps X I would wait. Those four weeks will *fly* by. I found out I was pregnant on January 5th and it seriously feels like a week ago. Being pregnant makes time fly by so fast. I know how you feel though - I was so anxious at my appointment before the gender screening. I was 15 weeks and I was sooooo hoping they would do an ultrasound but all they did was a heartbeat check. I thought I would die before the next appointment 5 weeks later but it honestly came very quickly.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, it happens. Anything related to the vagina and any type of fluid coming out of anyplace is probably normal, unless it's similar to cottage cheese.
TwoXChromosomes X False. Any infection/bacteria passed through the urethra can upset the outer vulval flora, causing a concurrent yeast infection, other discharge or irritation.           (It doesn't eliminate an STI though, so I do agree on that.)
TwoXChromosomes X I had holiday cystitis for over a year, saw about 15 doctors in that time and only one.. ONE told me about preventatives.   ASK YOUR DOCTOR FOR ONE, I used Macrodantin and its worked on one of my other friends who had the same issues.  I havent had a UTI in over 2 years now.  I was taking cranberry pills, drinking cranberry juice (no added sugar), changed my diet, peed TWICE, got STI checks on my partner and myself, showered, used a giney soap thing all after sex and nothing worked besides taking a preventative.   Good luck, I know how painful they can be &lt;3
BabyBumps X Where abouts are you?  I've saved up 7 weeks recreation leave, work gives me 14 weeks paid mat leave, and in Australia we get 18 weeks minimum wage from the government as well.  I can take my rec leave and work mat leave at half pay.  My biggest problem is that that adds up to 60 weeks, and I can only take 52 off, so I have to organise where I want it to overlap!  Admittedly, half pay is not totally awesome, somewhere around $850 a fortnight, but very good pay for not actually working.  How much of your 52 weeks is paid leave?
beyondthebump X Oh I'm sorry. I think she just got used to it in the NICU and since my boobs were only available 4 hours a day..... The pacifier was the next best thing. Much preferred to the feeding tube and bottles lol
TwoXChromosomes X I tried everything. I had UTI's every month for a year. I could do nothing to prevent it.  What worked? I stopped drinking citrus drinks. NO ORANGE JUICE. EVER.  You definitely need to keep doing everything else - like cranberry juice/pills, peeing after sex, and lots and lots of water. You should never have a yellow pee - it should always be clear.
beyondthebump X Hehe, glad it worked so far!  If you're not trying to build up an extra frozen supply, don't fully pump at night when your baby doesn't need it.  Pump enough to take the edge off yourself, but don't significantly empty the breast.  It'll help gently ease your body onto the baby's feeding schedule and give you some relief.
BabyBumps X My story with #2: dilated to 4, walked around like that for a month then one day, bloody show! Contractions! Baby! In a matter of 8 hours, with no previous warning. At all. I spent the day frustrated with being pregnant and ended up having her the next morning.  My story with #3: check cervix at 11pm, no dilation or effacement whatsoever. Baby not engaged. Wake between 4 and 5 to bloody show. Then contractions. Then baby less than 12 hours later (from bloody show) I had spent the day before frustrated and went to bed completely discouraged only to have baby in arms the next afternoon.  And this isn't just how it is for me, its how it is for most women. Cervical checks don't tell you anything. You could still have that baby tonight before midnight. Or tomorrow. Or 2 weeks from now. Most likely, most probably, with statistics on your side, you will have that baby in a few days.  But not everyone is a statistical average woman.   I can guarentee, however, that you will not be pregnant forever, no woman ever has been. And a lack of labor symptoms only means you are not in labor at this exact moment and not that you are not going into labor anytime soon. 
BabyBumps X I moved from when I was a few weeks along to about five weeks. I didn't know I was pregnant at the time and I was exhausted the whole time. I was running on pure adrenaline at times  My husband still did the bulk o the moving and was a huge trooper, since I had no reason whatsoever to be a slacker. When we found out I was prego, though, his first words were "No wonder you made me move everything!" sigh. 
AskWomen X Likestea is right. Still could be the meds. I have also DEFINITELY noticed *huge* differences in my cycle compared to stress levels. Mine seems opposite in that it's heavier when I'm stressed and lighter when relaxed. I've even had periods that literally lasted 2 days with 3 tampons and a panty-liner worth of flow. It was completely circumstantial.  I still recommend pee on a stick!!! Either way you'll have an answer. 
TwoXChromosomes X That's true.  However, it's relatively easy to double up on birth control methods.  Anything + condom is one option, and in a few years men will have a birth control shot as well.  If the success rate is 99.997, and everyone is using responsibly, that's not a whole lot of parents who can't support their children compared to what we have now.
TwoXChromosomes X But you don't know you're pregnant.... you said the test was negative. If you're stressing yourself out this much you can cause your body to actually skip an entire month. I've done that many times before. Don't worry until it says YES!
beyondthebump X HUZZAH! I'm so glad for, Turtle, and baby Clara! &lt;3  When you feel the baby blues again, come back to this post, and read about Baby Clara's Winningest Day. =) It'll get easier and easier. And hurray maybe you have one of those "early sleep through the night" babies too! Fingers crossed for you! Amazing what a few more hours of sleep does for everyone, eh? 
BabyBumps X I could be from sex, Lifting something heavy, twisting.  Don't panic, I had bleeding in my first, and everything was fine. I'm sure loads of us have had bleeding and everything turned out fine.  Am I right girls? 
BabyBumps X I first felt Babybean at 14 weeks, and my SO first felt him at around 18 or 19 weeks. He would kick on and off, but now I feel him all the time.
TwoXChromosomes X I've read a great number of reviews on copper IUDs (ParaGard, etc).  A lot of people have reported negative emotional and physical side effects, their partners getting poked by the strings, heavy bleeding, etc - not to mention they are also fairly expensive for people without the best health insurance.  If anyone can give positive feedback on XYZ form of BC, I'd be interested to hear.
BabyBumps X I think I'm actually on track, for now.  I'm up about 16lbs, but I gained the last 12 in about a month.  I just like to track stuff, though.  But yeah, I just need to slow down a bit.  :-P
TwoXChromosomes X I have worked in free-standing birth centers for the last 2 years.  We have most of the same medications they do in the hospital for emergencies- pitocin, methergine, misoprostol, epinephrine, mag/sulfate, turbutaline, oxygen  We monitor moms and babies- taking vitals, listening to babies heart beats, etc.  Licensed and Certified Professional Midwives are trained in normal, natural childbirth. It's what we do. We do not take women who are high-risk. We transfer women out of care prenatally if they become high-risk. We are trained to recognize when things step outside "normal" and we transfer care prenatally or to the hospital in labor. We transfer at "pink" flags that something is going on that isn't normal rather than waiting for "red" flags.  A true emergency in our population of low-risk women is less than 1%. New research has shown that birthing at home or in a birth center with a professional midwife is as safe as having a baby in the hospital, and has fewer interventions.
BabyBumps X What job do you work? Even at my job as a waitress it is illegal for them to fire me. I get at least 6 weeks of maternity leave (up to 12) so that when I come back my position will still be available to me. Look up OSHA and read about workers rights and maternity leave, I'm not sure your job is being quite honest with you.
BabyBumps X Nothing.  I was the one worrying because I just didn't feel pregnant at all.  I think that might have been one of the weeks where I suddenly popped out a bit more, but I don't know.    I've had the more uneventful pregnancy ever! Zero morning sickness, etc etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X Lube is a miracle worker! I just use the tiniest amount and everything works so much better. Before it hurt basically every time, even if I was 110% aroused. Now I just use a few drops of lube and nothing hurts :)
BabyBumps X I feel the exact same way.  I am 5'2" and all baby.  My doctor actually told me that I look like I am going to pop and said that he hopes that I do not go another 4 weeks because I would be SO uncomfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X I talked to my lady doc about an IUD last Thursday.  She said it was possible for my guy to feel the strings with an IUD, and if that was the case they could clip them shorter.  The idea still gave me the heebie-jeebies so I went with Depo instead.  Another option is Implanon (a little rod injected into your arm).  Good to go for 2-3 years I think, but the upfront costs were high.  Another 'nother option is the Nuva ring.  You can take it out during sex and put it back in once you're done.  Hope this info helps. :)
BabyBumps X I used one with my son and never had problems with ear infections and it didn't interfere with nursing. I took it from him at 6 months old so as not to form an awful habit and to prevent any tooth issues. He's never sucked his thumb. I'm completely happy with what the bink provided and how it all went, but I know for others its not so easy. Wait a bit if you do give one to establish good nursing.
BabyBumps X Neither of my kids took to pacifiers, no matter how hard we tried.  Daughter never touched her thumb, son started sucking on his a little bit, but hasn't in months now (he's 10 months old).
BabyBumps X I am on #1 and felt it around 17 weeks.  From the outside my husband could feel it at week 18 if it was a big movement.  My sister said she could feel her second one as early as week 13.  We are both small/petite.
beyondthebump X I was in a very similar boat just last week! I was induced and I managed to go several hours of contractions (2 minutes apart- 45 seconds to 1 minute long each) before I asked for pain meds. When they gave them to me, I tried morphine/gravol first. Did nothing for me. Then I tried the one they just put in your IV and the laughing gas. These worked BETTER, but I was in back labour so I ended up caving and asking for an epidural. This was at 11pm- I was induced at 8am. I must say- the epidural was HEAVEN. I wish I could go back in time and cave earlier because it eased my stress so much and made the whole experience much less miserable. I sincerely believe things went easier because of the epi. Also- I had to get an emergency c section- this was easier to do because I had already had the epidural so the spinal was easier to administer. Don't worry about it! Induced labour was tough for me because baby was in the wrong position so I went into back labour. I happen to know several women who were induced and had relatively easy labours compared to some who did it naturally.   As for the milk- I wasn't leaking beforehand AND I had a c section and I had colostrum right away. Baby actually needs very little of this, so don't worry. My milk came in the day I left the hospital, which due to my c section was 48 hours after delivery. TAKE EVERY DAY YOU CAN IN HOSPITAL - assuming money isn't an issue. I'm Canadian (no cost) so I stayed every hour they let me- the nurses are phenomenal and there are tons of diapers/pads/juice/mesh undies available to use.   Good luck! Don't worry too much about it!
AskWomen X The kids/no kids thing is outdated info. Currently IUDs are considered a good option for women without children, but it's true the insertion may be slightly more difficult (the ob can use an injection to numb the cervix during insertion).   But since you want something you can deal with yourself, it's still not a good choice.
BabyBumps X I went from a 36DD to a 40F by 16 weeks.  I went to Motherhood Maternity and got fitted and bought them there.  That is the only maternity store we have in town.  They seem to be holding up pretty well so far.
BabyBumps X I never threw up, I just felt nauseous most of the time, and tired the rest of it. And my body copes with nausea in such a weird way (by eating ALL THE THINGS) and so I didn't lose weight like a lot of women for their first trimester. I gained a ton!  Anyway, I only felt like that for a period of 6ish weeks, going back-and-forth between "Nuuh I feel like throwing up" to "Nuuh I want all this food" and then one day it was all gone.  Then, three weeks later, I felt her kick. That's when I felt pregnant. :)  And just like you, I'm progressing just like my mom. No vomiting, and feeling the baby move on the last day of my 15th week.
BabyBumps X The doctor told me it happens literally every single day that a patient thought her water broke, and it ended up being pee/discharge. But he's never upset with them coming in, he rather we all come in- then that one women whose water really broke and doesn't. But I ended up with a planned c-section, so my water never broke, so I still don't know what it feels like! But most women water don't break before labor, most labors start with contractions so it's less likely water breaking with be your first sign. I was told if you can stop it with your muscles it's not water, if you sneeze/cough and more comes out or when you're laying down more comes out, then it's most likely your water.  Sorry I couldn't be more help! 
Parenting X &gt;This birth center essentially explained to us that is not what the nursery is for. It is only for sick babies.  It must vary by hospital. Our hospital suggested to us that we do this for some of the time, we hadn't even thought of it. 
BabyBumps X My wife and I loved our bottle brush, u dont usually think about till u have to clean a bottle at 2am and u cant get the last little bit of old formula off the damn side.
BabyBump X -sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/402980_10150680132883627_726028626_11149516_1082703944_n.jpg  ^ Me at 12 week -ash3/523054_10150833543268627_726028626_11704155_742518993_n.jpg  ^ Me at 22 weeks, 2 weeks ago  I've gotten enormous, LOL!! Your bump is too cute! :D
TwoXChromosomes X So let me get this right, because I think I missed something...You have an outbreak on your ladybits, which you get tested and find out is HSV-1, which is the oral type but can show up down there from oral sex. He HAS HSV-1(we know, because he gets cold sores), and he is calling you a slut and blaming this on you?? Oh helllllllllll nooo.....
BabyBumps X I feel completely normal. No morning sickness, just sore breasts
TwoXChromosomes X To be fair, 98% *is* a pretty terrible effectiveness rate for birth control for perfect use. *However*, lucky for you, the actual effectiveness rate of the patch according to Wikipedia is 99.7%.
BabyBumps X Honestly, if you have a JcPenney near you...GO THERE! They have some really cute maternity clothes at a really good price. I bought about 5 pants for work and 2 jeans for under $100. And they are sooo comfortable. The brand is Duo Maternity. I could wear them as pajama pants. I haven't really found better pants/bottoms than I have at JCP.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not too sure bout the redness. But if you were itching it it could just be that you itched too hard? Also, I take asidopholis pills it really helps clear up the yeast infection. 
TwoXChromosomes X the redness suggests irritation (probably from the itchiness), which is a normal symptom of a yeast infection.   you can give some relief to the area by inserting plain, sugar free yogurt into your vagina. using a tampon applicator is great for this. you can even fill an applicator an then freeze it first.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you ever heard of implanon? It's a little polymer rod that gets inserted under your arm, it lasts for 3 years and is 99.95% effective. I love it because I don't have to remember to do anything. Just an extra option you might prefer!  My SO never had any complaints about my choice of BC, both of us hate condoms so any way to get rid of them was great for us. Obviously we're not worried about STIs. But yeah...I don't think my SO would have presumed to know more about my BC than I do even though I did a lot of research and had it explained to me by a doctor, and he hadn't done any of that. Frankly I'd be pissed if he tried to "mansplain" why my decision was wrong. Not that he would do that.  So yeah...whilst I think you should take his needs/views into account, you should make sure he is properly informed first. Because it seems like he may not be.  
TwoXChromosomes X I had some cramping outside of when I had my period for the first few months after I got my copper IUD. It was pretty bad for the first few weeks. Not daily after that but noticeable and bad enough to pop an advil or something for though. My doctor said much more cramping wasn't unusual for the first six months as your body adjusted and sure enough at the six month mark everything just settled down on its own. Like my body kinda shrugged and accepted that this thing wasn't going anywhere :P   Being on the pill made me a psycho mess so I was really determined to make this work for me. Physical discomfort for a few months seemed like a small price to pay for my sanity so I decided I was gonna wait til the six month mark to say anything if it was still bugging me. You know your body and what you can tolerate though. Asking your doctor can't hurt.
TwoXChromosomes X My first day is very heavy--I tend to fill the diva cup twice (or rather 3/4 of the way twice).  Until you've got the technique down you'll probably want a back up pad, and you'll have to figure out if you'll be comfortable changing it in a public washroom.  Personally I love it and have no trouble with it now, the first two months were a bit of a learning experience though, I think it's great for the heavier start of my flow because it holds much more than a tampon does and is much less irritating for my skin than a pad is.
BabyBumps X I lost a job due to how much *they* were sending *me* home due to hyperemesis (severe morning sickness)  Despite a doctors note assuring them that my puking was *not* contagious and should not cause an issue as long as I was allowed to run to the bathroom any time necessary... I was only a temp. :(  Anyway... then with my second I was working in a deli and I think I missed a week total. All of it was in the first trimester while dealing with the morning sickness, second tri I felt fine and never had an issue and third I was allowed to sit on a stool any time I had to stand in one spot for a length of time so it wasn't an issue.
BabyBumps X I've missed 3 or 4 days due to exhaustion and morning sickness. I couldn't hold anything down and so when I stood for long periods of time I would get dizzy.  I missed 3 days last week because I had strep throat :/ my boss has been extremely understanding and I am so grateful because I really need my job!
TwoXChromosomes X I got the Paragard IUD in late February. The insertion was really uncomfortable and the cramps that day were absolutely awful! Had to take several ibuprofen and use a heating pad as well. Next day I was completely fine! I didn't have sex for about a week after that and I had no problems with it shifting or anything like that. My boyfriend commented later that he could feel the strings but he didn't mind. They also soften up after some time, when you first get it inserted they are almost like fishing line. You can have them trimmed during your checkup if its a problem. My periods are a decent amount heavier, probably 2-3x heaver...I only used regular tampons for maybe 2-3 days then lights for the rest. Now I have to use super tampons for 4-5 days and I have to change them very frequently. I don't experience bad cramping though, only some mild cramping which I always had with my periods. Overall I love it! I like having no hormones and that I don't have to get it replaced for 12 years! Also my insurance covered it all except for a $35 copay. I've heard with the Mirena you may not have any period after a while. You may like that better, I personally like having the reassurance of my period every month. Hope this helps! :)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; it was kind of like the IUD itself apparently. it doesnt seem like a comfortable option with this partner.  If your partner could feel the plastic of your IUD you had bad placement
BabyBumps X What you are feeling, don't feel bad for feeling that way, it's pretty normal, especially when you feel like crap and haven't gotten any "good" signs of pregnancy. Many women have issues "bonding" with a baby that is, to them, nothing more than a sick feeling.   I know I have never felt really pregnant instead of just miserable before I can feel babys kicks. And even then its a "miserable but for a good reason" 
BabyBumps X This! JC Penny has great maternity clothes. Very cute, very comfortable and reasonably priced. 
BabyBumps X I had cramping every day for almost the entire first trimester.  Never any bleeding though and I did call the doctor before my 8 week appointment because a lot of it was one sided (right side) and I was worried.  They said there was nothing to worry about unless there was bleeding or the paint spiked to unbearable levels.  I'm 17 weeks now and everything is great.
BabyBumps X HAHAHAHA I LOVE your shirt! My youngest we called Tribble until we found out she was a girl... my cousin (about the only other one who had a clue what it meant) said to be careful or I'd jinx myself into twins or more.
BabyBumps X I had mine today and Urine, heartbeat, measuring. Mine starts internal checks at 38 weeks. 
TwoXChromosomes X If it's the combo pill, you're perfectly ok. If it's the progestin only pill, use a back up method because the half-life of progestin only pills is way shorter.
BabyBumps X I never felt fluttering.  I've felt pushes, kicks, and rolling over.  The pushes could be described as a bubble popping on the surface though.  It's a bit odd feeling but awesome at the same time.  My sister described her first pregnancy saying the movements are like a can of worms.  "Thanks sis, now I can't help but think worms now instead of a cute baby :P"
TwoXChromosomes X At least I get a choice. If I were to get pregnant these days, despite being on birth control, I could chain my partner to me financially for the next twenty years. Despite having done what we thought was necessary to prevent pregnancy, despite the fact that he can't afford it, he's a student, but it would of course be my choice. If he wanted to have the baby, it doesn't matter. If he doesn't want to have the baby, it still doesn't matter. I can do whatever I want in that scenario and he has no choice but to go along with what I want to do. I don't think its fair that's all. Imagine if the tables were turned and someone else got to decide if you had a baby or not (as is happening right now), what happens to your life, your plans, all those things that you wanted for yourself disappear. At least I can decide to get an abortion, and I absolutely would if I ever needed to.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;You only have to use a back-up method for most pills when you miss three days or more.   That is dangerously untrue. If you miss a pill (take it an entire day late) you're at an increased risk of pregnancy. If you miss two pills you are at a higher risk of pregnancy, etc. The [Yaz packet insert]( ) recommends using a backup method if you miss two days. ~~And you are NOT supposed to double dose if you miss two or more pills. The only time you do that is if you take one pill late - you take it as soon as you remember and then take your next pill at the regular time.~~
BabyBumps X I think it's the baby! I started feeling my baby at around 20 weeks. I have an anterior placenta (so it's in the front) and her movements were muffled. At first they felt like someone was tickling me gently from the inside. Now they're much stronger and they feel exactly like gas pops. I woke up one morning at 3am and I thought I had extreme gas.... nope! Just her popping around in there :) enjoy it; it's an amazing feeling. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't have cysts, but I have endometriosis and hypothyroidism. Going off b/c really helped my thyroid problems, by my gyno bitches at me about it every visit. It's up to you to figure out how you function best. Your doctors should be there to give you advice and trust that you are the expert on your body. 
TwoXChromosomes X I masterbate all the time. Same thing build up until it it too intense and I can't keep going. Feels like I'm gonna explode.
BabyBumps X I never could distinguish the early movements. I felt the same with the "maybe it's just gas" because, let's face it, pregnancy makes you gassy. Then one day I felt something new and it was like "that HAS to be the baby because I've never felt THAT before". You'll know eventually what is baby and what isn't. And then you'll REALLY know and SEE baby move. It's pretty effing cool. 
BabyBumps X I kept a lot of my weight until babes stopped breast feeding, 9 months later.  Then it just dropped off. 
BabyBumps X The first time I really felt sure I was feeling the baby move was at 17 weeks and it felt like bubbles popping really low. Reminded me kind of like bubbles floating up and popping in a glass of coke. Lol As the weeks passed it graduated to the fluttering feeling...then sharper nudges....and now very noticeable kicks that I'm starting to feel more and more from the outside.
BabyBumps X &gt;Anyone have an idea how soon I might loose my plug at this point??  Any time between now and when baby is born. Heck, I've been losing mine for weeks now...  Keep in mind, losing your plug is not at all a sign of labor!
BabyBumps X As MaeBeWeird said, losing your plug isn't really a sign of labor :( Unless it's there is blood mixed in, then *usually* it's an indication that labor will happen within 72 hours. I lost my plug at 35 weeks and never went into labor naturally :/ But yay for things moving in general! 
Parenting X This is why you call 911. Granted, it may take a few minutes for the ambulance to get there, but once they do they are equipped for pediatric emergencies (such as the pediatric intubation kit). 
BabyBumps X On the nipples: you might very well have yeast. That's EXACTLY what a yeast infection feels like. Paint them with gentian violet (totally preggo safe, although it'll turn them purple),  oh, every day or so and see if it doesn't make it masssively bettter in a bout 4 days.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;it shouldn't bother you to see a baby drinking from a breast.  I don't know so much about that. Drinking from a bottle is a lot less intimate than having its face smooshed right up against your chest. Its just how I see it. Also, seeing a stranger's breast, for people who are generally uncomfortable about nudity, well it can be hard to associate that bare boob with being a mother if you could care less about kids.  And -- yeah this is a stretch -- some women who can't have babies might get upset about seeing that in public.. But thats the only REAL reason I could imagine banning it anywhere. (Like I said - not against it, I'm just one of those people who will go far away from you when you're doing it).  My personal opinion is that mothers should be a little more sensitive to what people do and don't want to see in public. Breastfeeding (to me) is a little more explicit than gay people holding hands. But I'm not trying to argue with you here at all, it is your right as a mom.  &gt;Especially since this has been recognized as a legal right in most states.  Are you also protected if you bare your breast completely in a store/eatery? Or does the store/eatery have the right to ask you to leave? 
BabyBumps X You aren't your friends. And an ultrasound won't tell you if your water is going to break early, at all.  It's totally normal not to do an ultrasound until 18 weeks or later, and many insurances will only cover that one unless others are actually medically necessary. The only medical ultrasound I got my entire pregnancy was at 18 weeks, then I went at 27 and got a 3D done on my own.  I personally wouldn't do a 3D ultrasound until the third trimester, when you actually get pictures of baby looking like baby is going to look, in the second trimester they haven't put any fat on yet and that makes them look weird.
BabyBumps X at the ultrasound itself it was even more visible as the technician zoomed in and out...  My doctor had told me a week before that I would be able to see her face really well and I was like meh... boy, was I wrong! 
TwoXChromosomes X As a childless by choice woman I think women should be able to breastfeed where they want, kids get hungry and that's what boobs were kinda made for.  I would much rather the baby be getting fed than screaming and crying because they're hungry...puritanism is so weird..
BabyBumps X All doctors have an "on call" doctor.  No one person can be there 99% or 100% of the time.  Most doctors practice in a group, and they rotate who is on call and they sometimes have their patients have appointments with each of the docs in the practice so you can meet them.  If your doctor is in a solo practice, they might try to do as many of their own deliveries as they can, but ultimately doctors are people with lives and can't always make it, so they tend to work with hospitalists or another solo practice.    I think you were probably wrong in your thinking that your old doctor had a 99% chance of delivering your baby.  Unless he lived at the hospital and never needed to eat or sleep, it's just not possible.  Anyway, my point is that you need to realize that no matter who you see, there is a good chance that s/he won't get to deliver your baby.  If you  don't like the setup of your current practice, it's definitely not too late to switch, but if you're going try to go to a solo practice, they might be full for your due date month.  (I actually looked into that during my second pregnancy at 5 months and ran into that problem).  So you might want to try to find a smaller group practice where you get to meet all the doctors ahead of time.
TwoXChromosomes X This is baffling. You're ok with women having their breasts exposed in public. You're ok with babies drinking from bottles in public. What is it about breastfeeding that you find disgusting?
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah they said if it had ruptured she would have had internal bleeding and would need emergency care so it's good it was spotted earlier. Thanks you so much!
TwoXChromosomes X If stretch marks are tiger stripes, what is cellulite?
BabyBumps X I know a lady that just had her baby in the car. She also had a short labor the first time. On the other hand, of my mother in law's two sons, one was caught by the nurse 15 minutes after they got to the hospital, the other was a 39 hour labor that ended in a forceps delivery because he was stuck so bad (in the early 80's).   Honestly though, I would probably risk it. Is there anything closer that you could go to in an emergency, like if you were feeling the need to push?   Being induced because you live far away just sounds like a bit much for them to ask of you
BabyBumps X I know what you mean! I've been watching my belly push out half an inch or so in places for the last few weeks. Tonight she was kicking by my ribs so much while we were watching Star Trek (the original series awwww yeah!) that I grabbed my husband's hand and smooshed it over the spot she was kicking.  He was shocked at how hard she was able to kick his hand.  Now he understands a bit why I yelp when she gets me in the ribs, especially the fractured one.
BabyBumps X I felt mine start up around the same time as you.  I've used it to figure out which way she's laying in my belly, and the dr. confirmed my suspicion when I was there a week ago (head by left hip, butt by right ribs).
TwoXChromosomes X A word to the wise: HIV tests, depending on the type, aren't accurate til 3 or 6 months after exposure; herpes tests (which you have to request specifically, and you should) are accurate about 3 or 4 months after exposure. Get tested.   Keep having fun, but please use protection! &lt;3
BabyBumps X Remember your "pain tolerance" cannot be compared w birth... Being injured, such as your burn, is an unnatural, traumatic experience for your body.  However, your body was made for labor. It's not something being done to your body, it is a natural process.  Sorry I know a little off topic, but just wanted to throw that out there. I think every woman can do it. It's your choice. I would, however, choose a different doctor. Can you go to a birth center w  midwives?
TwoXChromosomes X I know plenty of people who use condoms to suck cock. I was just saying being exclusive doesn't give more than an illusion of safety with your partner and that sex isn't always just babies.
TwoXChromosomes X If you take your pills as directed (the same time every day and don't miss a day not counting your inactive pills) you should be fine.
TwoXChromosomes X I think that's what she means - some pills are in 21-day packs, where you just wait 7 days before starting the next pack, instead of taking the placebo pills (because there are no placebo pills in those packs).
BabyBumps X Mine was an accident.  I was told 10 months prior to conception that I couldn't get pregnant due to my problems with my ovaries.  I was still taking the pill so I had a monthly period, but I guess it didn't work one month and well.... now I've got a little munchkin in my belly. I couldn't of planned it, though if I'm honest I do wish it wouldn't of happened quite so soon.
BabyBumps X Congrats!!! I have my ultrasound on Wednesday the 16th to find out the sex. We all think it's a boy so we'll see :) 
BabyBumps X I lost my mucus plug and my water broke 24 hours later. Good luck!
BabyBumps X Ohhh, you look amazing!!!  I've been so bloated for a while making my bump look like it was bigger and above my belly button, but the bloat disappeared yesterday.  I felt too tiny.  I guess either way I won't be completely satisfied, haha.
BabyBumps X Everyone has their own pain tolerance and their own preference.  I knew going in I wanted the epidural.  I liked it because I was able to be calm and focus better.  But I had no desire to specifically try for a med free birth.  If that's what you want, then go for it!  There are other types of pain meds you can try other than an epidural as well.  Ask your doctor/midwife about those options.
BabyBumps X Epidural slows labor. Then you need pitocin. Then pitocin can create fetal distress (it can elevate the fetus's heartrate). 
BabyBumps X Sometimes it does, intervention leads to intervention. You get induced with pitocin, which makes the contractions too strong to handle, which leads to getting an epidural, which if given too early can halt your labor so you don't progress, leading to more pitocin, or the old "failure to progress" so you end up with a c section. 
BabyBumps X Hmm. Well, if you really don't mind giving birth far away (the main thing I'd worry about is what if there were complications, and baby and/or I got stuck in the hospital for days or weeks, and husband had to leave to go home to work and I was alone, or something), then I'd say go for it! It's only 48 hrs, after all.
BabyBumps X I bled the entire first trimester, and freaked out every time I saw red. Just try to stay calm and remember that even if you do miscarry, it just means the baby was missing something really important, like a brain.
BabyBumps X False positives definitely happen all the time, that's why I avoided the blood test (my OB actually doesn't even offer it unless you specifically ask because of the high false positives.  She just asks if you want the amnio).  I knew I would not risk an amnio because of the risk of miscarriage, and I would not abort anyway so I chose not to worry myself over a possibility of a false positive for the rest of the pregnancy. I know there was someone on here just a little bit ago who had a positive blood test with really high chances (I think it was around 1:26) and I'm pretty sure after her further testing she found out her baby was just fine.  Sending my best wishes your way hun. &lt;3
TwoXChromosomes X My first gyno exam was when I was 22, and I was scared out of my mind.  There was an intern who held my hand while I cried during the exam.  I wish your experience would have been better.
BabyBumps X When I was 40+ weeks people still didn't believe me that I was preggers, and those who did believe told me I was going to have a small baby because I had the tiniest little bump. Little man came out 7lbs 3 oz. 
BabyBumps X ...and every *pregnancy* is different.  If you have a second child, maybe an epidural won't be 'needed'  My labor was very intense and I could hardly stand being in my own skin, the epidural was heaven for me.  *If* I ever have a second child (big "if"), then I'll go the same route: Start with an open mind and only ask if I feel that it's absolutely needed.
TwoXChromosomes X I leave tampons in longer than 6 hours regularly and have never had any problems, but I usually give the ol vag a break at night with a pad.
BabyBumps X I swear my little monkey pushed off my ribs with her pokey little toes to head butt my bladder as hard as she could the other day. I nearly wet myself. And she also does something that feels like little pinches to one of my ribs...  WTH causes that?  In my head, I picture little lobster claws but I'm pretty sure that's not it.....  And I still love feeling her move so much. :)
BabyBumps X i think it's unreasonable to ask a mother to hide away when she breastfeeds like it's something to be ashamed of. have you ever tried to nurse in a bathroom or a car? and i couldn't keep a blanket on my shoulder if i tried - she invariably kicks it off. i most recently breastfed in one of those armchairs in the open area in front of a mall department store, nobody cared.   i'm not saying i should be free to whip off my shirt or leave my whole tit hanging out for 5 minutes while i get her situated - i still do my best to keep my nipple concealed by her head and most of my breast covered by my shirt. but i also think it's insensitive to laugh about a woman breastfeeding "with one jug all the way out," because i don't have perky 20-year-old breasts where i can peek just the nipple out of my nursing bra - in order to get it in the right position and give her enough to latch onto, i do have to take my whole boob out of the bra. if that bothers someone, that's their problem - they need to grow up. i'm not ashamed of my breasts and they don't need to be ashamed for me.
BabyBumps X I coworker told me today that the extreme fatigue I am experiencing while pregnant is 'a cakewalk' compared to how tired I will be home with an infant. Made me wanna cry. :(. 
BabyBumps X I disagree. While it can be tiresome to be postpartum, if it is that bad you want to get checked out for thyroid or iron issues, or nap more at the very least.  My first, it *was* that bad, turned out I had postpartum thyroiditis. Was put on synthyroid and got better little by little until we got my prescription to the right strength.
BabyBumps X Aw, everyone looks so pretty! I can't wait to show my bump off when I finally start showing.. :3
BabyBumps X Right, this is 5hours old so I hope the issue is resolved but what kind of pains are we talking about?  Cramping could be gas pains, which can be awful. Pains from constipation, which can be horrific too.   Galbladder pain is usually in the upper right side under your ribs, and can also come with nausea.    
BabyBumps X 32 hours from water breaking to baby for me.  I started having regular contractions 5 minutes after my water broke.  Good luck!! Excited for you :)
BabyBumps X I have an irritable uterus so this happened to me a ton before labor actually started so I'm no help but I can give you much sympathy. I know how much it sucks to start thinking it's time only for it to stop!  Good luck, it's just a matter of days, if that, before your baby finally comes!
BabyBumps X I didn't get morning sickness until 8 weeks with my first. There are a lucky 15% or so of women with healthy pregnancies that just don't get sick. Maybe you're one of the lucky ones. I know it's hard, but I would try not to worry for now.
BabyBumps X Comes and goes. Developed symptoms around seven weeks. Last week, the smell of anything made me sick. This week, I just want to sleep all the time. So, you're fine. I still don't feel pregnant and I have like, two weeks left in my first trimester.
AskWomen X I went off the pill after it destroyed my sex drive, and it took me a really long time to get the drive back as it was. I would not go on hormonal BC again, and the IUD idea makes me really uncomfortable, especially given the kinds of complications that are possible. My SO and I use condoms combined with an awareness of my cycle and of his pulling out abilities (which are uniformly reliable and stellar - don't do this if your SO does not have ironclad self control, and remember to pee before sex to minimize the risk of sperm in precum).
BabyBumps X Depends on the class and on the birth experience you want.  Hospital based classes are generally good for women who want to show up at the hospital and get an epidural. They don't always teach you how to deal with contractions without pain meds.  There are other birth classes out there for moms who want a natural labor.  They don't always have to be a "Bradley" or "Lamaze" class. I know a number of instructors in my area who do a more holistic type of childbirth class. These classes give you techniques to cope with labor, things like trying position changes, breathing, etc.  There are also classes out there that go over prenatal education and talk about different things that may come up during pregnancy, and talk about different procedures for you and your baby, help you write a birth plan, teach labor techniques, and then also have a class or two on breastfeeding, diapering, and more post-partum stuff.   So, depending on what you want to get out of the class, you may need to look around for different classes, or piece classes together.  Some classes are a one-day thing. Some are are once a week for 12 weeks. Just look into what you want and then check around your area.  As far as if it's worth it or not... that's up to you. If it's your first baby and you want a natural birth, I think it's worth it to educate yourself on what will be happening with your body and ways you can cope with it. It's also sometimes nice to have a time once a week where you and your partner can focus on baby things and where your partner can learn how to help you cope as well. Knowledge is power.  Also, if you're planning to have a doula at your birth, she might offer a lot of the same stuff a childbirth class does.  Just look into it and try to find something that works for you.
BabyBumps X I am one mo from my due date today, and we are on our way to L&amp;D due to decreased fetal movement. We have a hospital bag, but little else ready. Fingers crossed baby is not on his way out today! Omg!
AskWomen X Not to freak you out but 1 in 4 women carry genital herpes.  Something like 80% don't know it.  People need to be checked more as it's not in standard STD testing typically - it needs to be requested on its own.
BabyBumps X I'm the opposite, I've had B-H for weeks (put on bedrest for three weeks until I got to term) and have been having slightly painful ones since then, 8-10 minutes apart...but not progressing. Crampy, backache, starving then sick to my stomach, etc...but baby is just messing with me apparently (also feels like he is trying to break out on his own). Its getting frustrating, in spite of originally planning to be pregnant for a few more weeks. Good luck, hope the babies cooperate for mothers day :) 
TwoXChromosomes X Ive done it. I was fine, Until about two weeks before my next period was supposed to happen. it decided it wasn't going to wait any longer and I perioded heavily until I took the 1 week break and started a new pack. No mood issues.  If this happens to you, just stop taking the pills for a week and start your new pack early. 
AskWomen X I started my period when I was 11, and I started using tampons when I was in middle school, maybe around 13. I was terrified of them. One day my class went on a field-trip to the zoo, and I started my period without having any pads with me. A girlfriend gave me a tampon, and I just sort of sucked it up and used it. It doesn't feel like anything at all once it's in, and you do forget about it. The main thing is to angle it slightly up towards your tail bone (since the vagina is tilted that way) and relax your muscles as you put it in, that way it goes in easy without issue.   I haven't used pads that much since that field-trip, I love tampons. Pads make me feel gross, and they irritate my skin.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine a year and I pretty much never need tampons or even panty liners. I only know I'm on my period when I wipe. It's amazing.
AskWomen X A woman can get pregnant when she ovulates. Many cycles differ but most ovulation occurs 14 days after onset of menstruation. Due to the ability of sperm to live in a body and the natural variation of ovulation times the three days on each side of an ovulation are most likely to be fertile times. Only one sperm is required to fertilize an egg. It is all about the timing. Women's cycles differ in duration but that is the rule of thumb for a 28 and 1/2 day cycle. Most of the rest of the month she could bang a battalion and not get pregnant. There are always exceptions though. Many catholics have practiced the rhythm method for generations as birth control. That means a woman takes note of her body's natural ovulation rhythm and foregoes coitus during her fertile times. But you know what they call women who practice the rhythm method? Mothers. 
BabyBumps X I am not far enough along to tell you about me yet... but I saw my cousin when she was at about 8 months.  Hers was still quite the innie.  She never got very big for any of her pregnancies.  She has a long torso, so her bump never made it to "planet'size" and her belly button never became an outie.  I am curious what will happen with me.  I am tall and wide-hipped, but fairly short in the torso.  I would rather not have my belly button flip out...
TwoXChromosomes X What exactly was too tense? If it was the cervix she should examine you After Ovulation. If it's Stil too tense then there is medicine you can Take to temporarily widen it. But if she does Not know all this Stuff you should Look for a different doctor. 
AskWomen X The notion of a 28 day cycle with ovulation on the 14th day is an extremely antiquated and narrow view of female fertility, and in most cases, does not apply. Rhythm method does, in fact, suck, but FAM and NFP (the only difference between the two is how the couple treats fertile days) can be extremely accurate as long as the woman takes a few minutes a day to listen to her body. Every woman has a different cycle length, and by no means does every woman ovulate halfway through her cycle. 
AskWomen X This is partly correct. Sperm can live inside of a woman for up to five days, but ONLY if she is in her fertile window, and therefor producing fertile-quality cervical fluid. If the cervical fluid isn't the right quality, the sperm will die within a few hours of ejaculation. If the cervical fluid is in fact fertile-quality though, and the woman has not yet ovulated (so it would probably be within 3-4 days or so of ovulation), then there is a chance of fertilization. The egg is only viable for about 18 hours after it's released from the ovary though, so add all of those variables together, and you get a relatively small window of time during which a woman can achieve pregnancy. 
TwoXChromosomes X i was 19 when i found out i was pregnant with my first one, and i found out i was pregnant again when my oldest was two months old.
BabyBumps X I spotted from just before 4 weeks until 10 weeks.  I was an absolute mess because I'd had 3 previous miscarriages.  However, with the m/c, each one started within a day or two of the spotting.  I had a few early ultrasounds with this pregnancy confirming the heartbeat.  Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;ts become quite a bad habit of mine to skip periods, I know I shouldn't do it regularly but I do  It is perfectly safe to skip your period regularly.
AskWomen X Well, i start mine when i was 11-ish, but only used pads. I started using tampons after i had sex since i have always been nervous about inserting things up there (because of pain, discomfort... fear), but once i knew that it wasn't bad i just started using the.  * You can't feel them once they're in properly, so i wouldn't worry about that.  * Change them regularly- especially since you have a heavy flow, they tend to leak if you leave them in for too long. Also, in case of that TSS thing.  * Start small. It'll be easier to insert them.  * Have a happy period. **shudder*
TwoXChromosomes X When I was pregnant I felt movement like you were describing between 16-20weeks. However everyone is different when it comes that, so it really isn't a very good way to judge.  If you can think back to your last normal period, as I'm sure it would have been fairly different from the spotting you experienced that is probably the best way to confirm on your own. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just want to give you some hope. A bubbly feeling in your abdomen can be an early pregnancy sign too. Also, I said earlier, but every woman is different. I ONLY gained weight early on (and then retained water about a week before delivery). If you are bleeding fresh blood, that is not a good sign as far as pregnancies go. Of course I am not suggesting that you skip the doctor, but the things that you describe can be miscarriage symptoms. (Especially the brown blood turning to fresh blood). I would describe the feelings I had in my uterus before my miscarriage as "twinges" not painful, but noticeable.   I would really try to get in earlier. Bleeding in pregnancy is common, but it is not normal. If it were me, I would want to make sure that the pregnancy was in the uterus and was not in the tubes or anything that would cause you to bleed (especially if you are further along, bleeding can be a bad sign for YOUR health, not just the fetus).  If your bleed becomes heavy (soaking 1 pad an hour...don't use tampons right now, you could get an infection), or you experience one sided pain, or extreme pain, go to the ER.
TwoXChromosomes X I NEVER start on the first day I take the sugar pill. It's always two or three days late and I always take my pill on time. I've come to the conclusion that my body is a troll. So I wouldn't freak out if I was you. :] 
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on the type of birth control pill you have. Some pills are monophasic, meaning the doses of hormones are the same in each pills. Other pills are multiphasic (I've heard of bi- and tri-phasics) and contain different hormone levels in certain periods of time.  If you're on a monophasic pill, your protection should stay the same no matter which pill you take. If your pill is bi or triphasic, then you'd probably be wise to use backup protection or hold off on sex until you can get back on track. (That's if you use birth control for pregnancy prevention, though!)   (Someone who knows more about birth control can elaborate on this if I haven't gotten it 100%.)
TwoXChromosomes X Yeast is actually all over your body, and you can get a yeast infection *anywhere*.  I remember reading a post once from someone who had a chronic yeast skin condition that did not sound fun at all.  However, the most common places that people get yeast infections are the throat and genitals.  When you get it in your throat, it's commonly called thrush.  Uncircumsized guys can get yeast infections in their foreskins, and you can pass it back and forth between partners.    Your normal vaginal yeast population should be kept in check by bacteria.  However, when you go on antibiotics, you kill off some of those good bacteria and a yeast overgrowth can happen.  Your doctor will be able to diagnose it the same way s/he can diagnose BV, by looking at a microscope slide of your vaginal fluid.    Personally, I find that the symptoms of a yeast infection and BV are very similar.  They're both itchy, change the smell of my pee, and cause me to have sweet-smelling (but in a bad way) white discharge.  Sometimes my yeast infections are external and I'll notice that I have a recurring whitish film on my vulva.  Other women find that they smell strongly of bread and have a lot of really chunky discharge during yeast infections.  
TwoXChromosomes X Can I ask which pill you were on? I've had nearly the same problems as you and I just stopped taking mine a few days ago.
TwoXChromosomes X I have minera.  My doc warned that copper ones would make me bleed like crazy.   Do you know if you can try it out, then have it removed after a few months if it m akes you bleed too much or is it kinda in there for the 12 years?
TwoXChromosomes X I have but I can't remember if that was the one I reacted so badly to. The first bc my dr put me one gave me my period for a month and a half straight until finally he changed me to something different. I'll have to check with my dr whether that was the progestrin only pill.  Thanks!
TwoXChromosomes X I've had Implanon for about 9 months and so far I really liked it. At first I had breakthrough spotting but after a while it's evened out. I've had friends who got it who had serious issues with the spotting but mine has stopped completely and when I have my periods they are extremely light.  
TwoXChromosomes X I've taken two different types of birth control.  One made me throw up uncontrollably after the 2nd pill, and the one I'm currently on (Yaz) hasn't changed me at all.
TwoXChromosomes X That's really good to know :-) I first went on the pill because of the awful cramps and heavy periods so I'll have to prepare for those. If my sex drive comes back my boyfriend will be very happy though, haha.
BabyBumps X Exhaustion lasts throughout pregnancy unfortunately. During my first pregnancy, my morning sickness did not kick in until about 13 to 14 weeks which made my second trimester miserable.
BabyBumps X Yup. The FOREVER has started to eat into my brain as well. I'm mostly excited but still have moments of sheer terror.
BabyBumps X Don't stress too much about the antibiotics...if they are being prescribed it means the benefits outweigh the risks. Infections can get really bad when not treated.  I was on antibiotics for a UTI around 7 weeks... better to treat a UTI than get a kidney infection.
TwoXChromosomes X I went on the patch (Evra) when I kept forgetting to take the pill. There is also a jab you can get 4 times a year called Depo. Try /r/birthcontrol.
TwoXChromosomes X How long have you had your IUD? I have hormonal issues myself and though I'm quite happy with the Mirena it would be very liberating to go completely off hormonal birth control. I think I was just a bit freaked out about the copper IUD. But that was two years ago and I'm currently transitioning to a more natural and organic lifestyle. 
TwoXChromosomes X I got the DivaCup, and while I had little problems getting it in there, I quickly realized it was too long for me. Pushed all the way up and over my cervix, even with the stem trimmed, it still protruded during wear and was as a result, somewhat uncomfortable.   You can keep experimenting with it and you may have better luck.But if all else fails, there are a variety of menstrual cups out there in different sizes.
TwoXChromosomes X A GP is a General Practioner, it's just my usual doctor. I don't think we have specific gynos here - if I wanted to see one I think I would have to go through my GP first anyway to get referred but generally I think either he or someone else there would chat to me about them. I'm only 20 so things like breast exams and smear tests aren't really available to me very easily. I think the minimum requirement age wise is about 25 but I would have to check that myself sometime. Thanks for your help!
AskWomen X Call and check with your doctor, but I'm pretty sure you're ok. Missing pills is a bigger deal than starting late... But seriously, check with your doctor ASAP, and use a backup method until she confirms! Better safe than sorry.
TwoXChromosomes X I just read your update. I hope this puts you a little more at ease because you weren't that out of tune with your body. Early miscarriages are very common (roughly around 25% of all pregnancies I think) - if you were 7 weeks along and still pregnant there should have been a sack visible on the ultrasound. Since there was bleeding then a miscarriage probably explains it. I realize you still need to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, but its safe to say you weren't anywhere near the 16 weeks that you were concerned about.   Hopefully your hormone levels will have dropped when you go back, and you wont have to worry about it anymore. ((hugs))
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds like you're right. I don't think states ban abortion before 20 weeks, I think it's just hard to find someone who will actually perform it. PP does not perform abortions after around 13 weeks or so.
BabyBumps X It doesn't mean *nothing.*  I'm at 41 weeks today, 0% effaced, 0cm dilated. What it means is that if I get induced, which is looking pretty darn likely, I'll likely end up with a C-section because I have an "unfavorable cervix."  I couldn't even get my membranes swept yesterday because my cervix was so tight.   So call me jealous :).
TwoXChromosomes X Exactly. Every method of BC is different and every woman reacts differently. I had the mini pill before I switched to the IUD and though the hormone in both is exactly the same, because of the localisation and lower dose I feel much better with the IUD. 
Parenting X I had told my 2 kids (at the time they were 3 and 1.5) that we were going to go to the hospital to get them a new baby brother to get them ready for the new baby. We brought him home (and mind you, both kids had come to the hospital a few hours after I gave birth to see him) but a couple days later had to go to the clinic for his first check-up. As I put him in the car seat, my 3 year old asked me if I was finally going to take him back to the hospital because she had wanted a baby sister, not a baby brother. 
BabyBumps X If you don't mind me asking, how did you make it to 17 days late? They realllly wanted to induce me at 41, and I'm scheduled for induction at 42...
Parenting X We just had our three year old in the room with us for the first ultrasound.  I showed her the screen and asked if she thought their looked like a boy or girl (too early to tell but I thought it would make for good conversation with her).  She looked at it for half a second and said "A turtle". Had the whole room laughing their asses off.  We call the fetus turtle to this day. 
BabyBumps X I used a group of midwives and I warned them ahead of time that I expected to go late again (my mom was also a long gestationer).  They mentioned it once at 41 weeks that they'd ask me about it at 42 weeks.  At 42 weeks they suggested I get induced and were sure I'd be a good candidate, but I just said I wanted to wait a few more days.  They finally did talk me into scheduling the induction 2 days later, then I went into labor and popped her out 3 hours before I was scheduled to arrive at the hospital anyway, haha
BabyBumps X My husband and I have had out names picked out for almost two years. We were totally set on both a girl and a boy name. We found out we are having a boy and have since decided we hated the boy name and have gone with something different (still one of our top 10 though). 
Parenting X I don't know what test you took, but if it is the blood test, where they look for fetal markers in the mother's blood, then these are notoriously unreliable. The only method for confirming with certainty is to sample cells from the baby and do a karyotype. This is most readily accomplished through an amniocentesis, so they take a sample of the placenta which has the same genetic makeup as the baby. Then they take a picture of the chromosomes and physically line them up to count. This will tell you if one is missing or if there is an extra one (trisomy, three instead of two). The blood test is no where near as reliable.   I also don't want to give you false hope, 99% sounds like a pretty strong number. The one example I know is a friend of mine who was diagnosed as having down's syndrome. When she got her PhD her mother was tempted to send it to the doctor who "diagnosed" her and suggested termination.
BabyBumps X I highly recommend learning to swaddle. I already knew how b/c of my niece and nephew but my husband didn't so I had him watch [this video]( ?v=kykSRRZCzS0). They also have videos on other newborn care topics. I think it was very helpful for him. Good luck! 
BabyBumps X I remember the disappointment I felt when I hit 40 weeks and NOTHING happened. I had to be induced at 41+3 because I wasn't making any progress and my doctor didn't want me to make it to 42. OY... I hope you go into labor soon!
TwoXChromosomes X It's not so much false as *outdated* information. Contemporary IUDs are perfectly safe for nulliparous (never gave birth) women who don't have any health-related contraindications - usually that's stuff like STIs or pelvic inflammation. You *do* stand a notably higher chance of spontaneously expelling the IUD than a woman who has given birth, but it's not dangerous; you just won't be protected.  [Source 1 (Reuters quoting the CDC)]( -doctors-iud-idUSBRE82Q17J20120327)  [Source 2 (nusringcenter.com)]( _article.asp?tid=1139964)
BabyBumps X If you get that sharp pain from moving quickly and it goes away after a short amount of time that sounds like RLP to me.  I started getting it around 13 weeks and brought it up at my 14 week appointment. Your uterus does start growing pretty fast right away.  Pre-pregnancy, your uterus is about the size of your fist.  By week 8 your uterus is already the size of an orange, and by week 10 the size of a grapefruit.  So that's a lot of stretching and rearranging that your lower abdomen has to go through.  It's normal for your ligaments to get a little sore- even this early. :)
BabyBumps X Lol at semiorgasmic labor. Yeah, that was so not my experience.   I had working contractions at around 11am. They got steadily stronger until transition at around 2. Baby was born at 4, twenty minutes of pushing. I shrieked once, when I tore perineally. Other than that, low low moaning got through it.
BabyBumps X But I could also be false labor. Which I had those things a few weeks ago. Patterns and progression, blood, any leaking fluid or if your start vomiting go in for sure!
TwoXChromosomes X Honestly, I went through this. I tried a few different pills (keep in mind each time you switch pills it can take your body a few months to adjust, thus you might spot during this time.) but eventually I said, F this, and got on depo. I've been period free for two years, and am quite happy :)
BabyBumps X [Relevant]( _report_kris_cowan/2012/05/best-states-for-working-moms.html) - I saw this on my FB feed today.  I think it's disgusting how the US handles maternity leave, we seriously need a change.  7wks on Short Term Disability was *not* enough time with my newborn!  Sure, I'm fortunate that family watches my baby during the week, but it's still not fair.
BabyBumps X My intuition sucks. LOL I thought I was having a boy...so positive that I even bought a cute blue onesie. But, we had the gender ultrasound today and it is a GIRL! My husband and I are still in shock. LOL 
BabyBumps X I definitely wanted to, but my doctor refused to induce before at least 10 days overdue (and if your cervix wasn't favorable they waited until 42 weeks) unless there was a medical reason. I'm not sure most doctor would induce for that reason :/ 
TwoXChromosomes X I stopped masturbating because of this same issue.  I would masturbate when I was young and when I eventually started having sex, I could not "peak".  I eventually got frustrated enough and just swore off masturbating and just had sex.  A lot.  I came once from just penetration alone.  Now I masturbate occasionally but I try to focus more on g-spot stimulation instead of clitoral stimulation.  When I have sex with my SO, I usually have to have clitoral stimulation to climax.  When you masturbate, try pushing out instead of clenching in.  [you know, when the big O starts to come on, you want to clench down tightly, instead push out and ride it through.  Totally different experience.  May take a couple of tries to master]  I have no scientific evidence but IMO this gets more blood flowing down there which makes everything MUCH more sensitive.  Be warned, this has the potential to turn you into a squirter :P  This really worked for me, I suggest you at least give it a try for awhile :/
BabyBumps X Ooo Yay! I am still nervous about my current pregnancy. Last pregnancy I miscarried at 6 weeks 2 days. I am currently at 5 weeks 1 day. I am so hoping this one is viable.   Congrats on your little one! So happy for you. :)
TwoXChromosomes X Pregnancy has many health effects on the body, including potentially some serious complications. Preventing that is absolutely a medical and health issue.  Medication can also be to *prevent* a condition, not just to treat it.
Parenting X Just kinda want to point this out - Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the throat. Strep is a short name for the bacteria (*Streptococcus pyogenes* or Group A Strep) that is most likely to be causing the inflammation.
TwoXChromosomes X You're perfectly normal, and... for what it's worth that happens to guys. Every once in awhile you get a dud where you clearly orgasm but it's muted or not-so-great.   Actually the "worst" orgasm, when you're a guy is when things get unhitched. Even though they seem to be wedded together, orgasm and ejaculation are two separate things. You can ejaculate without orgasm and you can orgasm without ejaculating. When things get unhitched in a good way... you can bang out a couple orgasms  before you ejaculate, and that's *awesome*. When things get unhitched in a bad way... it's like your penis goes on auto-pilot and explodes everywhere, sans orgasm. That's no fun. 
TwoXChromosomes X Honestly, it's actually pretty great. I get it once every three months, and I have two whole months of absolutely no period. The downside is the last month is usually a solid month of light spotting, which is sort of a pain, but depending on who you are and what your normal period is like, it can be worth it. It did make me gain some weight, but only because I was a little hungrier than usual for the first 2 rounds.  Personally I'm getting off it because I can't handle the one month of light spotting, but if you have a horrible heavy period with cramps, PMS, and what-not, I really recommend depo. Get it for period control, not birth control. But just know that when you start it, you can't "stop" until three+ months have passed... (Just my 2 cents)
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not even talking about just for non-contraceptive reasons, although those are great examples. Hormones for birth control have been fantastic for a lot of women. The fact that some women have bad reactions doesn't mean that hormone birth control is inherently bad, just that it isn't for everyone--just like every single prescription medicine out there.
TwoXChromosomes X [Yep. Read this]( -up-moms-youre-fighting-the-wrong-fight/)   A friend of mine has to save up vacation time and sick leave to get it to 8 weeks leave. So then what happens if she gets sick or the baby gets sick after her 8 week leave? She is sorta screwed. Also, then too she has used all of her vacation leave, soo no vacation time off for that first year after having her baby. Also, she works for a federally funded state job. Crappy Crappy time off for sure.   
TwoXChromosomes X I am in my early 20's now. I firmly believe that it is MY choice. I am someone who enjoys MY life. I would like to have children, AT MY OWN time. Not When Society says I HAVE to have children. I know that abortion should not be taken lightly, but if I was ever in that position. I would do it.  
TwoXChromosomes X The employer doesn't necessarily foot that 6 weeks off,  it is often UNPAID.  The employer only has to deal with 6 weeks with one fewer employee (and they aren't supposed to fire her for it).  
TwoXChromosomes X thank you for saying that.  i hate that this has become an issue, and i hate even more the way we're defending our use of birth control as purely a health issue.  preventing pregnancy is valid, healthy, moral, and nothing to be ashamed of.  you don't have to justify your use of birth control by explaining your irregular, heavy periods.  if you have irregular heavy periods and birth control helps, awesome!  i'm so glad there's a medication that helps.  but it's okay to have that little dial in your drawer or purse or pocket simply and purely to ensure you don't get knocked up.
BabyBumps X Great to hear.  Just take it with a grain of salt.  Our son was at a high risk of down syndrome due to enlarged kidneys.  It was a major deal as they said his kidneys may not function and that there would be "permanent and irreversible damage."  You know what?  No down syndrome, and he's going to have a little surgery June 8th to fix a blockage.  It all works out in the end.
BabyBumps X I'm having my first one on Monday at 20 weeks. I, too, thought it was uncool to have to wait so long, but the good news is they aren't worried about you or the kiddo if they aren't pushing for one already. If you know conception dates (we did) and aren't worried about eptopic pregnancy or miscarriage than it's ok to not have the early ones! 
TwoXChromosomes X Well, my insurance company only covers generics, so any brand name that didn't have a generic was out. My obgyn went through all the comparable generics with me and we chose Junel. I was on the higher dose for a few months but noticed way more hair growth than I'd like to admit, so my obgyn put me on the lower dose one. It works for me so I stick with it, but I've never had crazy adverse side effects of birth control so Junel may not be for ever PCOS sufferer.
TwoXChromosomes X The cervix protrudes slightly, and the fluids in the vagina are supposed to make the string soft. The doctor usually tries to snip the string to a good length without being too short (because that's when it gets pokey), and then tucks it back in the cervix fold.   Some women may like it, but a lot of women don't want their cervixes tapped by a penis. Even before I got the IUD, it hurt me whenever my husband was overenthusiastic. 
BabyBumps X Belly button pain is pretty normal, I get that. Also, from button level and up I get intense sharp pained tenderness from gas/heartburn. It's horrible, you can't even touch my stomach if it gets bad enough.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using instead softcups for over a year now and here are my protips, because they are MUCH different than pads, tampons, and even silicone cups:  1) this part is very important: they are not as disposable as they claim.  There is absolutely no need to put in a new one every time you empty it.  Personally, I use 1 cup per cycle, rinsing it with water when I empty it, and have no problems and save TONS of money.  2) During your heavy days you will still need to use pantyliners.  While they offer "12 hour protection," the thing is that when you pee it will get tilted out of place slightly and some of it will pour out.  This might sound annoying but I've learned it's actually a GOOD thing, I generally go 10-12 hours even on my heaviest days without taking it out, easily going a full workday without.  When I go to the bathroom I bear down even more when done peeing, and it empties itself, hands-free.  I slap on a pantyliner for the excess and I'm good to go.  HOWEVER, I recommend trying this at home when you aren't out first, confirm with a finger the first few times that it does in fact return to its proper position, it can take some getting used to, but no problems yet.  3) When you do take it out to empty it completely and rinse it it WILL pour out.  If you've used silicone cups and are accustomed to take it out and having it all stay in the cup while you transfer it over to pour out in the sink...that will not happen with these.  Not a chance.  When you pull out it will all fall into the toilet bowl and is likely to get under the toilet seat on your heaviest days, so when you're all done and have your pants back on, lift up the toilet seat to check!  I was horrified when my boyfriend informed me of the mess and now check every time.  When transferring it to the sink be very careful as it is liable to drip.  EXTRA PROTIP: change your cup before you go out drinking so you don't have to until the next morning!!  4) You can TOTALLY HAVE SEX WITH THEM IN!  However the rim is a rigid plastic so you want to make sure you are totally 100% turned on before going at it (so it's really deep inside you) and experiment with various positions as he may feel it (you won't).  Although I'd say with my boyfriend he only feels it about 15% of the time, and we can just go to another position and then it isn't an issue.  This helps with the mess a LOT, but on your heaviest days it won't solve it entirely, but what can you do when you're bleeding like a stuck pig?  EXTRAPROTIP: Change it before having morning sex!  If the thing is completely full from a night without going to the bathroom it is liable to...uh...give you a lot more mess than you were hoping for.  Overall I love my cups.  They are a great balance of affordability and convenience.  I honestly completely gave up silicone cups when I got this because the spontaneity is amazing.
BabyBumps X I have no opinion, just wanted to share a story. A girl I used to work with had her baby boy this past January. He was 11lbs4oz. She was not diagnosed with GD and she was induced at 41 weeks. She delivered him vaginally with no issues and some tearing but no worse than her much smaller daughter. When I met him, my pregnant self's first thought was holy crap!  Look at the size of his head!  But it truly didn't complicate her delivery.  I trust and listen to my doctor, and would probably do as she suggested after she answered my questions for me. What you need to decide is how much you trust him to be right in this.  Good luck!!  Either way, baby soon!!  Yay! 
TwoXChromosomes X [None are 36 months paid]( _leave)...  In Estonia you get 140 days of maternal leave (more if multiple births or complications) + one parent gets 435 days of "parental benefit". If the mother takes both it's 19 months and a little extra. In case of adoption no maternity leave is paid but parental benefit is paid until the child is 18 months old.  It's even higher in Russia, 140 days (more if multiple births or complications) + 18 months of paid maternity leave. Altogether almost 21 months.  The next longest - several other countries have 12 months of paid maternity leave.  EDIT: I should mention both Russian and Estonian governments are actively trying to promote population growth. 
BabyBumps X Personally, I have had a bunch of ultrasounds. For specific reasons though. The first one was at 6 weeks (we thought it was 9 at that point) and they were concerned because they couldn't find what they were supposed to for 9 weeks. They called me in for a follow up because they thought I had a miscarriage, all was fine! Then when I actually started at my midwife's office they ordered one because they couldn't find the heartbeat with the doppler. She wanted to get a more accurate due date and be sure everything was alright. THEN, I had my anatomy scan at 17 weeks where they couldn't see everything they wanted to because it was too early. And finally I had one yesterday at nearly 21 weeks just get pictures of what they couldn't before. I think I have had WAY more than the average woman though.
TwoXChromosomes X You have hypothyroidism also sometimes called Hashimodo (sp?). I have it and went to see an endocrinologist. I have been on synthroid for the past few years and am actually successfully losing weight. Please let me know if you need any help/advice/diet and exercise tips. DM me anytime. And also, please see a doctor. Ignoring your thyroid can lead to heart failure. 
BabyBumps X I'm in the same situation as OP. At 40 weeks 6 days, my Bishop score was... 0. At 41 and 2 days yesterday, still... 0. My induction is scheduled for 42. After 42 you have to come in EVERY DAY to get an NST. I'm starting to feel like since I'm going to have an induction with a 0 Bishop score anyway, why push it?
BabyBumps X My boobs get in the way more-so that my bump atm :P I spill EVERYTHING on my boobs lol. The bump just gets in the way of hugs. I go in for one and I always let out an 'Oofph' as I forget that I now have to turn slightly, or bend over to make sure I'm not pushing my belly into the other person :P I did this to my SO last night and the baby kicked back out of protest :D I swear I have an octopus in there. It never feels like just ONE baby is moving.
BabyBumps X Mine's back. =[ Every morning, I wake up thirsty, hungry and nauseated. It's like I'm incredibly hungover.  I have to wait awhile to eat or I'll throw it up, but not too long that I'm throwing up from not eating. Blech.
TwoXChromosomes X Concerning the yogurt - certain antibiotics aren't supposed to be taken with dairy so make sure you read the pamplet and ask the pharmacist. I just finished a strong round and was advised that dairy should be avoided a certain time before and after taking the medication. 
BabyBumps X I gave birth in a birthing center at my hospital. It was a really enjoyable experience. They even gave my husband and me a steak dinner to celebrate baby being born!
BabyBumps X My hospital birth was *amazing*, I would not trade it for anything!  I have never felt so well cared for, the nurses gave me 100% of their undivided attention (there were at least 3 other ladies in active labor)!  My team of nurses was just phenomenal!  I don't know how I would have done it without them, they were so upbeat and positive!  It must be a difficult job to work with laboring women day-in &amp; day-out ;-)  And the OB who was on call, he was cracking jokes while I pushing out the baby, anything to keep the mood light.  He was wonderful (I think I liked him better than my OB!).  I also had an epidural which seems to have quite the stigma.  I honestly don't feel like I lost any of the experience, I don't feel that I missed out on anything.  My contractions were so painful and my labor progressed so quickly that I am thankful that I had the option for pain management.  I wish all hospitals were as awesome as mine; I never once felt that I'd lost control and the nurses even double-checked that I *really* wanted the epidural, encouraging me to try without (no fucking way!).  I feel quite privileged that I was never pressured in to anything I didn't want.
BabyBumps X I loved my hospital births.  I do not like the hospitals down here and do not trust them after hearing way too many bad things (the worst things I heard about my old hospital was "they won't let me choose to induce if I have no medical reason!" which honestly made me like the hospital more) and that is why I chose a home birth with a midwife... but if I were back home, I'd have no issue doing another hospital birth because I know I wouldn't be pressured to have interventions that are unnecessary.
BabyBumps X It depends on the hospital and the caregiver, the same it would at home or a birth center! My first hospital and labor was not horrible but not great. My second I chose a different practice of midwives and a more natural friendly hospital and it was the best experience!  So great I'm doing it again in 4 months!
TwoXChromosomes X I haven't really had my period in years due to pregnancies and nursing, but I generally prefer pads.  I wear a mixture, though.    The first few times I tried to wear tampons, I was still a virgin, and I was scared to put them in all the way (properly).  I put them halfway in, and, man, did that hurt!  So, if you try it, don't chicken out.  Put it all the way in, or else you'll be uncomfortable.    When I wear tampons, I've found I get a little bit of a mess, so I have to wear a liner anyway.  I'd rather just wear a pad than a tampon plus a liner.  That's just my opinion.    When some women suffer from really long periods, they can chafe from wearing pads.  It's probably a nice break to wear a tampon and not have a pad rubbing.  
BabyBumps X I just had a precipitous VBAC at 40 weeks in the hospital and it was a very healing experience. It could not have possibly gone better. I was terrified going in, especially in a small town. It was such a positive experience that I made it a point to discuss it with the director of the unit when I was discharged. 
BabyBumps X It is not only her baby. The baby has a father, too. And he has a right to have a opinion, too. In my opinion you two have to talk and find a way that BOTH are happy with.  What is that advise?!!!  &gt;everyone else can suck it   You are talking about the father, her husband! They are planning to raise a child - THEIR CHILD - **together**!  
BabyBumps X Birthing centers are a really good alternative to hospitals for a normal pregnancy. Totally go take a tour or both. Watch "the business of being born" and ANY episode of "a baby story". 
BabyBumps X It is horrible. I've have one augmented birth, and one birth without medication. This current baby is going to be born at home, but I understand that's not for everyone.
BabyBumps X In regards to the membrane sweeping...  If your body is about to go into labor on its own, sweeping the membranes (running a couple fingers inside the cervix against the sac to separate the membranes that are there, it also releases some labor hormones and can stretch the cervix a bit) can send you over the edge. However, if you're not about to go into labor, it really doesn't do anything.   With my first I got a membrane sweep at 37w, 38w, and 39w2d and delivered 39w4d. I have no clue if that last sweep did anything. I'll start getting sweeps at 37 weeks since my midwife considers that full term. But, everyone is different. 
TwoXChromosomes X I never said not to talk to your doctor. My problem is that you are providing information that is just plain incorrect.  &gt;had a hard time getting back on what was their normal cycle  *You do not have a normal cycle on combined pills because you are not ovulating.*   &gt;when I first switched to seasonale from a normal monthly pill I spotted for three months straight-- then when I stopped my period all together I spotted and cramped at the three month mark quite badly -- really it was break through period-- and it took about a year for my body to be used to the idea of not getting a period  This is extremely common when trying to take birth control continuously. The information for Seasonale even says that during your first year you should expect the same number of days of bleeding as you would have when not on the pill. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you have a heavy flow, tampons are awesome.  But once I started taking the pill and my flow decreased, I find even the slimmest tampons can be uncomfortable.  Honestly, if you are comfy the way you handle things, no need to switch it up.  If you are curious, though you should try it.  Why not?  The worst that can happen is that you don't like them.  It's not like you would forget about it up there either since you are used to switching out your pads.  Why not prepare yourself for a situation where you'd need one?  
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on your employer.  I had NO paid maternity leave &amp; my company is too small to qualify for FMLA (unpaid leave).    I took 2 weeks vacation (I which I accrued &amp; saved during my pregnancy) &amp; 6 weeks Short Term Disability (1 week unpaid, 5 weeks 60% salary); by overlapping my vacation &amp; STD to avoid unpaid leave, I only had 7 weeks off before I had to return work.  It sucked.
TwoXChromosomes X In my opinion it should be shared between government and the employer. Government should use tax money to pay for maternity leave for up to the first year of a child's life and allow a second year without pay. The parents can decide between them which parent will take the paid leave. The employer, on their part needs to save the job for the person on leave and calculate benefits and bonuses as if the time off on leave was part of the employee's record.  
TwoXChromosomes X Nah, I'm pretty sure it's fine to think seeing someone else's bloody, used panties is gross, regardless of how feminist and empowering it may be. I see enough of that myself, I don't want to see someone else's.
TwoXChromosomes X I would probably have your gyn check it out, could just be a bacterial infection!  I'd avoid any scented soaps, douching, etc. 
TwoXChromosomes X Can your bathroom trash can have a liner? It might help if you use a liner as far as the blood leakage goes. 
TwoXChromosomes X There are a few anti-abortion folks who really think that the goal is to *reduce abortions.* They advocate for birth control access and sex ed, because those are the ONLY things that can really reduce the number of abortions that happen.  The folks screaming outside clinics? They are NOT about reducing abortions; they are about reducing *choices*. The things you talk about increase choices. They're not for that.
TwoXChromosomes X Condoms can really deaden the feeling for a guy and he might feel that maybe you don't trust him to be STD free, but really he needs to get over it. Even if you were taking the birth control 100% amazingly, it's not 100% effective. Honestly, even with a clear STD test in hand, condoms aren't too much to ask when you weigh up the cost of an unplanned pregnancy. 
TwoXChromosomes X But it isn't 100%, even with an IUD my SIL ended up getting pregnant. Also effectiveness is based on how consistently you take the pill and OP says they don't take it correctly.
TwoXChromosomes X They are all natural body functions that shouldn't be shamed, but they are all unsanitary and unpleasant. 
TwoXChromosomes X Hello. Many great advices so far. I assume you are on combined pill (since you are on it for acne and period control) and not progesterone only pill.  Just for some quick info: **if taken correctly** pill provides a better protection (&gt;99%) than condoms (98%) from pregnancy, but obviously it does **not**  provide any protection from STIs. Many people with STIs do not have any symptoms at all, and they might not even know they have it. STIs in women, if left untreated, can lead to infertility. Do not agree to have sex without condom with a new partner unless you both had a test done in a clinic (and didn't have sex with other people since then). I hope I make sense. If you are already taking COC, why not use it for contraception as well? (someone already asked that above) I think it will give you extra protection, while using condoms. And on a side note: you should have your first time with a person, who really cares about you and how you feel. Don't feel pressured into anything, you have every right to ask a man to wear a condom. 
beyondthebump X My daughter did well with the Dr. Brown's glass bottles. They are kind of a pain to wash, but they didn't give her too much excess gas either. Whatever bottle you end up using, always use the slowest flow nipples you can find and never switch as long as she is nursing, even as she gets older.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm the exact opposite! I want my period to go away for a few years! I was on Seasonique for a few years, and just last year went off of it only to get my period every month. It seriously irks me every month, I hate it! I never get a break!
BabyBumps X I miscarried in September, conceived again in  January and now my baby girl is healthy at 21 weeks.  And Renee did help me heal a bit, from my previous miscarriages.  She's my little miracle baby. &amp;lt;3 I'm not going to lie, there was (and still is) a lot of worry for me about miscarrying again.  Hitting 12 weeks helped, and then it helped even more once I started feeling Renee move.  Now I only really get anxiety right before an appointment, even if I felt Renee in the waiting room.  But that is just me being irrational, and worrying right before an appointment is a huge improvement from before. Almost all women go on to have healthy pregnancies after miscarrying.  Just focus on the small milestones.  First hearing heartbeat, first ultrasound, entering second trimester, feeling movements, etc.  Congrats hun!
BabyBumps X I feel you on the tailbone pain! I sit at work all day at my desk and it aches bad....and I'm pretty sure I broke my tailbone sledding a few years back so it generally ached when I sat too long before anyway. Now it's even worse.
beyondthebump X I use the breastflow by first years.  The double nipples are a pain in the butt, however he won't take normal bottles (good for me I guess.)  My son is very picky about bottles and pacifiers and that one worked for us.  :)
BabyBumps X When I am walking or sitting upright, she pummels my bladder and lower abdomen. But if I lay down its my upper right side she moves to. It is starting to make the right side of my belly look a little lopsided. :). I love the middle belly kicks. It seems to make it even cooler if I can see my tummy move instead of just feel it. :). This is the best part of my day. I waste time I should be cleaning, reading, sleeping, just watching to see where/if she'll kick next!  :)
BabyBumps X baby never started biting after they got teeth, they started when they started teething, but there are signs you can look for to prevent it   basically baby stops feeding and lets go of the latch... you pull away before baby can bite, then start feeding again. distraction. 
BabyBumps X The kicks are surreal. They start out feeling like gut rumbles, then it's like there's a fish in your belly, then they graduate to a kinda muscle spasmy twitch feeling and then before you know it there's the awesome thumps. I remember waking up one time to the bed shaking and thought it was an earthquake. Was about to get in the doorway before I realized nothing else was moving but my stomach. 
BabyBumps X I can sympathize there, it's felt pretty surreal to me most of the last eight months too! Even though I've been eat/sleep/breathing pregnancy and baby stuff almost nonstop. You'd think I would have gotten sick of it by now, but nope... :)
AskWomen X I had Implanon! I gained some weight from it, and I now have a lovely little 'stache that I have to remove on a biweekly basis. But on the upside, it completely stopped my period for three years, and I didn't have to worry about taking any pills. It was super, super convenient.  Removal was a bitch and a half. Then I got the Mirena IUD put in the same day. That was not a fun day, let me just say.
TwoXChromosomes X There are gynecologists who have trained to work with women who have been sexually abused, it might help if you found one (maybe a crisis center would be able to give you a referal?). Any good gynecologist will be kind, make you feel comfortable, and explain everything to you though. If I were you I would ask my friends and try to find a doctor with a good reputation.  The exam is really really fast even when the doctor moves slowly and explains everything. You'll be out of there in less than five minutes. Usually a nurse takes you back and gives you a drape, then leaves. You undress from the waist down and cover yourself with the drape. When the doctor comes in you she will introduce herself (make sure to ask for a female doctor if this is important to you) and ask you to lay back and put your feet in the stirrups. She should warn you before touching you (my doctor starts my touching my thigh then moves her hand up, it's less jarring that way) and she will look at your vulva to make sure that everything is normal - mostly she's checking for lesions and warts. There is a bimanual exam where she will quickly out two gloved, lubricated fingers inside of you and press on your stomach with her other hand. This is to check out your internal organs and make sure that everything is in the right place/doesn't feel weird. The last part involves the speculum. It's a plastic or metal spreader that is lubricated, placed inside you, then opened up. It feels a little weird but it shouldn't hurt - I like to take a deep breath at this part. She'll press some swabs against your cervix (this is the pap smear and STD test) and then pull everything out. It takes about 30 seconds.   They might also do a blood draw to look for HIV and syphilis. The internal swab checked for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Most doctors also take a swab for a wet-prep, which means that they look at everything under a microscope. This would show yeast or trich.   Um... I don't have any super funny stories, but I'll try:  I've seen exactly one male gyno, and he was actually a family physician who was doing a rotation in the gynecology department at my school. I was really nervous about having a male doctor but I had a yeast infection and wanted to be seen the same day so I sucked it up and went in... he was actually really cool. He had an industrial and he complimented me on my hood piercing and asked if it currently hurt (he was trying to diagnose the source of my pain so it was a relevant question). I saw a lot of doctors for vulval pain that year and he is the only person who thought to ask about the piercing.  I also went to the county health department for an STD test this year. There was this ridiculous poster over my head that had "101 Reasons To Be Monogamous." It was all things like "always know how to make the coffee" and "your parents will remember your partner's name." When the nurse who was doing my tests came in I told her that I thought the poster was a slut shaming piece of shit... she agreed with me and told me about how she used to be poly. What a cool lady.  
BabyBumps X Sometimes mine felt like a little tap-tap-tap.  I was pretty sure it was munchkin, because it was very isolated and in one spot.  I didn't feel a very clear thunk, without thinking it might be gas, until 17 weeks, though.  Now he's a squirmy wiggler :)
beyondthebump X I tried side nursing one night during that first growth spurt around four weeks and his poor belly hurt all the next day due to gas bubbles. So what do you do when it's time to burp him and you've both fallen asleep?
AskWomen X I was on birth control pills for about 10 years and I switched to Mirena a couple months ago. When it first was put in, I had constant bleeding and severe cramps for about a month and a half. A few weeks after that stopped, I had what I only assumed was my first period on it which was heavy and lasted a full two weeks. Two weeks after that ended, I started bleeding again. I've been bleeding very heavily for a full week now with no end in sight.   My doctor said because I'm thin, Mirena will likely stop my periods completely. Here's hoping that happens sooner than later (or never.)  I paint a bad picture of it, but I don't mind it so much. Better than taking pills every day and more effective. 
TwoXChromosomes X Pro-choice answers:  Yes. When you want to keep the baby.  Very rarely. I don't know anyone who is anti-choice.  No.  Perhaps that making abortion illegal doesn't appear to have any effect on abortion rates but does increase the number of deaths of women. Or perhaps what they think should happen to women who abort if abortion is made illegal.
TwoXChromosomes X Am I the only one who doesn't flush my used, bloody tampon? I just can't handle the idea of blood just lingering in the trash. 
BabyBumps X Same here, haven't told anyone at work yet and the hot/cold thing really sucks. As well as the constant bathroom breaks and chugging water :/   EDIT: Lucky me this morning I get to work and after eating a light breakfast, I get the morning sickness dry heaves :( 
TwoXChromosomes X As a pro-choicer, I'm glad that there aren't more Rick Santorums in the world and all, but I've always been genuinely curious about the pro-life position that makes exceptions for incest and rape. If you truly believe abortion is the same as taking a human life, shouldn't it not matter when rape is involved? I mean, we don't even put the rapist himself to death, so it seems strange to me that so many pro-life people would support putting the fetus to death when they believe the fetus is equivalent to a person.
beyondthebump X depo was great for me, stopped my periods (normal) no negs at all.  implanon i had to get taken out, i got very moody and low. Horrible horrible time. Everyone is differant.  I had a coil fitted last week...still crampy and kinda insta period, butseems ok :)  good luck x
BabyBumps X I had a lot of lower back pain pre-pregnancy, but it seems to be much worse now.  Before, the pain I would experience was only when I'd lay down, but now it seems like if I'm on my feet for too long (like if I'm vacuuming or doing laundry)  it seems unbearable.  Luckily, I was able to stretch it out some, but I'm sure the pain will be back next weekend when it's time to rinse and repeat!
BabyBumps X haha..i wish i knew exactly where mine was positioned. She seems to move around so much, I am never really sure which way she is facing. I don't know if she's kicking down or kicking up or what..I just know she's kicking me!
TwoXChromosomes X I guess... the hanger would be far more likely to just kill the pregnant woman as she accidentally punctures her colon rather than just the baby. The pro-lifers I talked to prior to the war on women said it was a good thing that the women died because they were trying to kill their babies. I don't really think pro-lifers would use this poster just because it doesn't match the mindset. "Never Again" just doesn't have the right ring in my mind...
TwoXChromosomes X This happens to me too ... I use the nuvaring back to back so i don't bleed. I can go three months, and then i start to spot. If you allow yourself to bleed one week then you should be good again for another few months.   I'm not willing to trade my ring in for pills again, so this is a good compromise for me. If you don't want periods AT ALL, you should go see your doctor again ... There might be a better pill for you. 
BabyBumps X At 21 weeks I still haven't had it show up.  We'll see what the next 19-20.something weeks bring.
beyondthebump X I could still kind of feel the sensation. Like a tightening in my uterus. No pain.. but could just tell when I needed to push. Almost instinctively.   Plus, the nurses and what not tell you it is coming and when to push.  As soon as it is taken out things began to go back to normal. And a nurse had me walk to the bathroom. Not sure on time... I was in awe of my baby girl and feeding and taking pictures..   But I will say this... It felt like forever until my bladder control really came back. 
beyondthebump X I had zero urge to push. They just had me push when I felt like I could. I guess that worked fine? I was helped getting up to go into the bathroom within an hour or so it took about that long to wear off.   My epidural was the only way I got through labor. The pain from the contractions before the epi was so bad I almost passed out. In fact I barely remember that part of the labor because my mind blocked it out. After the epidural, labor was easy. When he was coming out, I could feel it, but I had absolutely no pain. None. 
BabyBumps X I just got my negative result back! I'm excited because now I can plan to labor at home regardless of my water breaking. My water was broken before contractions started last time, I can't imagine being in the hospital all day. 
BabyBumps X I kept looking at the image, thinking it was a picture of a little weiner... whoops.    That is indeed a very clear, beautiful *profile* shot... Congrats!!
BabyBumps X I have this too, by the end of everyday I have to lay in Ed with a pillow propping me up. If I bend my knees up it hurts worse, like it's putting too much pressure on my pelvis. By 12pm everyday I start limping and when i go on my walks it gets worse. My dr said its normal and to keep up with the yoga and walking :( 
TwoXChromosomes X It's most likely because you've been skipping your "period" and your body is now ready to shed the uterine lining that's been building up. The best thing to do is to take a 4-day break from your pills and then go back on them. This can help "reset" your body, so to speak, and help the bleeding stop. It's extremely common to have breakthrough bleeding when you skip your placebos.
BabyBumps X And way more fun if you're far enough along. This makes it all more awesome because my baby wouldn't move or kick if he sensed a hand on my tummy trying to feel him. I was about 5 months and Jack-Jack was sleeping all curled up on my side and my baby gave a hearty kick and kicked Jack-Jack right in the butt. Jack-Jack jumped up and stared down at my side, "wtf?!"
AskWomen X Yes. Moon cup. Best thing ever. You become really comfortable with inserting your fingers in your vagina in a nonsexual way after your first cycle. You become a pro a placing the cup inside of you after two cycles. No more nasty bathroom trash cans during that week ever again. I have had mine for a little over a year and can't believe I have gone this far in life without one. I love it and recommend it to anyone who cares. A great way to save money and not have to worry about running out to buy tampons during that time of the month.
AskWomen X I wonder if you didn't have the right type or size for you. I have very heavy flow and the diva cup has literally changed my life. It's so much LESS gross than all of the alternatives....for me, at least. 
AskWomen X Diva cup and before they made those a Keeper (they looked a bit like tiny, handleless toilet plungers to me with their coloring, though).  They're wonderful.  They don't leak as much, are more comfortable (can't feel them or tampons when they're in, but my flow has been heavy enough at points that with the frequency of changes required, even though thoroughly drenched tampons started chafing, which isn't a problem now since the cups can hold more and aren't chafing-y material to start with).  I find they make me feel cleaner and less gross as well. 
TwoXChromosomes X A-fucking-men. I love my Planned Parenthood. My husband and I could probably afford for me to go to a "real gyno" and get my birth control, even without insurance, and I still make the choice to go to PP, just because they are so awesome. I usually try to donate to them too, just because I can afford to, and I want everyone to have access to the same non-judgmental, sex-positive service that I get.  
TwoXChromosomes X It's based on an individual woman's cycle.  There is a great deal of discussion about how a woman with an irregular cycle should conduct herself.  Basically, if it is more or less regular with some variance, she should anticipate the shortest likely time for when it starts.  When it ends she still checks and counts seven clean days normally before going to the mikvah.  If her cycle is radically irregular, it just starts when it starts... I think.  I can check with my wife, as she's way more familiar with the relevant laws than I am (for obvious reasons).
AskWomen X I emptied out my cup every 8-10 hours. I ended up washing it maybe 2-3 times a day. I have a Diva Cup and according to the website, it says it empty it out at least every 12 hours. I've never had to take it out and rinse in it public. Since none of it is outside your body, it doesn't get gross if you have to pee or poop (not like the tampon string). If you must, you can drain it and just wipe the excess blood off with some toilet paper.
BabyBumps X It takes 3-6 months for your baby to regenerate the lost blood. Why not just let them have what is theirs at birth. The benefits are [ instant]( -clamping-delaying-cord-clamping): higher immunity, less jaundice, all of the nourishment you provided for 9 months for them, less instances of cancer, and higher iron The blood is the baby's and giving them the extra benefits is more impotant than banking it. Let it pulsate until it stops, your baby is the reason for the cord in the first place! If you bank the blood and something happens to your child and you NEED the blood, chances are you won't even get your own banked blood. The whole cord blood banking is a SCAM!
BabyBumps X yep :) We banked her cord blood AND did delayed cord clamping. Its possible to have both :)
BabyBumps X I plan on having an all natural birth, as long as there are no complications. I'll be practicing medication and hypnosis during labor and I was thinking of asking my husband to take funny pictures of himself, the animals, or of random things and not let me see them until labor time. That way, when a contraction comes, he can show me funny pictures to take the pain off my mind. Does anyone think that would work?
TwoXChromosomes X i've taken the pill for about 6 years, lots of sex, no condoms, never got pregnant. condoms are a bit unnecessary when you are monogamous.
BabyBumps X Tilted uterus here (I mean really tilted... Even my US tech was kind of amazed at my 10 week ultrasound) and everything is just fine, my baby is active and healthy at 21 weeks. Ultrasound, they may do transvaginal again because the baby is still tiny.  At my 10 week appointment we were able to do an abdominal ultrasound with no issues, the images were very clear. Doppler, it *can* take up to week 16 to hear the heartbeat on a doppler with a tilted uterus.  With me though we were able to find it at 14 weeks, it was faint but we were able to find it. So don't let google freak you out about having a tilted uterus.  It's actually fairly common to have and it doesn't affect much of anything.
TwoXChromosomes X Pulling out by itself is basically just a way to put off pregnancy for a little while. It sorta works, but not enough.  If you're extra paranoid about babies, the pill plus condom means you're covered. But adding withdrawal if you choose to can add an extra (very small) percent effectiveness, because should the condom break or leak you will have fewer sperm inside of you. 
TwoXChromosomes X Either you put it in wrong *or* you have a very unusually-located cervix. If you get the ring around your cervix and up over your pubic bone, it cant get messy unless it's quite full. But I suppose if you have a really low cervix, the angle would be too severe. I have a moderately low cervix and Instead cups slip sometimes but I can usually get them positioned okay. For non-sex-times, though, regular cup styles obviously sit a lot better.
TwoXChromosomes X I bought mine at a Whole Foods, so if you can get to one of those, you might be able to get one!  Softcups are disposable while with the diva cup you buy one and wash and reuse it. It was also $40, not $6. ): Although you might be able to find a coupon.  Also, as purplerainboots said, there is a bit of a learning curve. Honestly, I was at the point where I preferred the cup to tampons within the first day of using it, but that is not everyone's experience. I highly recommend the diva cup to everyone, but for a last minute thing the safer route is probably to just get some "active"/"sport" type of tampon.
BabyBumps X yup...im right at 18 weeks. first time I felt something was at week 16. I feel if you lie quietly sometimes with ur hand on your belly you are more likely to feel it. First time it was more like an exploratory poke. but it was not like anything I felt before so I knew it was the baby. Since then I've mainly been having 'creepy crawly' feelings...like yesterday when I put a heat pack on my back I could feel baby kinda shuffling inside....mostly it's like bubbles pushing against my belly though...very gentle but something is there o_O
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Financially we are completely unprepared to add to our family.  That's the only reason you need, and this is really the best option. You're doing right by your family's well-being, and things will be okay.
BabyBumps X i dont remember my first, second was not til 14 weeks despite trying earlier, third was at 12 weeks, fourth was at 8 weeks but barely (very faint, took me about 5 minutes on my own to find it)
BabyBumps X By transvaginal ultrasound -- I was 6.5 weeks and it was 128bpm. I heard it again at 8.5 weeks and it was 170bpm. :D  I didn't hear it on a doppler til I was about 11 weeks and every appt there after. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yes.  If it goes for more than about 5 days, call your provider - same goes for really heavy bleeding or really big clots.    If it doesn't stop in a day or two, they apply silver to the biopsied area, and that stops the bleeding pretty quickly.  =)  
TwoXChromosomes X Well I for one do not want to see that.  No woman should be socially pressured into accepting an unwanted pregnancy.  Abortion needs to be freed from the images of infanticide and kept open as a valid option for pregnant women, both legally and socially.  I want abortion to decrease only by decreasing unwanted pregnancies.  Abortion is a perfectly legitimate option to end an unwanted pregnancy.
BabyBumps X I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks and 6 days to figure out my due date and measure the baby, and we heard it then!  
BabyBumps X With both my pregnancies at my 8 week appointment I was able to hear the heartbeat :) But that's early and I believe usually it's closer to 10-12 weeks that you can actually hear it with a doppler. 
BabyBumps X My bag has comfy clothes and a couple newborn outfits, plus a new travel kit with a bunch of toiletries. The hospital typically provides a lot of things for you from what I understand 
BabyBumps X Pack two bags - a labor bag and a PP bag. That way you know everything you need for what's going on is in a specific bag. Also less to bring in and have in the hospital at any one time.  What you want to have for labor is up to you, but I found I didn't use most if what I brought because I was so far along when I got there (delivered a little under 4 hours after walking in the door). I had all these great plans and didn't need them, but you just never know! Oh, I will say you will want socks that can be thrown away if they get yucky -hospital floors are dirty! Wear them during labor if you plan on moving around.  As for PP, pack slippers that you would feel ok throwing away (or more socks) in case they get dirty and unwashable. Bring flip flops for the shower. Comfy clothes and a robe. I found that after a day or so my bleeding was under control enough I didn't want to wear hospital garb anymore. Also it just makes you feel better receiving visitors in your own clothes. Do not forget toiletries! Phone chargers, camera chargers, any other chargers you may need. Clothes for baby (at least for going home, but bring a few outfits). Nursing bra or sleep bra if you are BFing. 
BabyBumps X I get this, too. I've always had hip problems, though, so pregnancy just exacerbates them. The worst is when you're sitting and you *think* you're ok and you go to get up and immediately fall back down. That sharp, shooting pain in the hip just takes your breath away.
BabyBumps X Old Navy has been great for me as well; there's not one near me with a good maternity selection so I've ordered everything online. They have sales pretty often and everything I've bought has worked out for me. I especially like the t-shirts, skirts, and gaucho pants. 
BabyBumps X I went for my first appointment at 7 weeks and 5 days. They did a dating ultrasound and we were able to see and hear the baby's heartbeat.
TwoXChromosomes X This seems like common sense - you can easily forget to take a pill, put on a patch, stick a ring in it. An implant is just, well, there. Forgetting about it doesn't affect it. 
BabyBumps X The ultrasounds gave a date that was different from the LMP date.  The doctor decided to go with the LMP date for some reason.
Parenting X I think they're like any organization, some are great some not so. If OP's wife wants to continue breastfeeding they may know why baby isn't satisfied. Such as milk letdown/supply, tongue tie or the like.   I was very successful with my first baby, but my second baby was frustrating to nurse and neither of us enjoyed it. Had he been my first baby I probably wouldn't have continued nursing him and switched to formula. But with some intervention we were successful. It all depends on how committed you are to breastfeeding I suppose, it's not for everyone. 
BabyBumps X Khols has a bunch of winter maternity on clearance sale now including some of the jeans.  I'm in Western NY.
BabyBumps X The only time it is annoying is when there is a foot lodged in the nether-regions. It's like I'm a drum pedal. I can't wait for this kid to stop flipping around and just hang out head-down. Hahahaha. I say this now....
TwoXChromosomes X An IUD has a 0.6% failure rate if used perfectly and a 0.8% failure rate with average use.  BC pills have a 0.3% failure rate if used perfectly and an 8% failure rate with average use.  So you're right, the pill is as good as an IUD or better--if you use it perfectly.
TwoXChromosomes X That's reasonably common.  The shot gives you a huge dose all at once, whereas the pill is a smaller, more regular dose.  The pill made me literally homicidal.  I had to get off it before I hurt someone.  I love my IUD and not being crazy.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't have any experience with the Implanon. But though progestogen only contraceptives are considered 'light' in comparison to the combination pill, many women still experience a range of negative side effects with them. Even though the dose in the Implanon might be lower than in the mini pill, the hormones still enter the blood stream and can so effect the entire body. If the OP wants to go hormone free, I can't imagine the Implanon to be a good option. 
TwoXChromosomes X My mother got pregnant at 46. There was something wrong with the pregnancy, and if she didn't terminate the baby, she would have died.   It's too bad that your decision is so cut and dry that you would chose to die.  I also hope you never get raped.
BabyBumps X Congrats on reaching the second trimester. It seems like the promised land at this point.   We also lost an early pregnancy, 6 weeks, last November. A D&amp;C the day before Thanksgiving. Then we had trouble getting things going again...   We had our first ultrasound today. 6 1/2 weeks and counting. The baby is healthy and has a strong heartbeat. What a blessing! Reaching the second trimester will be a huge relief. Maybe then we can relax a bit too.  Hope everything goes well for you.
TwoXChromosomes X According to [the link you posted]( ?title=Hormonal_Birth_Control#OK.2C_I.27ve_got_some_HBC_now._How_do_I_start_taking_it.3F)  "Some doctors--as well as some websites like Gannett Health Services--recommend using a backup method for the first month of pills in order to keep you protected while you're getting into the habit of taking your pills. While this is excellent advice to maximize pregnancy protection, HBC itself becomes fully effective after 7 days of correct use."  So, where exactly are we disagreeing?? 
BabyBumps X Ah the emotional toll that nearing the end of pregnancy does to us. I'm dealing with (much less) some myself even, already!
BabyBumps X 41 weeks is pretty common.  It's actually ten days after your due date that I hear most obs and midwives will let you go to and then they'll induce.  So that's technically 41 weeks and 3 days.
BabyBumps X HAHA funny how that works I'm hoping this one doesn't go to much faster as I plan to labor at home as long as possible but once my water broke with my first son he was here in like 3ish hours... 
BabyBumps X Your baby has a yolk sac and the end of the first trimester is primarily marked by the full development and accordingly complete reliance on the placenta. So until 12 weeks your baby is only getting part of its nutrition from you.   Prior to about 6 weeks your baby is pretty well surviving solely on the yolk sac and not the placenta.  They body is designed to protect the baby from us until we are aware they are there. 
BabyBumps X I'm sitting in a hospital bed right now being induced. We we're scheduled for a foley catheter induction (crib induction) but by the time we got here I was at 1 1/2 cm so the doc decided to go in manually and make it 3 so I didn't need the catheter. Basically, nothing is definite so even though they may set a plan, it could change. 
BabyBumps X Sometimes, women can get a subchorionic hematoma or hemorrhage that isn't easily spotted on ultrasound, but is still enough to make them bleed. The plus side is if that's what it is and it's so small it wasn't easily spotted, it's not risking your pregnancy at all.  Good luck &lt;3
AskWomen X Do you think it's a good idea for men to ask their partners to sort of "show" them how they orgasm?  My g/f masturbates all the time and supposedly orgasms greatly but with guy she says i'm 1/3 that have ever made her orgasm.  Even then, I rarely do it...she says she's ok with using toys but she puts it all on me, no guidance from her whatsoever.  Should I just outright ask her what do buy, how to do it?  
BabyBumps X NOOOOOOO Don't say that, I turn 28 weeks tomorrow. :( NOOOOOOOOOOO I hated my first trimester because of it - I've LOVED my second trimester. God dam it.  Hope you feel better soon lovely xxx
TwoXChromosomes X I'm a little confused.  Do you usually skip the placebo week and go right to the next pack?  In any case, you are completely protected during the placebo week. Will you have the new pack of birth control within the next 7 days (or however long the placebo period is) ?  After the placebo period, you will need to start taking the new pack or you won't be protected for cases of future sex but assuming you are asking if you are protected during the placebo week, then you are.  If I misunderstood, I apologize. 
TwoXChromosomes X I do skip placebo week occasionally, and in this case I would have because I had sex so close to the end of the regular cycle. I should have a new pack within seven days.
TwoXChromosomes X You're fine.  Don't freak out.  I've had sex during my placebo week (you know those two or three days before your "period" starts?) and never had a problem.  Take a deep breath and chill.
TwoXChromosomes X If you think you can truly be comfortable with your parents raising your child, do it. But you need to think about how you will feel when you are off at school and your parents get to experience the first steps and those things. Will they call your parents mom and dad, or will they know you and your boyfriend as its parents? Also, would you be prepared to handle what happens after college? Will the child stay with your parents, or will you take over raising the child?   The fact your boyfriend is telling you that "you can't go back on what you said" is absurd, but I am hoping (benefit of the doubt here) that he is just scared and doesn't want to have to deal with the responsibility of it. If you have an abortion, your friends and his friends and his family and other people will never have to know unless you tell them. If you have a child, putting it up for adoption or not, people will be there and see you pregnant and maybe he doesn't want to have to deal with it. I think you need to talk to him about why that is the only option he is okay, and let him know very firmly that your mother could not convince you to have it, just like he cannot convince you not to.   The idea of having your family raise the child can be messy, but it can work if that's what you want. You have the ability to put the baby up for adoption as well, which I think can be a less messy option. I think you need to talk to your boyfriend about his thoughts and why he has them, and your thoughts and why you have them. This is not going to be easy, and you are going to need his support, make sure he understands that.   None of us will have the right answer for you, but feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to. 
BabyBumps X In the UK it's mainly bows and butterflies, unless you want to spend a small fortune :( Apart from the jeans and some pants (from Ebay and H&amp;M) I have managed to get away with clothes in bigger sizes. But MATERNITY KNICKERS...mmmmmmm so comfy and big :)
AskWomen X There are a few different types of pain, and regular muscle cramps are not really comparable to menstrual cramps. Since menstrual cramps are a [visceral pain]( _pain), they can cause symptoms such as nausea and vomiting when they are really bad. Regular muscle cramps would be considered somatic pain, so it's a completely different type of feeling.  I have a Paragard IUD, which is known to give really bad cramps, and my worst cramps make the whole area from my belly button to my thighs ache, including some bad lower back pain as well. Sometimes it's a sharp pain that makes me stop whatever I'm doing, sometimes it's more dull and similar to bad gas pains. It really depends.
beyondthebump X I have two friends formula feeding right now.  One has been since baby's birth (there were complications and they had no choice) and the other has been exclusively formula since 4 months.  Both babies are developing perfectly, hitting all their milestones, and you'd never know any difference.    Whether you choose breast milk or formula, nobody should be judging what's in that bottle.  I say props to you for being a great mom who is doing what is best for **your** family!
beyondthebump X i have been feeling that way too.  maybe it's a c-section thing?  i also felt like i didn't get a transition from pregnancy to baby so i am craving being pregnant again.  every time i see a preggo mama i'm like "ohhhhh i miss my bump!!"  i also know i have to wait because i want to do HBAC (vbac but home birth).  i think the fun part would be now i know what to expect and that makes the idea of being pregnant again (also planned which my first wasn't).  but yeah, i want another baby too, lol
BabyBumps X Just go in with an open mind, that really did wonders for my sanity!  I did end up getting an epidural, but I was also induced and those contractions were crazy intense and close together from the very beginning.  The anesthesiologist told me that if it's done correctly, you should still feel contractions and the need to push (which I did), they just shouldn't be painful.  As for how it affected my son, he was perfectly fine, and first latched a few hours after birth.  From my understanding, babies are always sleepy and out of it the first day, and breastfeeding definitely has a learning curve for everybody.  Neither of us had any issues after birth, I was able to get up as soon as I wanted to and he was perfectly healthy.  My only complaint is that I had a numb spot on the bottom of my foot for a few days.  I'm not sure if it was residual from the epidural or if I hit it against something while I was numb though.  Anyways, of course this is all anecdotal, but I just wanted to offer my experience because you should really try not to worry too much about what you end up deciding on.  Again, I found it really useful to inform myself on all options and not make any firm decisions until the time actually came.  Especially since I was induced, any birth plan I might have had would have gone out the window anyways.
TwoXChromosomes X If a miscarriage was forced and deliberate I would call it an abortion. The more avenues a woman has to get a legal abortion, the fewer forced and deliberate miscarriages would exist. **edit**: I am of course not talking about safe and legal clinical abortions here, but self-induced ones.  Of course *some* people do it deliberately, but I am willing to bet that the number is very low and exists because there is no way for the woman to obtain a safe, legal abortion. There is no cause to blame the women who suffer the trauma of an involuntary miscarriage because it's possible to cause yourself to miscarry. It's like blaming someone with cancer because they *could* have gotten it from what they ate, or from not trying hard enough to stay away from secondhand smoke, or using their cellphone all the time-- it *could* be from those things, or it could be a fluke. The human body is a strange thing.
AskWomen X Depending on the day, month, etc. mine can vary. Mostly, though, the best I can describe it is this: Have you ever had a backache that just seemed to hurt from the middle of your back down to the tip of your tailbone? That sort of wide-spreading ache that stems from one area? It's like that, but the pain feels different. It's more insistent by far, like dull knives pressing-- not cutting-- pressing out from the inside, with the occasional stab.  Mine tend to hurt in a very specific pattern on my body. The most sever ache is cradled in my pelvis, then wrapping down the front and inside of my thighs, and sometimes as far up as my lower rib-cage. If they're very bad it can wrap around my lower back. Warmth helps, as does frequent change in position. Pressure on my lower belly is a BIG no, so no tight pants or skirts.
Parenting X Fyi: "paid maternity leave" in Canada means 55% of your average weekly income, to a maximum of $485/week through our employment insurance system. . Some employers offer to top up this amount, but I don't think most do. Maternity leave is 15 weeks (which can start after 25weeks gestation), and the remaining 35 can be split between parents as desired. You also need to work enough to qualify within a certain time period (not too much, 600h, but this could be hard for a part time employee). I believe Quebec is a lot better about this.   Many Americans certainly get the short end of the stick on this one, I admit. However, I don't appreciate how idealised the Canadian system is in this infographic. A place like Sweden has much better maternity leave benefits, afaik.
Parenting X Yes.  ETA: Every company I've worked for has provided paid maternity leave which I do agree with and feel should be offered in a benefit package by companies seeking to attract employees, but I do not think it should ever be a mandated, tax-payer funded entitlement.
AskWomen X It varies from woman to woman. Some get no cramps. Some are like me and get utterly incapacitated from them. For me, It's very different than a muscle cramp. It feels sort of like really really bad gas. You know the type that just sits deep in your intestines and feels like someone is shoving glass into your insides? Yeah. It's like that but worse.  It doesn't feel like spasms either. It just feels like...intense pain.  It's quite hard to explain.
Parenting X We're not talking healthcare, we're talking paid salary while on maternity leave.  Short term disability is usually 60% of your salary
Parenting X Six-week maternity leave is generally not paid.  It's basically a promise that your job will be waiting for you when you return. You can probably opt to get short-term disability insurance with, as you said, pre-planning, as it takes a bit to kick in.  I got it just in case I ever was laid up with another blood clot, and I ended up using it for my maternity leave.  It was not even close to my salary, though, and my sick pay had been mostly used up by doctors' appointments during the pregnancy.  Also, I had to pay extra for my short-term disability.  I was a teacher at a time, and I had pretty good insurance.  But paid maternity?  Nope...you had to save up sick days. 
BabyBumps X Definitely normal not to have many ultrasounds.  I was high risk at first with some bleeding and cramping, so I had 2 ultrasounds at 6 weeks and 10 weeks.  After those both looked perfect, I was no longer considered high risk, so my anatomy scan on the 4th will be my last ultrasound unless something comes up. A lot of people only have the 20 week scan, unless they do a scan at 12 weeks to see if there is any anomalies (I cannot remember the name of the scan... Stupid preggo brain, but it goes along with the optional blood testing and amnio for defects.) or some need a dating scan some point in the first trimester if you have irregular periods. But congrats on mostly being out of the woods!
TwoXChromosomes X Have you spoken with your SO about this?  I'm very pro-choice and wouldn't ever try to talk someone out of an abortion if they were sure they wanted to do it, but you don't sound like you want to do this at all.  If nothing else, maybe give yourself another week or so to think it through?  I'd hate for you to go through with it and end up regretting it.
AskWomen X Either way breastfeeding is VERY important for the health of the baby. Some women who don't like breastfeeding or don't have the time, should invest in a pump to extract and store the breast milk. It somewhat eliminates the weirdness factor you experienced in your dream.
TwoXChromosomes X Less effective than you might think, considering loss of libido is also a HBC side effect for many women. 
BabyBumps X When is your little one due? Tentatively, my due date is January 15, 2013.  This is based on last period.  However, my first ultrasound put at me at three days less pregnant than I thought.  I'm not sure which is correct.  I have a follow up U/S on June 1st.  
TwoXChromosomes X To supply a different experience than the other poster's, I went off my original birth control, onto a new one, and back to the old one, and I had no side effects. The side effects that I'd originally had didn't come back. This might have also been because the side effects for the new pill (before I went back) were so extreme that I had to switch back and maybe I didn't notice any new ones in comparison, but I've had a good experience. No side efffects, didn't gain any weight after restarting, etc. If you're willing to try it and your original side effects weren't all that extreme, I don't think you have too much to worry about.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Why did you make this a meme? Because anything without pictures is TLDR.  &gt; And are you suggesting that pro-choice people are against proper sex education and birth control accessibility? I am suggesting Pro-Life people think Pro-Choice people throw abortion parties for kicks.  Pro-Choice is too synonymous with Pro-Abortion.  &gt; Are you saying we shouldn't teach women how to not get pregnant? Umm, exactly the opposite, we should be teaching them how to avoid pregnancy, not shaking fingers and shaming them.    
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I think the chance of me having a deep depression on them are too high for them to suggest other bc pills? I don't know. Just wondering if anyone out there can offer some experience.  I experienced severe depression and suicidal ideation on the first brand I tried. I was on a lower-dose pill than you were (Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo), yet my doctors have been perfectly okay with me trying out other brands. One bad experience does *not* indicate that all hormonal birth control won't work for you. It does not make sense for your doctors to not want you to try any other hormonal methods. At the very least, they should be willing to try you on a pill with a different form of progestin and perhaps a lower dose of estrogen.
BabyBumps X A doctor will count from the first day of your last period because in most cases the couple does not know when they conceived.  It's their way of being lazy.  If you are going to start counting from your ovulation day, only count 38 weeks.
Parenting X If the federal government in the US paid women for 9 months of "maternity leave" everytime they had a kid, you'd have women getting pregnant the day after they deliver so they'd have another one to pop out once the maternity leave for the first one ended.
AskWomen X I had almost the exact experience with my Paragard. Ultrasound and everything. I've had mine for about 3 years now, and other than bad menstrual cramps I don't really think about it too much. I think it's pretty bitchin'.
BabyBumps X You'll only have to worry about this if you get a urinary tract infection.  And sometimes, not even then.  One of the symptoms of a uti is difficulty urinating, but not all women get that symptom.  I did once.  When I was in 11th grade.  It was AWFUL. 
TwoXChromosomes X What pro-choice means to me is simply ensuring the government has no say in what a woman does or does not do with her body. Regardless of circumstances. Access to information and birth control are important, but I'm putting it out there that I am not in fact against abortion. I don't believe that it's not right, or not ideal, but women should have the choice if they need it. I actually believe that sometimes it's the best choice whether birth control failed or was not used. And I also believe that it doesn't matter whether it's the best or seemingly selfish and needless, the choice still belongs to the woman, throughout her pregnancy and without exception.  Pro-choice to me means that I will fight to make sure the government butts the fuck out of what I and other women decide to do with our bodies. Period.
TwoXChromosomes X For the record you don't need to specifically see a gynecologist to get a pap smear, any doctor can perform an annual exam for you. My doctor isn't labeled as a gynecologist, she's a general practitioner.   Also you're an adult, your doctors office can't disclose the nature of your visit to anyone without your consent and that includes your parents. 
BabyBumps X I'm 26 weeks, and just this past week mine has done this too!  It's so weird!  :). Today for the first time she did what felt like a somersault from one side to the other. It was super cool and also slightly icky for some reason as my tummy stretched from one side to the other. :). 
Parenting X Some of those countries don't offer paternity leave in the slightest. Several of the US states do offer paternity leave. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, it did not sound at all pro-choice.  All but the most radical anti-choicers support abortion to save a woman's life.  
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think the government should be legislating when people can and can't get abortions. While my knee-jerk reaction is essentially the same as your opinion, that by 20 weeks/viability someone should know they're pregnant and should have had plenty of time to make the decision assuming the pregnancy is normal, that's just not always the case. What about someone who finds out after 20 weeks that there is something seriously wrong with the fetus, and that although it may not be life-threatening, the baby will be born with serious problems? I think in that case abortion should be allowed pretty much at any time. Realistically, I doubt there would be many people with normal pregnancies who would try to abort late-term, and there would probably be few doctors willing to do such late-term abortions anyway, so it's not even worth it for the government to legislate on it.
TwoXChromosomes X Something I like to tell pro-lifers: It's not exactly killing the fetus, it's changing it's location. If the only way for me to survive was for me to crawl into your uterus, could you refuse that to me? Of course! Why should I be forced to have a tiny person in my uterus? If I change it's location, will it die? Yes. Is it really killing it? No.
TwoXChromosomes X Is it really the right choice to bring a child into the broken adoption/foster care system we have?  I don't believe it is.  As someone else said, misinformation can keep someone from having earlier access to abortion.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; the fact that it is murder is your opinion.  I never said it was murder in this threat. Murder is a legal definition and since abortion is legal it cannot be murder.  &gt; there is no science to back it up one way or the other  There is no scientific definition of murder.  &gt;a fetus is not a person yet.  There's no scientific definition for a person, either. Also, there's a reason they're called human rights and not person rights.  Tell me, when does a human life become a person? How many cells? How many beats of a heart?  &gt; 75% of fertilized embryos do not turn into a full pregnancy  I'll assume you're right here, and that these are naturally occurring miscarriages. I'm having to assume since you didn't cite a source. Miscarriages are a generally a result of something going wrong with a pregnancy such as a genetic defect or a problem with the mother's reproductive system. This can't be helped.  &gt;Most people don't know that because during the time that the miscarriage occurs, the women often don't realize they are pregnant. There is WAY too much grey area in this situation to call it "murder."  I never called miscarriages, or abortion for that fact, murder in this thread. Miscarriages are more akin to losing a child to cancer rather than a bullet.  &gt; it is not viable outside the womb and thus does not get the same legal protection as one that does  This is a poor argument. There are people on life support in hospitals. Because they are dependent on the hospital for supporting their life, do they no longer have rights?  &gt;There is a point at which the fetus could be viable outside the womb and that is where the law stops abortions in most places.  Not here. There's an abortionist up the road who will perform abortions up to 30 weeks.  &gt;In the eyes of the LAW, until a fetus is viable outside the womb, it is still part of a woman's body and thus her choice to do with what she deems necessary.  No citation. Also, this varies from state to state. Also, I'm not arguing law. I am arguing right and wrong. Something can be legal and be wrong.  &gt;If you feel so strongly that this is murder and everyone should have their own babies, why aren't you adopting to help the problem, rather than adding your own children to the population?  We are adopting.  &gt;Oh, that's right, because it is your CHOICE whether or not to bear children. Just as it is mine.  Yes it is my choice whether or not to have a child. It should not be my choice to stop the process once it has begun.
TwoXChromosomes X After 28 weeks, I think that the issue of abortion needs to be considered differently as the fetus may feel pain. Even if we assume that's the case, I still favor unrestricted access to abortion without the need for consent from anyone aside from the pregnant women herself. I think some abortions may be unethical because of specific circumstances, but I don't support restrictions on the procedure. Something just feels wrong about having that much control over the bodies of other people.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't really have a line. I don't think a woman is ever obligated to serve as a life-support machine for something that hasn't even been born yet. If the fetus isn't viable yet, then whether or not to get an abortion should be 100% her choice. If the baby *is* viable, then she should be allowed to deliver it by whatever means appropriate and go from there.
TwoXChromosomes X all i was saying is her decision should not be based on the fear you are trying to drive into her, she is a big girl and can make her own decision, and does not need negativity, if she does choose to keep the pregnancy, she should not be told to regret doing so, just as if she chooses adoption, or an abortion she should not be pushed into it by anyone, she does have options, not just yours, she is a big girl and can decide for herself if she wants a baby or not. 
TwoXChromosomes X I really respect this. It's not about what we would do personally. It's about having the choice to make the decision for ourselves.   You never know where you will find yourself one day. Judging others does not end abortions. We have to address the root causes. If people had easy, universal access to sex education and birth control, this would go a long way in addressing the problem.  &gt;While I don't generally approve of people who end up having multiple abortions just because they keep getting accidentally pregnant, I'm not going to tell them they can't.  You do realize this is very, very small segment of the population? Furthermore, multiple abortions rates are on the decline. And the best way to prevent this is by providing accessible, affordable birth control to all. 
BabyBumps X Ice pack on the back of your neck and a dark room paired with Tylenol.  I have chronic migraines and had them all through pregnancy and that is the only thing that helped me (that I could take while pregnant).  I hope you feel better soon!!!!!
TwoXChromosomes X Also, you might need to make sure that when you put it in, it has a good seal.  Sometimes when I put mine in, it doesn't unfold all the way or one side wouldn't seal, so then it would leak.  Maybe that's part of the problem as well as length?
BabyBumps X No idea about the hair thing... but a good question for your doc when you see them! When my water broke with my first, I was at the hospital. It was a literal *pop* and gush of fluid.   Weirdest. Feeling. Ever.  Hopefully, you'll start contracting soon and have that baby! Here's to a good delivery! Good luck!
BabyBumps X I'm 38 weeks and have yet to experience any painful kicks.  Mostly uncomfortable kicks--putting too much pressure on pelvis or ribs--but nothing painful.
TwoXChromosomes X Exactly. There are too many exceptions and cases we don't think about that lead to late-term abortions, and I wouldn't want to get rid of any options for women who are put in the position of having to get a late-term abortion.  I know that for me, I might be able to carry a pregnancy okay, but I can't deliver vaginally and a c-section would likely kill me. The thought of not being able to get an abortion after a certain time, especially when some women don't realize they are pregnant for whatever reason, scares me. Late term abortions are a serious ordeal, I doubt many women would abuse their right to one. 
BabyBumps X My water broke in the middle of the night, but it was just an off and on slow trickle.  It felt like when you sneeze and wet your pants a little, only without the sneezing.  I honestly thought I *was* wetting my pants and was ready to chalk it up to yet another indignity of pregnancy.  I finally went to the hospital the following afternoon *just in case* and sure enough, it was amniotic fluid.    I still wasn't in actual labor (I was having contractions, but they were irregular and I couldn't feel them at all), so they sent me home with the instructions to go out to a really nice dinner (because I won't get the chance again for a while, plus once you get admitted they won't let you eat anything), maybe a pedicure, basically have some "me" time.  If I didn't go into labor on my own, I was to come back at 8pm for an induction.  8:00 and still not in labor, so off to the hospital we went.  From the time my water broke until he was born, it took 43 hours, two doses of misoprostol, a metric ton of pitocin, and a vacuum extraction.  The whole thing was like a comedy of errors - everything that could have gone wrong did.  He *really* didn't want to come out!  Best of luck to you!  I'm sure it will go a LOT more smoothly than mine!
TwoXChromosomes X Once a pregnancy reaches a point where the child would survive preterm delivery, I don't think abortion is the answer. If the mother's life is in danger, induce labor. If the quality of life of the child is in question, it's definitely something to be discussed with the doctor and decided on a case by case basis. If its just that the woman has decided she doesn't want a baby, this is a place where I think abortion is misused (once the pregnancy is that far along, I am speaking of). I am very pro-choice, but I think some lines need to be drawn. 
BabyBump X 's my bump. I'm on week 17 + 4 and I'm feeling huge all of a sudden! Your bumps cute :)
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely agree with buying from thrift stores... And then if you eventually go back down in weight, it's not like you invested a ton of money in your wardrobe!  But I agree with Old Navy as well... Awesome clearance racks if you hit them on a sale day! And in our area, plenty of clothes in larger sizes there!
TwoXChromosomes X Also, don't forget that even though it's technically legal in life-threatening cases, there's not legislation around it so it doesn't happen!  Doctors have no idea when an abortion is illegal or not or what counts are significantly life threatening so women with dangerous pregnancies (eg cancer) STILL have to travel to the UK to get abortions!  Completely disgraceful.
BabyBumps X When did you start feeling movement with the anterior placenta?  Was it later than with the posterior ones? Now that I'm 16 weeks I've been trying very hard to see if I can feel movement (lying still with a hand on my belly), but no luck so far. I found out I have an anterior placenta at the last ultrasound, so maybe that has something to do with it.
BabyBumps X We're going to be due date buddies, I'm 12 weeks on wednesday!   Congratulations on surviving the first trimester!
BabyBumps X I felt so scared during my first childbirth that I had to have someone I loved in the room with me.  It couldn't have been any of my family members either.  Not only were they in another state, but they're not the type you'd want in the room while you're giving birth to a child.  I am SO glad my husband was there with me in the room.  He really helped me get through my contractions.  He was mostly quiet too.  He and I are not very talkative people and that was just fine by me.  I loved being able to hold him while I was having contractions.  I felt that gave me strength to get through them.
beyondthebump X it will depend on timing more than anything.  and honestly?  i remember NOTHING from the contraction / labor pain.  i wish my whole situation had gone differently but there are PLENTY of women who have epi's and have a vaginal birth and it goes great.  i think my epi was a prep for the c-section and they weren't really telling me that but just going for it.  because women do not get epi's at 10 cm and pushing unless that's the next thing to happen.
BabyBumps X You should be fine with that amount, syrup or no syrup. If you're worried about weight gain, just cut back in another area (less cheese or smaller portion of something fatty).    I've had Honey Nut Cherrios almost every morning with whole milk since about 6 weeks into this pregnancy, when before I was pregnant I never bought/ate regular cold cereals.  It's just what my body has wanted and I've indulged.  (I have officially gained 21lbs at 34 weeks)
BabyBumps X  Good luck, I've been having stronger contractions today, so hoping they actually progress (instead of continuing the trolling of the last few weeks) and I can join you in a couple hours :) 
BabyBumps X Lol that would make me hurry up too! :P That is exciting! I hope you progress super fast!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Compared to being killed, yes. Discomfort is a good word. It's not like during pregnancy someone picks you apart limb by limb or poisons you to death.  I guess this is another point on which we differ. Your description makes it sound like you consider a fetus at a stage of development where it has no awareness, and its abortion, to be the equivalent of tearing a person limb from limb or poisoning them. I don't see it that way at all, and where a bundle of cells is concerned, even less so.  I absolutely concede that the area gets considerably more grey as the trimesters progress, but that doesn't mean that I don't see black and white at either end of the spectrum... i.e. I by no means consider a single cell of human DNA created by an egg and a sperm to be a 'person', and I absolutely consider a baby about to be born to be one.
TwoXChromosomes X If you want to do it, do it. Just remember to be safe and responsible.  Make sure to use contraception and use it properly and consistently. Pregnancy scares suck ass. Condoms are always good to help prevent the spread of many STDs and also function as contraception.  It may help to read some books like "The Clitoral Truth", "What's up Down There" and for grins maybe include "The Kama Sutra". A little education goes a long way.  Be careful, as being sexually intimate can increase feelings of attachment. Also, make sure you can talk to your partner about sex, if one can discuss it without getting overly awkward or silly it can be a good way to gauge suitability.  Be safe and good luck!
BabyBumps X I felt pregnant straight away. It turns out I found out I was pregnant when I was 2 weeks gone, I had morning sickness straight away :( It always shocks me when you read about these women who just go in to labour and are like "I had NO IDEA I was pregnant" how, how can you possibly not know!?!?
BabyBumps X My wife and I just went through  this as we delivered last week and she had to be given "Mag" to ward off eclampsia as well.  It will probably result in you staying in the hospital an extra day so they can keep you on it and monitor your BP.     You can breast feed without any problems on it, and it shouldn't hurt the baby.  Also, being on the magnesium is much better than having a seizure during labor.  We we were going to deliver in a birth center but the minute the mid wife saw her high blood pressure, we went to the hospital.   It's just not worth the risks.  5% of pregnancies result in preeclampsia and the potential complications from it are scary.  Plans go out the window, but my wife was still able to deliver vaginally, albeit with an epidural to calm her BP with a pitocin and mag drip.  We really didnt want a c-section, but we were prepared to do what it took.  As much as we wanted to go natural, I felt the whole thing was very positive considering the change in plans, as did my wife.  We were just happy we had all these options to keep the baby and her healthy.
BabyBumps X You're welcome.  I hope your cycles regulate soon.  I had an error in my post I didn't realize.  That should have been month, not week.  I actually expected it to take longer, thinking being on the pill for so long would have made me have a harder time.  My cycles were regular before.  Some women use the pill to regulate themselves.  If I had trouble (taking more than a few months) then I was willing to do more of the other methods to track it.  They had a bit of ick factor so I waited :P  Good luck!
BabyBumps X I, too, had a missed miscarriage. I was 11w4d when it happened, there were no babies present, but two small placentas. I got pregnant again a few months later, and here I am now. 1 in 3 pregnancies end in miscarriage, due to a severe chromosomal abnormality, the baby stops developing. It's nature's was of ensuring a healthy baby for you and your family.   The chance of this happening again is slim. I am sure that you'll go on to have a happy, healthy baby this time around. Keep taking your vitamins and folic acid, fish oils a plus. Just keep picturing in your heart and mind a healthy baby growing and developing. I am sending good internet vibes, love, and light for you and your baby (((hugs)))
TwoXChromosomes X I drank it once or twice a day, especially 5 days before my period and 4 cups a day during. It helps with cramps (hydrates the muscles) and makes uterine contractions more efficient and less painful (shortened period, used to be 7 days, then regulated to 4 days). For bloating and intestinal issues, drink about 4 cups during the day. It is by far the best uterine tonic out there, and all natural too!
BabyBumps X Good luck. I had BH that I could actually feel start around 34 weeks, significant around 35, mostly painless but got to be every five-ten minutes. They put me on full bed rest after a check showed they were a little too productive. Hung out there drinking plenty of fluids until 37 weeks. Contractions have been continuing since then, and now my due date is tomorrow and he still hasn't decided to show up. They show up when they want to I suppose...
BabyBumps X If the clots didn't look like your normal clots, then it's very possible it's a miscarriage.  You don't have to, but you can save a few clots and your doctor can test to see if it was a miscarriage (didn't learn that one until after I passed all clots of my last miscarriage.)  However, a doctor is not necessary at this point.  The body is pretty good about passing all tissue on its own, but I'd still check in with your doctor if you're having severe cramping after a week. Don't use any tampons, use pads.  If a heavy overnight pad fills up quickly (you have to change more than once an hour) that may signify hemorrhaging which you'd seek medical attention.  Placing a warmed up beanie or towel on your stomach can help with some of the cramping, try to rest and keep up on your fluids. :( 
TwoXChromosomes X Sorry, I'm a bit confused. Is he still in denial that he has herpes himself? Has he gone to the doctor himself to confirm? Did he state explicitly that he doesn't want to have sex with you because he doesn't want to contract it? Does he not understand the biology of how herpes is spread? Something doesn't add up.  As for the correlation between HSV and HIV: Frankly, I would be surprised if there *weren't* a correlation. They are both sexually transmitted diseases. The same behaviors that increase your risk of contracting HSV also increase your chances of contracting HIV. But I wouldn't worry about this: herpes is far, far, far more common in developed countries than HIV is. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's a bit confusing, but I've found that I have to regularly weigh myself (every week and a half or so--no more than once a week) just to make sure that I'm eating enough. Like you, it also helps me keep eating a normal amount when I feel like I've been eating 'too much' and gaining weight.
beyondthebump X It's ok. A day or two are perfectly reasonable to only be hold by you. My second I had only my family visiting in the hospital and my mom was my birthpartner (it was good for both of us, tough I also missed my husband) and only nurses hold my baby besides me, once released, my husband held him for a day almost constantly and then we were ok with family holding him. Say that breastfeeding is important to you and for it to succeed, you need to perfectly sync with your son, this is only possible if spending 24/7 with him the first week. As soon as you are comfortable, you can give him to someone else for a couple of minutes up to 2-3 hours. Good luck with the rest of pregnancy!
beyondthebump X I felt that way before I had the baby, but then when she was born I was very eager to let other people hold her also. Part of what helped was realizing that they all want to hold her because they love her,and that as mama, you have priority to hold her. No one I have ever met has tried to deny giving my baby back to me when I'm ready. 
BabyBumps X My Goat measured a week ahead in head and femur and TWO WEEKS AHEAD in belly size. I am growing a monster. 
TwoXChromosomes X In my experience, finishing too quickly is not a problem.  Thinking that sex begins and ends with your penis is a problem.  If you don't last long once you're actually having PIV intercourse, then make sure your partner is good and satisfied before you ever put it in.  At that point, who cares how long you last?  You both get at least one orgasm, everybody's happy.
TwoXChromosomes X I would really worry about dropping the diva cup and getting it dirty, and the challenge of keeping it clean enough. I've been trying to use one myself and having problems with leakage, too. I'd hate to have to deal with that while in the back country. The other consideration is that you won't be able to really properly clean your hands out on the trail, at least in a way that I'd feel comfortable having to stick fingers up my hoo-haw.  I would recommend manipulating the birth control if possible to move the date of your period, or going with the 
TwoXChromosomes X I agree with this. I am pro-choice all the way, but from what I read it seems like OP is really already regretting a procedure she hadent even had yet. If you feel like you cannot support or are not ready for a child, but already are regretting an abortion, have you thought about adoption? This could be something you and your boyfriend could think about. 
BabyBumps X During my ultrasounds, the tech has always gone out to show the doctor the screens and measurements, then he would confirm whether I needed to have more done or if I needed to come back for another ultrasound, etc. I never saw the doc and just had to wait around while she spoke to him, then she would come back and confirm with me whether I was ok to leave. I'd say that's all it was, if there was any complications they would have made you stay for more scans or come back again soon. 
BabyBumps X I took the class at my hospital and loved it. I got a book as part of the class and learned a lot of valuable information. It was also good to get a feel for my hospital's attitude toward the birth process. I think it was best for my husband though. It completely changed how he treats me and sympathies with me. He has been amazing and informed since the class. He even has asked to get a doula.  I felt I had done enough research to go without, but he wants a doula to help him be the best birth partner he can be. How sweet is that?  I have also read a couple good books and I am open and direct with my OB.  I also watch birth videos on line. I feel like seeing real births helps me have faith in myself that I can do it. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had nasty cramps for a while now, but I got the Paragard and I love it. I've had it for fifteen months now with no complications. Never been pregnant, and I know some women who haven't been pregnant have issues getting theirs to stick, but mine has been fine. They measure your uterus to make sure you'll be able to accommodate it before you get the thing inserted. Two days out of the month are not good, the cramps are terrible and sometimes they interfere with my willingness to get out and do stuff. I bleed maybe twice as much as I used to. That said, hormone-free peace of mind might be worth it. 
BabyBumps X For whatever it's worth my labour wasn't actually painful. Intense, yes, tiring, yes, uncomfortable, yes, I was out of it, yes, but pain isn't a word I'd use to describe it. Maybe if I'd gotten to the point of crowning (which I hear described as ring of fire) I would have encountered more pain. Didn't end in natural, or vaginal, birth but up until that point it was really quite manageable. 
BabyBumps X You might first try talking with a lactation consultant to see if you can work on your milk supply. In the end the investment in time/little bit of money with them will end up saving you a ton in formula costs, washing bottles, etc -- not to mention the fact that your baby will continue to get all the added benefits breast milk offers.  Look for an IBLC-certified lactation consultant. You could start by googling or checking with the hospital where you delivered (if you delivered at a hospital).  Another option would be to get in touch with your local chapter of La Leche League. They're a breastfeeding support organization. They are very pro-breastfeeding/anti-formula, so they likely won't be able to provide you with advice on transitioning to formula, if that's really what you want to do. But for questions about upping your milk supply and the like, they're a great resource.
BabyBumps X Ok, so I am seeing all the comments about bloating so I randomly picked one to respond to.  I did some more research on baby bloat and it totally makes sense.    What is confusing me however, is that this is what I'm hearing:  'Oh you have a tummy way too early so it's bloat.  Ya, not regular bloat bc it is going to stick around for a while and my tummy centralized so we call it baby bloat.  And ya it has the word baby in it but you can't substitute baby bloat for showing.  So people may even notice or comment on your pregnancy based on the bloat but that is not the same as when you're showing.  And no one is calling you an idiot because we all go through it, but stop considering that you could be showing because well you're not.'   I'm sorry I just find it to be a riot.   Showing, baby bloat, whatever- I need new pants and more creative ways to hide whatever it is at work through July... at which point I'll be around weeks 12-16 and possibly starting to really show LOL    :-) 
BabyBumps X &gt;this is totally going to suck!  Going into it with that mindset will set you up to be begging for pain meds at the first sign of strengthening contractions.  Change your mindset if you really want to do it naturally.   I've had 3 pain-drug free births and two completely natural (first was induced).   Why? Because when my bowels act up, I'm not offered pain meds or an epidural. But it feels the same. Only when I'm done, I'm not holding a new baby, I'm holding a plunger.  Because I don't want the risks having an epidural causes.  Because the thought of an IV scares me after having one burst a vein in my hand.  Because the only thing I want coursing through my body as I hold and bond with my brand new child is the natural hormones that my body makes.  Because despite what some person once posted on a reddit thread, we ARE made to have babies. We just aren't designed to have babies while confined to bed, on our backs, with our legs up in the air.  Thoughts that help me get through:  It will not  last forever. It can not last forever. No woman has ever been in labor forever.  Once baby is out, everything stops. Focus on your goal to get it to end. Look up ways to help progress labor and push more efficiently (like: walking progresses labor, focusing noises you make towards your stomach instead of up/out helps you focus your energy on the right area)  Know that getting pain relief doesn't make you a bad person. Know that not getting pain relief *also* does not make you a bad person, it is a personal choice about you and your body.
BabyBumps X I bled for two weeks during weeks 5-7.  My doctor wasn't concerned and said that 30% of pregnancies bleed in the first trimester.  I was scared and full of anxiety, especially when they called it a "threatened miscarriage".    The bleeding stopped on it's own and my pregnancy is healthy and normal at 31 weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X I'd be surprised if the first thing they checked *wasn't* pregnancy.   Preggers aside, I think everyone has some unsolved medical mystery/unresolved medical issue about them, mostly because it's so hard to see what is a symptom and what is caused by other things. Maybe the tired/dizzy is caused by not getting enough nutrients/calories from vomiting, and maybe the salivating is your body over-prepping for oncoming upchuck, etc. I'm not even close to being a doctor of any variety, I'm just going on guesses from what you said.  Have you been under any new stress lately? Changed your diet? Water supply change? New job/sleep schedule/classes/relationship? There are just sooooooo many things that could cause any medical issue, and it's SO hard to remember all of everything when talking to your doc about what might be wrong. Make sure your doc knows what's up in your life when you try to solve this one, eh? Write things down or text them to as they happen or as you remember!  Goooooooood luck!!
TwoXChromosomes X I went from no HBC to Mirena in November.  I had spotting for two months, with my period being heavier bleeding.  My cycle doesn't seem to have changed.  I think maybe I had some ovulation spotting this cycle, but I'd been having that for a few years.  I'm defining spotting by light pink/tinged discharge that you either want period undies or a liner for, and bleeding as full on saddle-up-with-a-pad/tampon/cup discharge.  I'd read that there's a 6 month adjustment period, and that anything that happens then is "normal" (unless it's distressing/perforation/catastrophic/etc).  Of course, just after six months, I think I'm having a readjustment, because I just broke out everywhere.  Harrumph.
BabyBumps X Although many women have delivered just fine with an epidural and some have even been thankful for it. Just be sure to do what feels right for you and what you think will make you the most comfortable. I've heard that you'll be amazed at what your body can do when you're giving birth. 
BabyBumps X Isn't this type of bleeding usually attributed to the baby burrowing into the uterus?  Btw O.P. I  keep freaking out every time I feel a pain in my uterus and feel 'sweaty'/wet down under.  Scares me into going to check every time:S
BabyBumps X I've had bleeding almost the entirety of my pregnancy, it only just stemmed off about a month ago (thank god, even though I'm 35 weeks as of yesterday).   I went to the ER right after I got my positive test because I began spotting almost immediately after. They did an trans.vag US and things seemed to be progressing though I only measured to be about a month along (I guess I found out asap!).  The doctor said I was probably just experiencing some mild implantation bleeding at the time. It's fairly common. Any later bleeding was usually caused by infections in myself but those were MUCH later and had nothing to do with the beginning bleeding and were something that I personally had to deal with and are not as common place.    If you're that worried about it, I'd say just stay off of your feet if you can, keep hydrated, try to relax and get your mind off of it if you can! Nap. Read a book. Reddit. Try not to worry, it's most likely no big deal, especially if there's not any major bleeding and it's tapering off a bit. I'm sure you'll go in tomorrow and just get a weight lifted from your shoulders! But good luck! Best of news to you. 
BabyBumps X it can be normal to start puking as you near the second trimester. The good news is it is usually gone by 15 weeks, which means only 4 weeks of dealing with it instead of months of dealing with it.
BabyBumps X The cool thing about retaining all of that water is that it comes off quickly after birth.  I am 2 1/2 weeks post-partum and i have already lost 30 of the 45lbs I gained.
BabyBumps X haha, we have the same due date and my birthday is the 13th, and I was a Friday the 13th baby myself! I'd love to have the baby on my birthday, but I'm hoping for any day before July 23rd since I return from mat leave on July 23rd, 2013 and I'd like to be home for his first birthday.
BabyBumps X She also could have just implanted a little late. :)  OP, unfortunately it's impossible to tell anything just by one number, but since you are being tested again your doctor should definitely get a better idea once that result comes back. So far it doesn't sound like anything to worry about :) I believe 30% of pregnancies experience spotting/bleeding in the first trimester so try not to worry (I know, easier said than done!) My first hcg number was only 57. But the repeated tests came back almost trippling every 48 hours and so far everything has been great.   Good luck! :)
TwoXChromosomes X I've yet to find anywhere that makes one.  Misseff has a good idea, but I've found it to be really just uncomfortable and annoying.  Plus, after a couple of hours, the pad thing is either shifted sideways or stuck to your skin, and it can be painful to pull that away from the skin later.    I tend to go with pre-molded cups, since they hide the issue a little bit better.  But still... one side's comfortable, one side's loose.  
Parenting X Yeah, yay for that kid for doing what he likes and all that. Still wanna kick him in the nuts though. Lol
TwoXChromosomes X It took me about a week to figure out how to get it to form a seal. There is a bit of a learning curve.   The bit about turning it a full rotation is a must. It took me a while to figure out how to turn it while it was in or going in ( I personally have to pull it out a bit to turn it) but for me that made all the difference.   I personally found that turning it two full rotations worked for me. 
BabyBumps X You know, Lamaze doesn't actually do the breathing anymore! I was pretty disappointed.   Bradley is husband-coached childbirth- think nutrition, relaxation, exercise, trust in body.  Lamaze teaches how to cope with pain during labor, emphasizes 'focused breathing', movement and massage. Hypno-courses involve self-hypnosis Independent (normally certified by ICEA) draft their own curriculum and may teach components of each course. 
TwoXChromosomes X The only medical benefits of circumcision is in the case of phimosis, and if you don't understand that genital mutilation is a *spectrum* then you yourself haven't done any research.  And yes, women who have had their sons circumcised *did* do that to their babies.
TwoXChromosomes X The only maternity leave you get in the U.S. is Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA leave).  Under FMLA, an adult of either sex can take up to 12 weeks of *unpaid* leave for a variety of purposes, one of which is childbirth, if he or she has worked for an employer for at least twelve months and has worked at least 1250 hours within the last year.  Some companies offer paid maternity leave as a benefit, and some disability insurance policies will pay disability benefits for a limited time after childbirth, even if you aren't necessarily "totally disabled" under the policy's terms.
BabyBumps X Drink lots and lots and lots of water. I get them a lot when not pregnant and diluting your urine will help with the burning and pain. And see your doctor soon.  Also, if the pain becomes unbearable, my doctor has told me I can half fill a bathtub with warm water and pee in it. Kinda gross and I haven't done it but it may bring you some relief!   UTIs suck!
AskWomen X I don't really prepare for them, outside of making sure that I'm fairly "clean and fresh" down there.  But the nurses/doctors are professionals and do this shit all the time. They'll walk you through everything, it's super easy, and really not as bad as whatever you're thinking. I was super nervous before my first one, but it turned out to be perfectly comfortable and fairly humorous.  For me, the "worst" parts are that I get a little ticklish during the breast exam and they use insane amounts of lube for the pap smear (good for comfort, I guess, but requires a lot of clean up).
BabyBumps X I'll be happy to have June babies! My original due date was July 3rd, well with twins that got bumped back to June 19th. At my last appointment I was 80% effeced with no dilation at this point. Hooray for June babies! 
BabyBumps X I'm not scared of the birth itself.  I'm scared of having a newborn and a toddler and a 7 year old and a 9 year old and a husband who could get orders to deploy at any time. It just sounds exhausting to me.  Right now baby is in me and there's very little chance of baby coming out. If I went into labor they would do everything in their power to stop it. So it's not as scary. I know tomorrow, I will wake up still pregnant, and deal with my toddler the way I have all pregnancy, then go shopping with hubby and the kids, come home, and go to bed... still pregnant. In a couple weeks, I have to start worrying about waking up in labor, and going to bed with a newborn in the house!  That's what's scary. Just the change. And having to learn how to deal with it as it happens, you can't really prepare for the unknown, and there's so much unknown.   But on the plus side, it's a good scary. There's a lot of excitement with it.
BabyBumps X I gained about 45lbs throughout my pregnancy.  I'm 2 1/2 weeks postpartum and I've already lost 30 of it.  Most of what you put on in the next 12 weeks will be water weight that will come off pretty quickly.
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, I honestly just went through the same thing. No matter how much I tried to keep it low, it would always go further than my fingers could reach to pull it out. One solution: Wait until the cup fills a bit more. The other better solution: Get used to pushing it out. "Bear down", as people call it. That's pretty much what I have to do. It's sort of like taking a dump, but I'm pushing a silicone cup out of my vagine. How's that for imagery.
BabyBumps X You sit down or lay down on a hospital bed and they hook a monitor up to your belly.  Then they monitor baby's heart rate.  Sometimes they'll have you do kick counts while doing this.  Whenever baby kicks, click a button.  Non-stress tests shows how well baby is.  It measures it's heart beat to see if it's in normal range.  I had to have them because I almost went into labor at 34 weeks.  I was put on bed rest.  That's when their battery of tests began.    He didn't have to go to NICU.  37 weeks is technically full term.  The only thing that happened because he was born early is that he was covered in furry down--a peach fuzz of hair all over his body.  
BabyBumps X I imagine, though I assume it depends on how far along you were, that she would have done a pelvic exam and checked your uterus to make sure you had passed all the tissue and it had gone back to normal. Incomplete miscarriages can lead to serious infections. Hence the concern about a fever. In the absence of a fever, it would still be a good idea to check in with your doctor if the pain hasn't let up in a day or two.
BabyBumps X if it helps any... I found there weren't actually a lot of sleepless nights with baby crying.  But then, I had the baby in my room with me and I breastfed, so it wasn't hard at all to get baby, feed them, change them, and then pass back out. And I was blessed with a baby that never had colic.
TwoXChromosomes X It's not paid maternity leave, it just means you can leave your job for that amount of time and not be fired. You may know that already, just pointing it out.
BabyBumps X If you're worried, talk to your doctor obviously, but as you say you're not really worried...  Baby could be facing backward. This would mean almost all of his kicks would go to your back. So the few that don't go to your back are the few kicks you're feeling.  Or, do you know if you have an anterior placenta that was lowlying before? As it moves up it can muffle the feeling of the movements some until baby is big enough to feel through it.  If you're working a lot, it's possible to be so busy you don't even notice movements (since baby is still so small movements aren't going to be quite what they are in a month or so from where you are.
BabyBumps X I had an ultrasound at 5w2d and they couldn't yet find a heart beat. They also didn't even see a fetal pole, just the yolk sac! It can happen and still be viable. It's odd and scary, but it can be ok. You just have to wait a bit.
BabyBumps X It may have been uterine muscle spasms but I thought I felt her move when I was about 4-6 weeks pregnant. At about 12 weeks along hubby hit the brakes a little hard due to someone stopping in front of us suddenly. She came flying forward and I felt her little bones in my hands. Thankfully I keep my hand between the seat belt and my tummy or that one time opportunity wouldn't have happened. She fluttered away almost immediately.   By 16 wks I could feel her move occasionally but it more felt like gas. 20weeks and I can rub her back and she responds by pushing up towards my hand. I think she likes it. So it was between 16-20 for certain. 
BabyBumps X Started feeling slight flutters at 15 weeks.. I'm 16.5 weeks today and am feeling movement even while I walk and when I lay down, I'm not showing yet, maybe it's the way my uterus is, but this is baby #2, and I'm excited that I'm feeling him or her so soon! :) 
BabyBumps X I felt my lil one right at 16 weeks...but i had to lie really still and quiet and then it was just a little movement - like a light touch...but it felt different from anything else so I knew it had to be the baby. 
BabyBumps X i didn't hit the "pregnant look" until about 6 mths. I still have people argueing if i'm fate or pregnant. and I'm all belly! I get told often I'm too small to be 6 mths, so no one believes me when I tell them my due date. The joys of carrying a baby in your back..
Parenting X Subjecting children to cigarette smoke can cause asthma among other health issues.  Even if you only smoke outside and not directly in his presence the effects will still be felt. It's actually said that the secod hand smoke (on your clothes and breath) is worse for him. I wouldn't call you a piece of shit but I hope you're able to get help and make better decisions for your child and for yourself 
BabyBumps X I had my GD test yesterday as well...  Sounds like fun day for lots of us. I had to stay close to a bathroom for the rest of the day but they didn't give me any Braxton Hicks. I do get them however, and they go away with rest for me. As long as hey are not too frequent, they are nothing to worry about. Just keep an eye out for other signs of preterm labor to indicate you need to see a doctor.  I've been having them for quite some time and they've never caused any problems.  Also, my little monster was the most active she's ever been yesterday so it could be the baby....  Sugar high for her perhaps?  :)
BabyBumps X I tried a bunch on there yesterday. Their selection was pretty picked over. I ended up after 4 different stops, finding one I really liked (even though I know the size won't last me until October, it fit more comfortably now with enough room for the summer) in the Motherhood Maternity section at BRU. And it was the same price as the ones at Target! As a matter of fact, [this]( ?Product_Id=910680082&amp;MasterCategory_Id=MC9) is the one I got! I love the retro look. 
BabyBumps X Eat! When I was around 7 weeks, every time I was nauseous, it was because I'm hungry. I made myself eat and felt better always.
BabyBumps X That is great. I'm excited you could hear the heartbeat. I have my appointment on Wednesday and have my fingers crossed.
BabyBumps X My first prenatal appointment is on June 11.  They wanted to do an ultrasound at 7 weeks to make sure the little one had a heart beat.  Good luck with your appointment Wednesday!! :D
TwoXChromosomes X Pregnancy and birth both cause irreversible and long-term damage to the human body, no matter how well they go. A woman has the right to defend herself from the fetus in order to prevent the harm that it can and will cause, just as she has the right to defend herself against anything else that will do her harm. A fetus is a parasite, and if a woman wants to allow the parasite to feed off of her body and do her harm, that's her decision. If she wants to kill the parasite... that's her decision.
TwoXChromosomes X A vesectomy is the second most effective form of birth control from the stats I've seen- a .15% failure rate per year. The only birth control more effective is the Implanon with a .05% failure rate. And for the record, tubal litigation has a .5% failure rate per year. [source]( _of_birth_control_methods#Comparison_table)
TwoXChromosomes X Here's a smart tip for you:  Don't buy anything from old navy.  That's why you think women's clothes is crap.  Buy it on sale for the same price at a nicer store, or buy 1/4 the amount of clothing that is more expensive.  This is how you avoid shitty clothing. 
TwoXChromosomes X I loved my IUD, but the hormones caused problems. turns out ANY hormones that aren't made by my body fuck with me. I'm going to get the copper one though, probably later this year.  they didn't give me anything to open my cervix but it went flawlessly anyway. :3
TwoXChromosomes X Don't be ashamed at all. You're in a tough spot, and anyone in this position would be confused and unsure, as well. Seeing as you're so young, I must agree with the others suggesting not continuing the pregnancy, however it's *entirely* up to you. This is your entire future that will change if you choose to continue your pregnancy; every aspect of your life will be affected in some way. The first few years will be exhausting, especially if your boyfriend doesn't end up assisting you in raising the child, and even after that point the child will come first for at least the next 18 years. Also to consider: if you wanted to have children in future, you may want to think about how much better prepared you would be to raise them if you had more time to get your financial affairs in order to better support them - raising children is incredibly expensive.   No matter what you decide to do, though, I wish you lots of luck. You'll need support either way you go with this, and keep in mind that counseling might be a good idea if you feel overwhelmed by all this.
TwoXChromosomes X If you can't raise it, and wouldn't be able to give it up, isn't the only reasonable option to terminate? Medical procedures *exist* to better our lives, and an abortion would be to ensure your own well-being.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I guess what I meant was, though it is used as retroactive birth control, it's not like "oh, pregnant again? Guess I'll get an abortion! Less trouble than condoms" cause that just doesn't happen.
TwoXChromosomes X That thing growing inside of you is not a baby, it has the potential to be one if brought to term but when aborted it is not a baby, it is not a child. I love my fiance so much and want to express that love with my body, because I cannot have a child yet I shouldn't be able to express that love? My life shouldn't have to be ruined because of an accident, or you know...rape. No one should have to live with a reminder that they were raped. So  TLDR: It is not a child or a baby, it has the potential but it is not. Sex is not just for a child, it is for pleasure and for emotional closeness with my partner. No one that has been raped and impregnated should have to see that every day of their life. 
TwoXChromosomes X it depends on the size and what type of cyst, if its a small fluid filled one , it will burst on its own, i suggest going to the er when that happens, if ou start bleeding.fyi it will hurt, alot...but you will be fine.  if its a large cyst, then the docs will op for surgery.
TwoXChromosomes X Furthermore, abortions still happen regardless of whether or not they are legal. Many, many women have died because of back-alley abortions. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;An embryo is a potential human. That is all. Why should the life and bodily autonomy of a person be taken away for a potential human?  This. A tadpole is not a frog. A seed is not a tree. An egg is not a chicken. So why is an embryo a person?
TwoXChromosomes X Cranberry pills work wonders!  Also, if you can buy that OTC Azo Standard (that stuff that makes your pee bright orange and relieves the pain) just in case something happened.  That way you wouldn't be in that much pain
TwoXChromosomes X No human embryo has ever developed alone. Every single one of them used an already functional human _person_ as walking life support. And no one has a right to use a person's body against their will.
TwoXChromosomes X As well as what others have said, I find that you can break the seal by squeezing the base just above the stem, and then pulling from there, edging one side out at a time. 
TwoXChromosomes X 1. I fold mine up in quarters, spit on it for some lube and slide it in. Then when it's in I swipe my finger around the edge to get it to pop open. Not until I feel it open up do I consider it to be *in*.  2. I don't know, it never hurts me to take mine out. I'm not sure if you're just extra sensitive or if you're doing something wrong. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yet the pro-life group at my uni made flyers advertising how dangerous legal abortion is and how there was a death in Australia, and how it wasn't long before one happened in New Zealand. I was like, are you for cereal? Pregnancy is much, much more dangerous than a legal abortion. If you ban abortion then it gets dangerous because women will seek out dodgy ones. There's always going to be complications but making abortion look like a death procedure and pregnancy look like the easiest thing ever is ridiculous.
BabyBumps X I can't tell you if you are pregnant or not but I can give you my experience. I pretty much knew right away. I just felt different and every day a new symptom popped up. The only way to tell though is wait and see if you are late then take a test if so.
TwoXChromosomes X You should be less worried about the taste and more about how unhealthy it is to to ingest medicinal cream.   I would avoid sexual activity until your yeast infection is gone, as to give your vagina time to balance its pH level out. This is what the cream is for. If you have sex without a condom you will only give your partner the infection. He probably won't develop symptoms, so he won't know he has it and will only pass it on back to you the next time. If you do use a condom the lube of it might throw off your pH level, so again you should just avoid sex. The less you mess with your vagina right now the earlier your infection will go away. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have heard that if you make the holes bigger, it will help with the seal. I did that during my last period, but haven't noticed any improvements (though the holes were not significantly bigger than original). On my heavy days, I need to empty it around once every 2 - 3 hours, which is a little less than double the time it takes for a "super" sized tampax to get full.  On a side note, does anyone have any recommendations on how to empty the Diva cup and re-insert in a public bathroom? I need to pull my pants way down and spread my legs super wide to get it in there; not the ideal position to be in in a public bathroom.
TwoXChromosomes X I did clinicals at the local hospital's OB ward, and I don't think any of the mothers had a childbirth without induction.  Well, that day -- I'm sure some days they have mothers come in fully dilated and effaced who deliver as soon as they get them to the ward.  When my classmates and I asked about the number of C-sections we saw, our instructor told us that the physicians preferred if mothers could have vaginal birth, but would not risk some cases.  For example, no twins were born vaginally at this hospital because none of the attending physicians were willing to risk the complications (e.g. placental abruption prior to the second child's delivery).
AskWomen X I also have the Mirena IUD and haven't had a child. I've had it for 6 months, no pain past through day of insertion, and very light periods. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.
BabyBumps X Heartburn is so evil :( Every single day, no matter what I eat. It's one of those evil things about pregnancy that no one really tells you about beforehand I think. I have always heard people complain about morning sickness, breast sensitivity, mood swings, swollen feet, etc. but no one ever mentioned constant heartburn! 
BabyBumps X I get to take Unisom on Friday nights and sleep in on Saturdays but that's pretty much it. I should mention that I started labor with my first baby at 100% effaced and 4cm and it still took 17 hours, lol. And my midwife said that I could be walking around at 4cm for weeks with a second baby. Ugh. So ready to be not pregnant...
Parenting X New Dad of a 3 week old here  As I said in another comment, avoid What to Expect like the plague! It's condescending to dads, and full of fear mongering about pregnancy.  Books that I loved:  Be Prepared  Pacify Me: Handbook for the freaked out new dad  The Birth Partner  Also check out www.babycenter.com  Good luck and welcome to the club!
Parenting X If she's going to breastfeed then educate yourself thoroughly so if the hospital screws up and doesn't properly support or educate her about nursing you'll be able to summon the right resources (lactation consultant, La Leche League, etc.). Many doctors and nurses give lip service to breastfeeding but aren't actually properly trained and they make mistakes that can cause a mother to give up on it, so it's the family's responsibility to educate themselves.
BabyBumps X Here in Switzerland, the stay is 5 days for vaginal delivery and 6 for c-section.  The hospital I was at was like staying in a hotel, with 3 course meals and all under a little metal dome.  They really pamper you and try to make your recovery as easy as possible.  If it is your second child, and you have a vaginal delivery, I think they let you leave earlier as long as you and the baby are medically cleared.  They also send a midwife (or nurse or lactation consultant, depending what you need) to your home for visits up to 10 days PP, and longer if medically prescribed.  This really made all the difference for me!  In Canada though, you have the best maternity leave!!
BabyBumps X Still pretty much non-existent unless I eat and bloat. For the first time in my life I'm cursing my strong abs. Let this baby bump pop out!! (And I'm lame and still haven't taken any bump pics at 20 weeks!)
BabyBumps X Actually, if using the blue dye tests, they are notorious for false positives. a pink dye test like that one should be pretty accurate.  The parents of the child(ren) she is carrying may have requested privacy.
BabyBumps X I think I was about 20 weeks when I took my first bump pic, I was just starting to show but if I wasn't wearing maternity clothes I looked more fat then anything.  At 23 weeks its changing quiet a bit and looks more round then fat!  I am still under my pre pregnancy weight from being sick in the first trimester so I'm happy about where I am!  I am also very short (just under 5ft) so I don't hid the bump so well HAHA
BabyBumps X I was super nervous and excited about this scan. We couldn't wait to find out the sex, but we had a horribly mean technician who didn't want to be there, so now our baby's sex will be a surprise at birth :(
Parenting X Hey - similar experience here! I pumped for three months (his mouth was too small for my nipple, so no good latch) and supplemented with formula, but kept trying about once a week or so until 12 weeks - voila! Latching!. But we continued to supplement/pump when it was necessary or just easier. It's nice to see someone else talking about the middle path.
BabyBumps X [34 1/2 weeks, yesterday]( )  Nifty bit of info, went to the midwife today. Everything's great. I've gained 1 pound over my past three appointments. This is a good sign to me that my thyroid has evened out!
BabyBumps X My first was super active. He's six and is still constantly going.   This time around shes pretty chill in there. So I hope it's the same out of the womb lol. 
TwoXChromosomes X Keep going to the doctor. I had back pain, pain in my legs, cramps when I had my period but even on normal days I could have pains that were so bad I ended up lying on the floor crying. Doctor told me it was ibs which sounded off but I tried the whole regime. Long story short I had to go back 4 times and had to self diagnose before he referred me for an ultrasound. I had a cyst that was strangling my ovary when thepain was bad. Lot of doctors don't think about women problems 
BabyBumps X Congrats... though it doesn't surprise me that she was stubborn to show stuff, both of my girls were the same!  Low end of normal is still normal. Don't worry about that.  And they couldn't get a good view of my first daughters kidneys, thought they looked like they had fluid in them (which could be a bad thing) so they scheduled a second ultrasound. Thankfully, because she also didn't let them see between her legs at the first one! Second ultrasound came around, found out she was a girl and everything was fine!  Some babies are just so stubborn.  On that scale? Be zen. Sounds like everything is great/normal.
BabyBumps X I thought the same thing, of all the things, toilet water? My husband thought I was making it up, until I started running outside to vomit because I literally could not be at a toilet without vomiting some more because the smell is just so bad to me. With my last kiddo, it was anything with bleach, that was it. But this pregnancy has been much harder and harsher on me for some reason. I feel like I can smell everything. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have an IUD - the first two months were hell on wheels, but after that, things normalized except for acne. 18 months and I have only recently gotten it under control. Now, I never have periods at all, just a little breakthrough spotting now and then.   But I have to tell you this: if you have not given birth before, they hurt like a MOTHERFUCKER to get implanted. 
BabyBumps X I'm already feeling this way at 27 weeks, and my tummy is huge....  So hoping I have a normal sized baby in there!  :/. That said, I kinda like the rolling and stretching. It feels weird but it's neat to feel her parts. Even though I really can't tell them apart.  If I place my right hand on the right side of my tummy, where she likes to hang out, she will sometimes push out and curl up against it. It's really cool....  Almost like cuddling.  I think it's completely normal for movement to change and as long as it doesn't stop, we are fine!  :). 
BabyBumps X These jeans are awesome, and I found them on sale for about $25. Old Navy has sales pretty often, so you can look out for that. ?pid=895870&amp;locale=en_US&amp;kwid=1&amp;sem=false&amp;sdReferer= -jeans.jsp  I've had great luck shopping at Clothes Mentor. If you have one near you, check it out. Secondhand maternity clothes are awesome because women only wear maternity clothes for 5-6 months a few times, so everything is usually in pretty good shape. If you're very patient, you can dig through Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I found a couple of pairs of Motherhood Maternity slacks at Goodwill for $3 each. 
BabyBumps X You sound like a very intelligent, mature young woman. It is super smart to see a councillor. They can help you put it into perspective. It is such a personal decision. I have no experience to share but remember that it is your body, your choice. Make the decision that you can live with.  The decision that is right for you, not your SO, not your Mom, not your friends, just you. Neither are easy but with the help of a good councillor, I honestly think the right decision will work out in the long run.  Hugs and best wishes. 
TwoXChromosomes X My period was always the same consistent flow throughout my cycle, one month it just up and changed. I would bleed light, almost spot for a day, then nothing for 24 hrs., then normal. When I went to my OBGYN she said, that's just your cycle for now, until it isn't. If you are concerned about it, I'd make an appointment with your OBGYN. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is false. The [new recommendation]( -cervical-cancer-screenings/index.html), as of March 2012, is to have Pap smears every 3 years as long as you are getting normal results, and to not start having them until you're 21.
TwoXChromosomes X I always had one as part of my annual check-up. My doctor didn't just do a pap for HPV or cancer screening, but also STD's and general well-being.  Once I had three normal screenings, I still got my hood popped for annual check-up and STD screening. Seems like an yearly check up should be standard in women's health. But like I said in a previous comment, I am Canadian and we obviously have different recommendations here. 
Parenting X My goal was six months. We had latch problems but I did pump exclusively for those six months. Now at seven and a half months, we've still got lots of frozen milk. We were lucky!
BabyBumps X I know you'll figure it out.  You have a few weeks to research, discuss, meet with a counselor, and reach the best decision you can at this time in your life.  If you choose not to continue this pregnancy, there is nothing wrong with you or this decision.    It could be too that in 5 or 6 years, you and your boyfriend have figured things out, gotten married, then decide you're ready for kids, who knows! I got pregnant at 22 just a few months into dating a new boyfriend and knew we weren't ready (financially, mentally, etc).  I terminated that pregnancy, with no regrets.   We just passed our 10 year's together, 5 married anniversary and are now expecting our first planned child together.  It worked out for us, and looking back, it only reinforced our decision.  Anyway, good luck, and feel free to post in this community if you need support. A lot of us have been through similar situations!
TwoXChromosomes X Hmmm...one thing to note (which you may already know) is that there are two types of IUD.  There is a copper one, lasting 10 years, where one of the side effects may be your periods getting heavier, and more painful...and there's a hormonal one that lasts for only five years, and may make your periods go away all together.  And from any of the literature I've read about both of the IUDs is that they are 99.9% effective (maybe I'm misinformed?)  As for the pricing of it, I got my hormonal IUD last month through a local women's clinic, and it only cost $244.  So, even though that's a bit of a bill, it's still waaay more affordable then what you may think.  Hope any of this helps.  Good luck.
BabyBumps X My doctor told me when the babes are that little its hard to get super accurate measurements unless the UT is like a Champion. My doctor stuck with the period estaminet and I've had two more untasounds since and my baby was right in track with that. So it seemed the measurements were off in the first one. 
Parenting X I didn't have that fall-in-love feeling either, but I also enjoyed taking care of her at least on a practical level. I did not have PPD or baby blues; it just took a long time to bond.  Hope things improve for you soon! :)
BabyBumps X Yay, October babies!  October 1st here, though I'll probably be overdue and give birth closer to your due date haha.
BabyBumps X Depending on how big you are to start with, you might be able to do what I've done which is find extra-long stretchy shirts and then maternity pants/skirts.  You want the shirts to come down to about midthigh if you stretch them out so they'll fit you later on.  I did most of my pants shopping at Burlington Coat factory (they have a maternity section), my shirts came from H&amp;M (regular store), Kohls (their super clearance section), and some nice finds at Goodwill/Salvation army.    I also modified some of my pre-pregnancy jeans (the ones I'd only spent $10 on) and they only recently stopped fitting in the thighs (34weeks). This [tutorial]( -skirts/diy-maternity-pants-2/) is awesome for that if you can sew at all.  If you do this, use a soft elastic and a super stretchy jersey.
TwoXChromosomes X I had a very traumatic experience with an OB/GYN after I received an abnormal pap smear. I haven't been back to 2 years. Stupid and dangerous, I know.   But now I have an appointment tomorrow at 800 with a new doctor. I'm absolutely terrified, but I know it's something I have to do.
Parenting X I don't forget, trust me. It seemed crazy to me that I had to all the sudden give up all my free time and be healing from labor at the same time. I wish someone would take your baby for you every day for the first 3 months. I wonder if PPD would still occur.
Parenting X My little peanut had a really hard time learning how to latch on too. What worked for me was using a nipple shield to give him a more bottle-like point to latch onto. Then times when he was exhausted and hungry I'd try to feed him without it and he eventually gave in and brestfeeds really well. 
BabyBumps X We had our family and friends wait in the waiting room as well. I allowed them back to see me until it was time to push (or when I had to be checked, but even then I let my closet friends and mom stay). Then, after baby was here we allowed them back a few at a time...starting with who we wanted back there first, not who ever ran the fastest. But during the actually delivering part the plan is just for husband and I. 
Parenting X My daughter didn't latch on at first, either. I ended up using a nipple shield, (edit: Medela sells them for about $8 at Target or Babies R Us) and she took to it wonderfully. After about 6 weeks, I just tried feeding her without it, and she ate normally. If you are having issues with breastfeeding, I would see if you can see a lactation consultant.  From your other answers, I would agree that you should see if you do have PPD. I also wasn't thrilled about every moment of every day in the beginning, but there are nice times with the baby as well. Don't feel guilty for "recruiting" family to help - I left my daughter with my MIL for a few hours at least once a week, and it was great to get some errands done, go shopping by myself, or even take a nap. Good luck.
BabyBumps X Your JCP has maternity clothes? Jealous. I'm limited to ON, Target, and Motherhood around here. The consignment stores' maternity sections are kinda bare. 
AskWomen X Have you ever been tested for PCOS?  Hair loss is a symptom of that as well.  If you are already hypothyroid...  Definitely see an endo.  They will check you for everything.
beyondthebump X Pumping can be a little difficult to get the hang of the first few times, but it should not hurt unless you are sore anyways or have a plugged duct or mastitis (which I am not saying you have). If it hurts, then your flanges are either the wrong size or you have the pump on too high of a setting. It should essentially feel painless like a nursing session.  Every woman responds differently to the pump and a pump is never ever as efficient as a nursing baby. It is not an indication of your supply levels nor is it an indication of how much your baby is getting per feeding. The only way to know that for sure is to use a special scale (which most LC's have).  The average woman pumps 0.5oz to 2oz total per 20-30 minute session. So it sounds like you are pretty average. It sounds like you are not getting a letdown during your pumping session, in which case, yeah, you won't get much and will have to work really hard for what you do get.  You could try a few things to get a let down. First, there should be a button you can press on your pump to continue the "letdown" compressions (which are short and fast) as opposed to the slower and longer "getting the milk out" compressions. Your pump's letdown period may not be long enough for you. Also, I find it very difficult to pump when my baby is in the same room as me. When I pump at home, I always make sure I'm in a different room and can't see or hear my baby. Once you have that, then having pictures or video of your baby to look at when you are trying to letdown really helps. Don't ask me why, I don't really know, but I think something about having your baby physically there causes you stress whereas photos and videos help you relax and think about your baby. Another reason letdown could be difficult for you is simply putting too much pressure on yourself and therefore stressing yourself out. It's very important to be relaxed, though I know it can be easier said than done, especially if you're new to this.  As for your LO's poops, yes it sounds like too much foremilk. What I always do is feed one side until it's empty, then if baby is still hungry then switch. Then on the next feeding, start with the second side, feed until empty, then switch, etc. If they don't finish a side, start with that side on the next feeding. If you make sure that they are emptying at least one side per feeding, it should get the baby the right mix of milk and help keep plugged ducts and mastitis away.  Here is a great link that explains what you should expect during pumping (in terms of amounts) from kellymom.com (a GREAT BF resource!): _decrease/
TwoXChromosomes X I have one too! I had the Mirena for four years (plus: no periods, minuses: weight gain &amp; severe acne) and now I've had the Paraguard for 4 months now (plus: no hormones, appetite &amp; skin returned to normal, minuses: heavier bleeding/cramping). So far I'm glad I switched to the Paraguard. There's something comforting (for me) in having my normal cycle back &amp; not wondering all the time whether I'm pregnant! :D
TwoXChromosomes X I am in love with my ParaGuard! Would recommend!   The first three days after the insertion I could not get out of bed - pain. The period for the first six months was very painful. Overall my periods got a little longer. PM me if you have more questions, I am happy to share.
TwoXChromosomes X From a public health perspective, you likely already encountered HPV, so the vaccine wouldn't be effective.  Even the cancer-causing strains only cause cancer as a rare outcome.  
BabyBumps X It's called a transvaginal ultrasound. It gives them a better picture early on. I'm not sure at which point they typically switch to external, and I assume some sonographers just use the external abdominal u/s.   I had the t/v one done at my 8 week appointment and my next scan wasn't until 16, and by that point it was external.   You might want to call and ask which one they'd be using if you're worried about feeling uncomfortable with certain people being in the room with you. 
TwoXChromosomes X I was on progestin only birth control after a hellish 2 weeks of estrogen induced migraines.  I started with the Depo Provera shot, and then tried daily pills.  Dep stopped my period completely (which totally freaked me out), and my period was really irregular with the pills.  I gained a bunch of weight with the shot, but lost it again with the pills.  Migraines were gone with both.    What really made me nervous was the fact that progesterone only pills are even more particular about the 'same time every day' rule (and I was never exactly perfect with that part).  Progesterone does nothing to alter ovulation, only creates a physical barrier between sperm and egg.  If you don't take it at the same time, exactly, you are weakening your physical barrier and increasing your risk of getting pregnant.  My suggestion is to use a barrier method in addition to your progesterone pills, or at least be absolutely sure to take the pills as your doctor recommends.  If you are anything like me (read - paranoid about getting pregnant), I would also buy a set of pregnancy tests to ease your mind if your period gets irregular.    
TwoXChromosomes X She's incredibly naive.   Here's another gem:  &gt;Q: So in the case of the life of the mother, you are for the death of the mother instead of the abortion? I know that is the official policy of many Catholics, who think having both die is the best option.  &gt;A:I have addressed this issue before, and I am not Catholic. If the woman is 100% certainly going to die, it is better to have only one death instead of two, and abortion is the right choice. But if her death is not certain, it is better to wait in case her condition improves, so that the baby is not killed for no reason. If it ever becomes 100% certain that she will die, then she should have an abortion immediately.  Telling someone to wait out a dangerous, life-threatening condition is **horrible** advice. And since when is anything ever 100% certain medicine?  
BabyBumps X I've packed a couple onesies, socks, mittens, kimonos and hats, as well as a couple receiving blankets. Typically the hospital will provide you with blankets, onesies and hats for while the baby is in hospital, as well as diapers, wipes and even mesh undies and pads for mom (although I'm bringing my own cotton ones and choice of comfier pads). But I believe it is standard practice to bring the baby's going-home outfit.
BabyBumps X I wouldn't worry, but I do agree with Mae, I would call.  I am a bleeder, and frequently spot for several days after any kind of internal exam.  I'm sorry the doctor was so rough with you. :( That sucks.
BabyBumps X Lol wait til they get bigger and stick feet/hands in your ribs or Kick your bladder. Especially when you lay down ;) lol
beyondthebump X Holy snot!  I was actually really skeptical about scrubbing my belly button because I thought it was due to the linea, but nope!  It came off in the shower this morning once I did what you said.  I can't wait to show my husband; he's been a bit weirded out by my belly button, but now it looks normal again!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Is there any way to know how hormonal BCs might effect you before you take them?  No. Hormonal birth control is really hit-or-miss because it is highly dependent on your individual body chemistry. There is absolutely no way to know how a specific brand will affect you without trying it. And there is no point in asking people to recommend specific brands, because their experience is no indication of what your experience will be like. The brand that made me suicidal and depressed works perfectly for other people; the brands that have worked fine for me have caused negative side effects for others. And so on. 
BabyBumps X Oooh that's adorable! I saw mine at 8 weeks, when it was still a blob, to 12 weeks, when it's actually a little baby! I would have loved to see it at 10 weeks!
TwoXChromosomes X This is often up to the doctor's discretion; it's based off the outdated idea that women can't decide for themselves whether not they want children. I had my Paragard installed at 22 years old and I've never had a kid. 
TwoXChromosomes X Honestly? I was having really bad periods and just needed something to make it stop. I wasn't having sex at the time and I didn't do a lot of research. My doctor just suggested a brand of birth control that she thought would best work for what I needed and gave me a couple trial packs. There's no way you can tell how something will affect you without trying it first. If you have a bad experience on one pill, you can try another brand. There's plenty out there in a whole slew of combinations and doses. And if pills in general don't work for you, there's options will less hormones, hormones distributed differently, or just no hormones at all. 
BabyBumps X I hit 39 weeks this Friday and I can't wait to have my baby girl here with me. I feel like everyone I know is pregnant and expecting around the same time.
BabyBumps X yaay....a fellow dallas bumper!  I'm from Dallas too :) And I've just finished researching all the hospitals here.   1) First what kind of birth are you looking for? If you are looking for a hospital with more flexibility in terms of labor support, having a birthing tub, not having to be on your back during labor etc (basically they let you do almost anything) then Baylor Dallas is one of your top options. Allen Presby is known to be natural-friendly as well.  Medical City (Forest Lane) is the opposite of that (rather strict rules). Currently I am with Richardson Methodist. They are not bad and my OB is ok (Dr. Khan). However I will be switching to a midwife based practise soon (WHA).   I have also heard good things about Baylor Grapevine (but I think this might be too far for you).  2) Are you looking for midwife based care or OB based? I think this is usually the primary deciding factor. First I picked my OB and then toured both hospitals she works in. Usually doctors will have only 1-2 hospitals (and one preferred one). Since the majority of your visit will be at the doctor's office I considered the OB more important that the hospital.  Ofcourse all that has changed now since I've decided I no longer want to go with an OB...but just letting you know my thought process.   I would highly recommend going through posts on DFW Area Moms.   I didn't want to add more details here but PM me if you have questions and we can chat.   So excited to see another Dallas member!   
BabyBumps X Since I had IVF, I got a very early ultrasound and the heartbeat was slow.  The doctor explained to me (as others have said) that when the heart first starts, it's slow.  
Parenting X My two kids, born 7 years apart, both had the due date of 27 August.  One was born early and the second was born late.    Now, 10 years later, my sister is pregnant and her due date is 27 August.  AND my mom, sister, two of sister's kids (3 counting the unborn one, if all goes well) myself, and my kids all have birthdays in late August/early Sep.    Apparently December is a fertile month in my family...
BabyBumps X I take an insane amount of iron too (although I should be starting iron infusions soon).  My midwife said that if it became a problem to use colace.  
TwoXChromosomes X I am 22 and I've only used tampons twice in my life and both of those times I have been older then 18 years old. I still use pads, mostly because my periods have settled since I came out of my teens and aren't super heavy any more. The worst day is always the second day and even then it's really not as much as I know it could be. My friends think it's weird I don't regularly use tampons, I really couldn't care less! Each to their own :)
TwoXChromosomes X You could just get a dildo. I'm not an expert, but I'd venture to guess first-time sex pain isn't *just* the hymen tearing, but is also the unfamiliarity with something large and swollen inserted into what is really a rather tight and smallish opening -- the first time, you can be tense and unable to relax due to the unfamiliarity of it all, which then goes to some pain. So if you want to reduce the pain aspect, get a dildo and just kind of acclimate yourself to something large inside of you. This would also answer your hymen question.
TwoXChromosomes X I was worried about it but first-time sex for me hardly hurt at all. My reasoning at the time was: "hopefully there'd be other fun things going on to take my mind off it, as opposed to having nothing to distract me."  The pain of the first time isn't even so much the hymen tearing as it is your vaginal walls clamping shut in nervousness. And there's not that much blood--just some spotting. It probably won't even get on the sheets--just the condom (and put a small pad in your underwear afterward just in case).  If you're really, really relaxed (with a trusted partner) and really, really turned on (ie, super lubricated) and he is careful and takes his time and eases you into it, it shouldn't be bad at all. Relaxation and comfort is key, though. As someone else said: hours of foreplay so you're really wet and happy and relaxed is your best bet.
CsectionCentral X wow the cord thing is very scary, so glad she was out quick and you are both healthy. long labors are rough. mine was 21, there was no cord worries but i was at 9 cm for 6 hours, he was just too big :P  take care
BabyBumps X Target has stretch jersey skirts (super comfy and will accommodate expansion however it plays out) and jersey kimono dresses right now. I got one of the dresses on clearance yesterday for $5!  Since they're not officially maternity, they're really cheap, and I'll get more mileage out of them later. 
BabyBumps X My doc told me the iron from our prenatals with the dark greens and proteins we should be getting can constipate us so make sure you're getting some fiber in your diet too.
BabyBumps X semen has prostaglandins in it, which soften up the cervix and allow it to dilate and thin out. the one time i managed to get frisky with my fiance at the end of my pregnancy, i had BH contractions for a solid hour and at my next visit i was another 1.5cm dilated. 
BabyBumps X Good luck. I'll be full term tomorrow and already am so ready, I can't even imagine. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, but at *much* less reliable rates than they prevent the spread of HIV, chlamydia, and the like. Because HPV is transferred through skin-to-skin contact, condoms are only about 50% effective. You should still use them, but you shouldn't think they mean you're really protected.
BabyBumps X I'm trying not to freak out to much about the weight gain. I did not gain most of my pregnancy weight until the middle of my second trimester. Pre-pregnancy weight was 119 pounds, right now I'm 140 pounds at 23 weeks. The photo shows my body shape at 21 weeks (left) compared to now at 23 weeks (right). It seems like a huge jump in shape change, so for peace of mind I'm curious if this is a normal weight gain and shape change?
BabyBumps X I agree it was hard eating that many but totally worth it. Last pregnancy I tried to do the drink and puked it up right after. It was horrible LOL!
BabyBumps X You must be very petite (not tall).  It seems like for 25 weeks, a 19 lbs weight gain would be acceptable.   If you stick at the ave. 1lb/week going forward you will still fall within that 30-35 healthy gain range my doctor told me about.    
BabyBumps X Dont worry about the weight yet. A lot of women lose in the first trimester, then slowly gain in the second. I lost tlbs in my first, then was only up a total of 6lbs by 20weeks. Now at 23lbs going into my 36th week. 
BabyBumps X Can you tell by movement at all? i felt hiccups down by my left hip, and constant kicking on/around my right ribs. I asked my Dr, who felt around and confirmed she was head down in my left hip area back around 28 weeks, which is what i suspected.
TwoXChromosome X _your-pregnancy-8-weeks_1097.bc  HMMMM well at 8 weeks they do have finger stubs.  However, the entire fetus is the size of a kidney bean.  Therefore, your picture is still inaccurate, otherwise over 50% of the fetus would be a hand.  A fetus is not a whole human organism.  Otherwise it could survive outside the womb.  It is not a "living member of the human species" otherwise it would live among human rather than live as part of a human.    You are welcome to argue with me in circles all you want, i have an obscene amount of stamina for this.  However, I will ask you YET AGAIN to stop spreading misinformation.
BabyBumps X Didn't have my ultrasound until week 21 so I got to hear the heartbeat at week 10 by doppler.  I think the machine showed the rate.  They said any earlier and it'd be too small or faint to pick up.
TwoXChromosomes X I have implanon, and while it technically does the job, it's taken over a year for my period to regulate.  The only way to combat permanent spotting while using implanon is....guess....birth control pills. I opted to wait.  It's been almost a year and a half, but it was a huge pain in the ass. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you have bad periods and live in the USA, your doctor will probably recommend Mirena (the hormonal IUD) instead of Paragard (the copper IUD). Mirena is easy to manage, and will make your periods easier, which sounds like what you are looking for.
TwoXChromosomes X I love the Diva Cup, but it can be a problem with a super-heavy flow. It can be very messy to empty, and it's embarrassing to come out of the stall with your hands covered in blood. 
BabyBumps X Awww I feel for you. The last four weeks of my pregnancy were the worst - I was convinced I was going to go early but Maya ended up being four days late, which isn't really very late at all. I drove myself mad with every twitch and pain in the end. I have no idea how dilated or effaced I was as it's not routinely checked here in the Uk. Oh - my "evidence" for Maya being early was that she "dropped" at about 35/36 weeks; this is supposedly a sign that baby will be born within two weeks for first time mums. What a load of rubbish!   Wishing you a very boring and relatively quick labour. xxx
BabyBumps X Favorite Part - Those moments when you realize you are growing a human. Inside you. Makes me feel like a magical unicorn.  Least Favorite - The little aches. Mostly because they are totally random, so something that worked one day will become totally unacceptable to do another day. 
BabyBumps X Aw man. I know that feel :( especially in the beginning like that! I was so worried alllllll the time. Plus, I got one ultrasound at 6 weeks and they saw a heartbeat, and I haven't had one since. My anatomy scan is the 18th though!  Personally, I bought a Sonoline B home Doppler and it has eased my fears sooooo much. I first heard the heartbeat at 9 weeks exactly and can listen to it anytime.  Btw, missed miscarriages are really really rare. Stop googling! Everything is fine :)!!!
BabyBumps X At a time when I couldn't afford to have a doctor's appointment to get a prescription, I learned about D-mannose. It's the same sugar in cranberry juice that helps get rid of UTIs. You might do some reading on it.  I've been using nothing but d-mannose sugar ordered online to get rid of any UTIs I've gotten in the last, oh, 5 years. It starts working within a day for me, tastes alright, and isn't terribly expensive per amount to get rid of one UTI. Plus you can take a teaspoon of it every day to prevent if you wish to. I was doing that after sex for a while, it did keep the UTIs away for me!  Good luck!!
TwoXChromosomes X Cost is one of the reasons I use cloth pads.  ( and no, i will not try the Diva Cup as even lite tampons are very uncomfortable for me. )
BabyBumps X That's exactly how I felt early on in my pregnancy. I figured I was going to be in a 'fat or pregnant?' stage forever. This was me at [26 weeks]( ). Now at almost 33 weeks I'm definitely pregnant looking. It's different for every woman. One thing I didn't appreciate about not really showing is the lack of weight on your abdominal muscles and the stretching. So enjoy every part while it lasts!
AskWomen X &gt; Also I could have oral herpes since I get cold sores.  ..What else do you think might be the reason you get cold sores?  Cold sores are oral herpes.  But most people have oral herpes (and asymptomatic HPV).  Also, the type of herpes that tends to infect the mouth tends not to infect genitals.    If you can, get her to shave.  I find the texture of skin *much* more pleasant in my mouth than hair.  And as long as she doesn't have some kind of infection, the taste should be very insignificant, although just after a shower isn't a bad way to start.
BabyBumps X The hospital will most likely give you everything on your list! They have witch hazel pads, sani pads, the peri bottle, breast pads, and nipple cream. I do think you might want to bring your own pads, whatever brand you prefer since the hospital's are probably generic. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think the only thing you can do here is to continue taking active pills during your placebo week. Not taking your pills when you require them can leave you unprotected and will confuse your body greatly.
TwoXChromosomes X Warn anyone you have sex with that there is a possibility that (if they are larger or in a position with deep penetration - such as doggy style) he may end up poking the wires, and although they are relatively soft, they are still a boner-killer.
AskWomen X Some STIs aren't preventable by a simple condom because it doesn't cover the rest of the genital area and if there is any kind of outbreak there could be transmission. And, sometimes the condom breaks. 
TwoXChromosomes X Frankly, I am far too lazy to pull that thing out of my vag, dump it, clean it, and then reinsert it. Throwing a tampon away seems cleaner, quicker, and more convenient, exactly the things I want when I am on my period. 
BabyBumps X I've had PUPPPS (pregnancy rash) for about three weeks now and have tried everything. I have used benadryl, calamine, hydrocortisone, oatmeal baths, lotion, aloe, etc. You shouldn't worry. :)  Edit: also, for the itch, I have found that ice packs work the best. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've seen this too, about pads. It's really strange to me. For a long time, I just couldn't make tampons work, and they weirded me out. And now that I can successfully use tampons, I still have to use pads for half the time because birth control has made my period much lighter - using tampons for a lighter flow means having to pull it out while it's still kind of dry (not comfy), even using it for the maximum time.   Maybe some people just need to feel superior about something.
TwoXChromosomes X I really wanted to go off hormonal birth control and had a paragard inserted. This was the best decision I think I've ever made! Getting it inserted was crampy, that day I took some ibuprofin and rested, the next day I was up and about with much less cramping, a little bit of spot bleeding. The cramps were gone by day 4 or 5 and the spot bleeding was over after my first period. My period was a little heavier for the first two months but went completely back to normal by month three. I think you should definitely get the paragard  Also: I hear mirena users rave about it, but if you've ever had a bad emotional reaction to hormonal birth control, I would be really careful. That usually happens because the hormone levels are too high or too low so if the mirena isn't the right amount of hormones for you, you could go kinda crazy. I heard some horror stories about it but i'm sure they are rare. Anyway, paragard does everything but take away your period and honestly, women are supposed to have a period! It's natural!  
BabyBumps X I feel you. My first was 12 days late and would have been another day or two if she hadn't been evicted by Pitocin. At least you're having contractions :) All I had was Braxton-Hicks. Won't be long for you now!
AskWomen X Condoms combined with birth control pill (or other hormonal birth control) -shots, implants, ring, whatever) and /or an IUD plus being ok with abortion if being as careful as possible doesn't work. 
TwoXChromosomes X No not at all! It's got a bigger diameter than most tampons, and you've never had one of those fall out (probably). Plus it's kind of like.. suctioned there? If that makes any sense? You have to break the seal to get it out when you want to.
BabyBumps X Ultrasounds can be kind of sketchy. You could still have a small bleed. Don't panic just yet, ok? They call just about any bleeding a "threatened miscarriage". My doc labeled my implant bleeding (at 7 weeks) as such.
beyondthebump X Our pediatrician was saying yesterday that it gets better.  Apparently when LO's are old enough to get really curious but want to keep eating they just keep the nipple in their mouth and try to take it with them as they turn their heads and such.  She said it HURTS LIKE A BITCH and if you yelp once usually they get the hint and never do it again.  Right now my daughter is in a "sipping" phase.  She will latch, eat, unlatch, look around some, latch, eat, unlatch, smile, latch, eat, unlatch, look around, latch, eat, unlatch, talk a bunch of babble, latch, etc. repeat FOREVER until she finally either latches or decides she's had enough and sometimes there's about 30 seconds in between each latch and unlatch.  My let down isn't as bad as it was in the beginning so I don't spray anymore but if i I did poor girl would be bathing in it.  And with all her latching and unlatching at this point (I don't own many nursing tops) if I nurse in public I have def. shared nipslips with those around me.  (I stopped using a nursing cover because LO didn't like things over her/touching her when she nursed.)
TwoXChromosomes X FYI they can be avoided by eating plain yogurt everyday. The bacteria in the yogurt helps keep the lady parts ph balanced
BabyBumps X If its bright red blood, you probably do have a hemorrhoid. Internal ones can happen without any other signs. Also possible, anal fissure.  Yes, still talk to your doctor.  Also, if its darker, like black poop, then there is probably something much further up in you. But bright red is indicative of bleeding just up inside the anus rather than further in your body.
TwoXChromosomes X I'd definitely err on the side of caution with this one. It does depend on the antibiotic, but it also depends on the type of birth control pill you're taking. I'm on the mini-pill (ortho micronor) and my GP, ob-gyn, and pharmacist all confirmed that antibiotics won't have any impact on how my pill works. Something about "gut flora" which manages to sound simultaneously gross and kind of pretty. Apparently the mini-pill is absorbed differently, so the weird stuff that goes down in your digestive tract when you're on antibiotics doesn't hurt it.   If you're on a regular combined pill, I'd use backup just to be on the safe side. No harm in doubling up for a while, especially if it puts your mind at ease. 
TwoXChromosomes X Hey - just because a lot of the posts in here have a lot to do with bleeding and pain - this isn't a given, and doesn't mean you're abnormal if it doesnt happen. my boyfriend had been penetrating me regularly with his fingers before we had intercourse, and it never made me bleed. if you are turned on, not afraid (and thus squeezing those muscles:this is important) and you've started out with a finger or three there might not be any pain at all. Remember sex is fun and doesn't have to be painful, even your first time!! The only time I had painful sex was when I tried to push too fast for a quicky when I wasn't turned on enough. Also, LUBE :)
TwoXChromosomes X Not to sound condecending btu you didn't break your hymen, [you stretched it!]( ?v=9qFojO8WkpA) 
TwoXChromosomes X I have found this to be true. I can't use any brand of pad but always. I have tried but always end up with a terrible diaper rash basically. The infinity ones are the best IMO, I hardly ever feel them there.   
BabyBumps X I was waiting for my OB visit and saw two twin babies that were a week old.  They were TINY but she said they were 100% perfectly healthy.  They only weighed 4 lbs each when they were born.  SO CUTE I could hardly stand it.  I wanted to be a crazy baby snatcher and just hold them all day.
TwoXChromosomes X As a fellow endo sufferer, I've done both the shot and the surgery. Surgery is totally worth it, and get a second opinion. I had to almost beg my surgeon to go through with it, and afterwords she told my husband she was glad they did. Any questions about Lupron or surgery, or endo or anything, feel more than free to PM me.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think it is healthy, hence me being stuck buying always radiance tangerine scented pads because thats all that was left as far as pads go.   They had tons of tampons.   I have tons of tampons.   My pad supply ran short.  But I *believe* you can sleep in a tampon as long as it doesn't exceed 8 hours and it is for the right flow ect ect. You can avoid TSS by following the general tampon rules. 
TwoXChromosomes X I bled a lot and it was painful the first time. I also had a gynecologist try to perform a bimanual exams on me when I was a virgin because of some cysts I had. He was unable to perform the exam and was able to tell that I had never had sex, so it is possible to tell on physical examination.
TwoXChromosomes X Go to another doctor and demand to be treated.  Anything that is debilitating needs medical treatment.  Some sort of hormonal birthcontrol is worth a try.  It usually makes periods lighter, shorter, and less intense.  I've had a hormonal IUD for a few months now, and I don't even get a period anymore.  
TwoXChromosomes X Short periods or lighter periods are normal. As long as you take at least 21 active pills and no more than 7 sugar pills you are protected from pregnancy. You can start a new pack if you want to but you don't need to.  You pharmacist is an excellent resource for all birth-control questions, and is normally easy and free to consult. Talk to them if you have any doubts.
CsectionCentral X I'll write up my story once we a have internet at our new place. I was well prepared that I was most likely having one so I was ready and not at all disappointed. She was breech and had no room to turn even had we felt the risks of manually turning her were worth it. I never labored, just went in and had my c section at 39 weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't see how pads are any safer.  Even after a few hours, the blood can dribble off to the side around the pad, even if it has wings.  Maybe it's time to wear both pad and tampon to bed lol
TwoXChromosomes X I bled more than I ever have from a period, and mine used to be heavy. When I realized and went to clean myself up in a bathroom stall, it felt like the blood was poring out of me. Not like a waterfall, but it was obvious I was bleeding, not getting my period. There was also what seemed to be tissue that came out, so now I'm really curious what that was... 
TwoXChromosomes X You can try it out! I would recommend using some lube or coconut oil to ease it in. It's also okay to start wearing it the day before you're supposed to get your period. Just remember you have it in :P  For extra protection, I will also recommend wearing some black underwear or having a panty liner while you work out the kinks for the first couple days. It's hard to know whether it will be leaky or not (if you have the seal right, for example) just by how it feels. I bought a cheapy $3 pack of 4 black pairs at Wal-mart and it has been the extra confidence I need during my period.
TwoXChromosomes X This made my vagina crawl even further inside me. During my last period I used 1 unscented Always pad (instead of NatraCare cotton pads) and I got a rash on my vulva; it was horrendous. I can't imagine how bad things would be if scents were added to the mix. I also get scent-triggered migraines, and I'm more prone to migraines during my period... so, yeah. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think you should include something about masturbation. About how sticking a dildo in yourself doesn't mean you aren't a virgin and that knowing your own body can make sex more pleasurable.
TwoXChromosomes X In my experience, they range from unpleasant to slightly painful, but I've never been sore for days from a routine exam. I'm sorry you've had this experience.   If you tell a doctor your previous exams were excruciatingly painful, they have several options to make things easier for you:   - use a smaller speculum (they make speculums for use on virgins and children),   - warm up the speculum if it's a metallic one,   - use lube,  - suggest a different position (you can be examined lying on your back with your feet in stirrups, or lying on your side with your knees to your chest and with the speculum inserted from behind),   - do as much of the exam as possible without the speculum first, using simply finger palpation...   If you think any of these changes could help, don't hesitate to bring them up. I hope you find someone who works with you!
TwoXChromosomes X Also include that taking a daily supplement of acidophilus prevents yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, and that it treats any infection that's already present. (Daily oral supplement, but a capsule can also work as a vaginal suppository to treat a yeast infection.)   Women *especially need to take* acidophilus supplements when they go on antibiotics! They kill all the good bacteria and leave our poor vages open to attack.  
TwoXChromosomes X Actually, it might be latex that doesn't go well with oils, not silicone. Oils break down latex and so condoms are prone to tearing if used with oil based lube.
TwoXChromosomes X It is not supposed to feel like that. Tell your doctor about it, as others have said, too. Hugs.   By the way, in the Netherlands women do not go for regular checkups at the gyno. A PAP smear every five years is all (as long as the results from that smear are normal; and of course you go if you have a complaint). I don't think we Dutch girls get more gynaecological problems because we don't do the checkups. 
BabyBumps X Depends.   I get "uncomfortable" around 14 weeks. That isn't the same uncomfortable as later. It's just a "this doesn't feel normal" discomfort not a "why am I carrying a huge rock in my stomach and trying not to let it fall out of my vagina?" discomfort.  Also, my SPD and SI joint pain starts early. This isn't "normal" but also not particularly abnormal. This is more pain than discomfort though.
BabyBumps X I've been given, like, 5 dates.  So...somewhere between August 26th and September 4th.  I'm just planning to have this baby out of me by September 10th, so when it happens earlier, I'll be pleasantly surprised.
AskWomen X She needs to get to the doctor/hospital - just in case. Ectopic pregnancies can cause hemorrhage and death.  I'm not trying to scare you, but if there's _any_ chance of it being an EP, she needs to be seen now. A little inconvenience of dealing with a doctor is better than being in a medical emergency and not having help. Tell her she probably needs to get going on this.  Info about it including signs and symptoms- _pregnancy 
AskWomen X I actually went to two different doctors. Both said they were migraines. I switched to a low dose pill, the migraines stopped for a bit, however recently they've returned. 
BabyBumps X I had an induction at 42.5 weeks and it hurt A LOT then i got an epidural and slept until I needed to deliver. Then I just felt like I had to poop but, no, it was labor. Just relax. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's no different that the "small penis" insecurity men have: if the girl really loves you, she isn't going to care how big your dick is.  Same thing for this :)
beyondthebump X Baby started sucking on his hand at 3 weeks old, and we decided to give him a pacifier.  You can take a pacifier away, but that thumb will be there forever.  It would be a much more difficult habit to break when he's older.  We got several different kinds of pacifiers/soothers at our baby shower, and Baby likes the one I got free for buying maternity clothes the best.  Go figure.
beyondthebump X Just had this discussion with my doctor/lactation consultant. Little one is getting fussy because she wants to suck but is full... she tries to- overfills, spills it up and then gets angry because she wants to suck still!! So she suggested I use a pacifier sometimes. So far so good :) Not going to stop frequent feeding totally, but going to try and determine when she is comfort sucking, and swap the nipple for the paci when I can.   Before I had her I SWORE I wouldn't use one, but it just seems like the right thing to do for her right now.
BabyBumps X I'm 20 weeks and 3 days and I only feel light flutters usually.  Every time I try to "feel" for it with my hand I only feel my heart beat.    When I'm not trying to feel for it, I feel movement.  Troll baby!
AskWomen X You don't actually have to forcibly rinse out your vagina, ever, in fact that really upsets its natural homeostatic balance. The vagina is, conveniently, a self-cleaning organ and overly-thorough as well as overly-frequent washing is detrimental to its balance of pH and natural flora.   What you're doing is perfectly adequate and sanitary, respectful to the internal environment of your nether regions. On that note, douches are a terrible invention. 
beyondthebump X The Mam is my baby's favorite as well, and we've tried several.  Plus, it's designed by pediatric dentists and orthodontists!  I figure weaning from a pacifiervis much easier than thumb sucking.  After all, you can take a pacifier away.
AskWomen X I like giving my partner pleasure in bed, and I think blow jobs, at least in all my past sexual encounters, have been more about giving pleasure than being degrading or anything.
beyondthebump X As far as the bleeding goes... I bled on and off for 8 weeks... THEN I finally started a real period. It was so much annoying.
TwoXChromosomes X Nope. You can get the implant regardless if you have been on previous birth control. It's a totally different chemical that can have totally different side effects but works in the same way. A friend of mine got the implant as her first ever form of birth control.  Edit: I'm also getting the implant with the copper iud as my only previous BC.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, I did. They're both cases of discrimination and they're both illegal and neither of them are OK.   &gt;Making it clear that you don't serve people who have health risks is more than OK.  No, its not. Unless you are that woman you don't get to make any decisions for her at all. 
TwoXChromosomes X Don't let her scare you out of the IUD, they almost always put up a fuss with women who haven't had a child yet because of the risk of PID and other issues. I haven't had one but I HAVE had catheters placed through my cervix, can't say it hurt too much. For some women there is pain but it's only while placing it.  I was on hormonal BC pills for a year. Found out I have a fairly common blood clotting disorder that makes being on pills extremely dangerous. Never again. Go with the non hormonal IUD if you can!
BabyBumps X No worries mama - I had braxton hicks contractions a LOT with my first.  You should be fine.
beyondthebump X I've read a lot of great advice already.  Here's what I would add... At about 2 weeks, two things happened for me / my baby:   (1) my raging hormones -- wild mood swings, feeling like I couldn't take it etc. peaked at about 2 weeks PP. I would say that since you have come this far, give yourself at least a couple more weeks to push through.  You can always switch then, but really, that frustration will ease off.    (2) growth spurt.  Baby was fussy and I couldn't keep up.  We had other feeding issues and had to supplement with formula -- but I just wanted to add that fussiness could be a growth spurt.   The attached to the boob / feeling too needed thing passes.  Your baby will get super efficient and in not too long (a few more weeks), will probably be eating only every few hours and for 20 minutes at a stretch.  You are at the most difficult point right now. If you push through, you will make it, and then the boob cuddles and boob smiles are really just awesome.  One option that really helped us was that my husband would give a bottle in the evening and I would take some "me" time. We had to supplement, but since your pumping works well, you could just add a pump session or two in and let your boyfriend take the little man for a few hours.
BabyBumps X For me it was like a period type pain almost constantly then when the contractions started it was like someone had a vice round my pelvis and they were tightening it and tightening it untill I felt like it was about to become unbareable then it was slowly being loosened 
TwoXChromosomes X Depending on your insurance, you might want to look into Lysteda or something similar. I have really heavy bleeding and cramping from the IUD and Lysteda makes it much more bearable. Also, from my experience, "the worst pain I've ever felt in my life" seems like an understatement. Good on you for being able to deal with it without becoming a sobbing sack of pain like I did. :)
BabyBumps X I made the U/S tech repeatedly poke and prod and readjust the little wand thingy JUST to be sure it was a girl.  I was like "are you sure there's no little willy hidden somewhere in there..?"  Congrats on the gender find XD
TwoXChromosomes X I was waiting to see if someone brought this up! Alcohol and tobacco are not the same. Moderate alcohol use (one drink a day or less) hasn't been shown to be harmful to a pregnancy. ANY tobacco use is harmful to a pregnancy. I would feel much more comfortable refusing to serve hooka to a pregnant woman that refusing to serve alcohol. It's actually been shown that moderate  alcohol consumption can be [beneficial]( -drinking-pregnant-women.html)!
TwoXChromosomes X Get yourself checked for endometriosis and cysts. Both can be incredibly painful. Endometriosis can affect fertility. Cyst pain usually subsides  if/when they subside or break.   Good luck! 
TwoXChromosomes X I have endo and ovarian cysts. I actually had surgery on 6/12/12 for both.  I know you say you don't have insurance, but it really needs to be checked out. Is there a Planned Parenthood close to you? I was diagnosed at 13 with both, but I ignored it for the past 4-6 years which is why I had the surgery today/yesterday. There are things that they can try to help alleviate the symptoms, but there is no cure.  Birth Control, Pain Medication and something called Depo Lupron, which induces temporary menopause to stop you from having periods. 
TwoXChromosomes X You are not at all selfish! I personally think its wrong to describe *anyone* as being selfish because they want to wait to have a child, don't want one at all, etc. What you want is very, very important, as is being ready to have a child. Obviously sometimes circumstances make you be ready a lot sooner than you planned, but if at all possible, wait until you actually want a child yourself. Don't try to force yourself into your husband's plan. Talk to him about how you feel on all this.
BabyBumps X This is my first and I feel a little bit like this. Makes me feel horrible because some people are so 'I can't wait to meet my little angel lovebug! I love you so much already little one!' and while I do love her already, it's not some over the top crazy momma love yet.   I'm also not super worried or paranoid the way some pregnant women seem to be. I guess I figure that pregnancy happens every day to countless women and has been going on since the beginning of time. Being pregnant myself has totally changed my perspective on it, and definitely given me a new respect for all mothers, but I don't feel incredibly special.   I also forget that I'm pregnant almost on a daily basis. It's getting harder to forget but I definitely still have moments where I am reminded and it freaks me out all over again.   Of course, I have moments of total excitement or find myself giggling when she's rolling around inside me. I guess we're all just different!
BabyBumps X So funny!  That's exactly where mine likes to curl up. She almost never ventures over to my left side, and I'm pretty sure my tummy is going to stay lopsided after delivery....  she's been better about the kicking though so I feel better with her there now than I did a couple of weeks ago. :). 
BabyBumps X I was told at week 22 to aim for a 25 lb weight gain (I'm very, very short).  Well, I'm at 26 weeks, and I just got weighed today - I've gained 18 lbs already.  I have 3 months to go.  So.... I guess no more ice cream and bagels for me.
BabyBumps X First was at 40 weeks 2 days, 10 hours labor, water broken by doctor at 9.5 cm, 1.5 hrs pushing, just over 7 lbs.  Second was at 39 weeks 2 days, 7 hours labor, water broke naturally sometime after 8 cm, time from 6 cm to birth about 2.5 hours, pushed for 15 minutes, just under 8 lbs.  In most ways my second birth was much easier, but the contractions were harder and faster and everything happened VERY quickly at the end.
TwoXChromosomes X To an unoccupied room, libraries have tons of them. To a study nook, libraries have tons of them. Or she could have asked them if there was a room they could direct her to. Bottle fed doesn't expose a breast to the public, so not an adequate comparison... unless the parent needed to be topless to feel comfortable bottle feeding their child. 
TwoXChromosomes X For me, there was the initial bump of passing over the cervix, and then a second where it hits the back of the vagina and kind of tilts up, like it is clicking.  Then I would check placement by making sure my cervix was centered in the cup.  
TwoXChromosomes X This has always bothered me a bit. It's good that they test, but there are reasons why this isn't really as wonderful as you might think. Herpes isn't tested for in standard STI testing. HIV has a bit of lag (1-3 months) between infection and detectability with testing. There are drug resistant strains of gonorrhea around. This isn't stuff to take lightly.
TwoXChromosomes X Don't take this the wrong way because I am totally in favor of women being in control of their own bodies, but do you think that sterilization will stop you from getting your period every 20 days? Because there is a really good chance it won't, they just might be lighter without the copper. If this is your only problem, why not try lysteda? It's non-hormonal.
AskWomen X I got the diva cup and absolutely love it. It got rid of my bad cramps, and made me feel less icky. I haven't ever had an issue with a full blown leak, although I wear a pantyliner with it, and it's saved my menstruating life.
BabyBumps X I'm pro choice...  I would *never* do this myself, but apart from ectopic pregnancy, I believe I would never abort any baby I became pregnant with, even if there were issues like hydrocephaly or such where the child's Outlook is bleak. I suppose of course, my opinion may change if I were ever put in that situation.  As for if I would look down on others for doing this? I don't feel I have the right. It's not my child, my child's life, my emotional well-being, my life. It's not up to me to decide what is right for someone else.
BabyBumps X No facebook posts for me, as I don't want many people showing up at the hospital while or right after I'm in labor besides my close family. I want to be able to spend some time with the baby in a peaceful setting without the hustle and bustle of people coming in to see him. Plus I want to breastfeed and there's no way I'll be doing that with a crowd surrounding.   Plus, my SO's mother is a nightmare and do not want her around in the hospital at such a special time. I've already discussed with my SO and he understands, so. 
BabyBumps X Special needs children are some of the happiest I have ever met! Also, I've never met a parent to a special needs child that didn't say that their child was the biggest blessing in their life. I agree that I would give every life a chance. It wouldn't be easy, but raising a healthy baby wouldn't be easy either :)
TwoXChromosomes X Pregnant twice, one child - I terminated the second pregnancy the same day I got the IUD put in. My periods are pretty nonexistent, like the first day when your period's just gearing up, but it never progresses past that. I use the Mirena, but only because I'm allergic to copper, and my insurance covered it. I think it was about $500 before my benefits kicked in?  Honestly I love it. I feel like it evened me out in ways that the ring and the pill never did. I highly recommend it. 
AskWomen X I have tried the Nuvaring and the BC Patch. Nuvaring would actually come out for me during sex which made it...fairly ineffective, but I know people who love it.   However, both the Nuvaring and the patch have higher levels of hormones that can make them less safe. My gyno eventually took me off the patch for that reason.   But I totally agree with Graenn, you should research them and talk with a doctor. 
AskWomen X I don't understand why they wouldn't recommend using both the pill and a condom. Just because it can be very effective for many women doesn't mean that having a second line of defense is a bad thing. Not to mention a condom protects against things besides pregnancy. 
TwoXChromosomes X You can take an early pregnancy test 5 days before your missed period. With every day that goes by if you are pregnant, the hcg levels in your urine double and you will be more and more likely to test positive. If your period is a week late, a pregnancy should definitely tell you if you are pregnant or not. 
BabyBumps X I don't know how I would act if I stood before this choice of carrying a child with disability to term or abort. I like to think, I would never feel the need to abort, but then I wasn't in a situation to abort. I also like to think I would abort a terminal ill fetus, but then I don't know if I would be able to. I don't know and only can hope to never find out under which circumstances I would abort a pregnancy.  I know one woman with three kids, first one mild health issues, second one disabled and she did torough testing while pregnant with her youngest to be able to abort if it were disabled since she couldn't care for another disabled child. I like to think this is a reasonable stance, only doing genetic testing if the outcome changes ones mind, and hope I can muster her strenght if I come ever in a similar situation. 
AskWomen X Because stories like yours freak me the hell out, were there any indications that your body didn't tolerate your IUD? And which type did you have, copper or Mirena?
Parenting X If I was the mother in question, I would allow the father to take him for a couple of hours somewhere between 4-6 months of age. Especially if the baby is breastfed. My current baby (my third) refuses to take a bottle, so I could not leave him until he went longer in between feedings. Now that he is 9 months and eating baby food, I can leave him even longer, but not overnight. 
BabyBumps X I'm almost 31 weeks now and it still hasn't really sunk in... I think I'm one of those people that won't feel like it's "real" until the baby actually comes out of me. Not sure.  I like the ultrasounds; I like feeling the baby, but at the same time... I still feel so detached from it all. But still really excited! It's a weird feeling. haha
BabyBumps X My baby is an transverse breech right now, she has been since about 27 weeks, I am 33 weeks now, she still has time to flip and I really hope she does. Otherwise I am on a one-way ticket to the OR - which ultimately I am fine with, as long as she is safe and healthy.   My preference is for her to get head down and for me to have a vaginal delivery - but I am okay with the idea that I may have to have a caesarian too. 
BabyBumps X I'm kinda hoping I get an exact due date baby just because... *July 4th*!! Plus, then my husband will get to do his dream of quoting the movie Independence Day (or just watching it) during labor, lol. And I kind of wouldn't mind because we're both super nerd fans of the movie.  But the 20th is the earliest because then hubbie will have enough time off to stay home until family arrives. And the 13th is when family arrives... My midwife told me today to make sure that I pack a bag now because if I don't I'll go into labor early, lol. Apparently the practice is big on superstition. He kind of blanched when I told him when the next full moon was... (July 3)
BabyBumps X I was in semi-denial. I kept telling my hubby - it takes months and months before anything can happen and then BAM a month later I was pregnant. /:)
BabyBumps X I'll admit, I have you tagged as a 'due date twin' along with a few other ladies.   And oh boy, SO passing out is NOT at all part of the birth plan, lol!
BabyBumps X there were so many babies this week O_o, I lost track.  I'm just hoping for cute baby photos soon!
TwoXChromosomes X Instead of taking the placebos ("sugar pills"), she went straight on to the next pack.
TwoXChromosomes X It can be that, or it can be that it's just taken some time for your body to decide that nah, this isn't working. Side effects doesn't always come instantaneous, especially not with birth control. I'd say talk things over with a gyn and switch brands.
BabyBumps X Smart baby!  Renee will sometimes listen too.  At the anatomy scan my tech was focused on her legs, and told her to kick me real good so she could get a video.  Sure enough Renee pulled back her leg and then popped me nice and hard.  Sometimes I really do wonder what their comprehension level is in utero.
TwoXChromosomes X :) I dunno what kind of tampons you use cause I live in Australia and our tampons dont have applicators so you need to lick your finger before inserting it other wise it wont go in properly.   If you use to american tampons with the plastic tube around them try and use tampons without that tube thingy if you can feel the tampon its not in correctly
TwoXChromosomes X When is the absolute latest you believe a child should be aborted? When does brain activity begin in fetuses?  Also, following the whole "baby endangering the mother's life" idea, do hospitals save the mother at the expense of the baby's life? Even up to childbirth? Is this something you approve of?
TwoXChromosomes X Because if they consider a sufficiently developed fetus a human being (i.e. they don't gain the trait of humanity by some part of them exiting a vagina) then aborting beyond that point is murder.
TwoXChromosomes X Makes sense. I agree that there is a range where it is quite unacceptable to abort a child (8 months is, to me, an obvious point at which it is morally reprehensible considering a child can still be delivered at that stage). Actually, I think I read somewhere that 23 weeks can leave a baby viable outside the womb, though whether it is/can be conscious or not is another story. If a 20 week baby was outside the womb (had to be removed for safety of the mother or what have you and no decision had been yet made concerning its future) and fully capable of becoming a healthy human, would you have it aborted?  I was wondering about the idea of considering the fetus or whatever not as an "agent" but a probable one. That is, I wondered what the difference was, really, between killing someone and killing the high probability of a person existing? Of course, this same argument could be made about contraceptives, assuming the time was right, but I would think that probability increases over time of the fetus becoming an agent in the world, besides increasing consciousness or brain activity. Of course, a variety of factors contribute to any particular situation.  Also, about abortions at any stage to save the life or health of the mother, could this logic not be applied to the death penalty? It is essentially the abortion of society's mistake for the increased health and safety of that society, isn't it?
TwoXChromosomes X After 24 weeks is generally considered the age of viability, a baby born from 24 weeks old will generally be resuscitated and given intensive care, and from there chance of survival is quite high though disabilities are common. Basically I feel that from then on the baby could survive were it not inside the mother, and so aborting after that point for non-medical reasons just isn't right. 
AskWomen X this this this! I've been a cup user since 2005 and never going back! I've used pads for years, and then tampons, and now menstrual cups (I've used the divacup and now use the lunette) and I won't have it any other way. 
BabyBumps X Aww congratulations!! Regarding the ultrasound, I doubt they would change your due date. At this point they can be off +/- 2 weeks, so unless they are off more then 2-2.5 weeks the will keep your due date as is (especially if you had an ultrasound in your first trimester, because that is the most accurate one, when all babies embryos develop the same). 
TwoXChromosomes X If you're planning on having PIV sex, this is definitely a reason not to continue something. Birth control fails. 
TwoXChromosomes X Canada has no abortion laws. None. There are no restrictions on who, when, or why. And yet third trimester abortions are not performed frivolously because *no one wants a frivolous third trimester abortion*. No woman goes through six months of a healthy and safe pregnancy so that she can have a painful, risky, and traumatic abortion. It's never happened, because if it had, it would be news.  As well, frivolous abortions are limited by the doctors who will perform them. By and large, Canadian hospitals try to have at least one doctor on staff who will perform abortions, but not every hospital manages to hire one. They aren't lining up to move to the territories, for example. And Qubec's medical establishment has been trying for years to recruit a doctor who will perform medically necessary third trimester abortions, and haven't been able to find one. Because they're upsetting and gross and risky. People just don't sign up for that job.  We don't need to outlaw things that people don't want to do. And placing limits on second or third trimester abortions because they might be frivolous places barriers in the way of women who need them for "legitimate" reasons.
BabyBumps X My birth class coach taught us all relaxation techniques, even if you want all the drugs,because until you're really progressing,you'll need to know how to manage your pain. And since you really don't go to the hospital until your contractions are 5 minutes apart for more than an hour (unless your water breaks), some of the laboring is done at home and you will want to know how to deal with it there too. 
BabyBumps X I am 17 weeks. My doctor so far has just been really unhelpful and I feel like I'm better suited to have a midwife anyway. It will still be in a "hospital" but one with a more alternative options than what is being offered to me now. So best of both worlds. 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, first off I just want to make sure you realize that I was just stating the opinion of (some) people who are pro-life, not expressing my own opinion... The problem is, there's a continuum here and a lot of moral grey area between an zygote and a newborn baby... so to me the question is, *when* does the fetus go from part of your body to it's own entity? I do not agree with people who say "as soon as it becomes a zygote", but I sure as hell don't agree with people who say "not until it's born", either. I think either stance is taking the easy way out.  Practically speaking, it doesn't matter if the baby can be considered a separate entity as soon as it's an embryo, because you won't even know it's there to abort.  Say someone is on the ball, and they get an abortion at four weeks. The embryo is basically two layers of cells. It's not really anything. I'm guessing most of the people who would condemn an abortion at this point are religious.  Okay, but what if it took you six weeks to get in to the clinic? Now this little thing has a rudimentary heart, and is starting to develop a tongue and vocal chords.  Now imagine you don't have your shit together and it takes you eight weeks from conception to get your abortion. Well, now it's beginning to develop a brain, and imo thats where things start to get murky.  I'm sure you can extrapolate from there. Where do you think it's fair to draw the line between part of your own body, and a separate being?  edit: [source]( -development-images-6-weeks) and another [source]( _induced_abortion.html). Also had to fix grammar because I suck.
TwoXChromosomes X Erm, that's what I was pointing out. Rapechild is saying many pro-lifers are against almost all abortions, but that they will make an exception for rare horrible cases, such as the pregnancy that resulted in Rapechild. I can see how they find that vaguely unsettling/offensive.
TwoXChromosomes X I am not a doctor, but I've had a lot of experience with UTIs, unfortunately. I would absolutely ask your doctor about what my urologist recommended:  I was in a very similar boat, to the extent that I went to see a urologist to make sure I didn't have physical issues with my urethra and bladder. After getting the all-clear from him on those fronts, he gave me a six week regimen to follow:  Take 1 macrobid every night AT BEDTIME. He said that most docs will not tell you this, but the antibiotic is most effective when you take it at bedtime, as that this when you'll be holding urine for the longest amount of time.  No p-in-v intercourse for those six weeks.  Avoid diuretics. This includes tea, coffee, and pop.  Start taking a cranberry or a vitamin c supplement.  He also gave me these tips:  Stay hydrated! Concentrated urine is very susceptible to UTIs. Drink a TON of water.   Don't hold your urine if you have access to a bathroom.  Have you and your partner do a wipe down of your genital areas before sex. And make sure you pee after sex, always.  Hopefully the tips help. I followed the doc's recommendations and was UTI free for close to a year. Then I got lazy with staying hydrated and got another one. Now I keep a water bottle close at all times.
TwoXChromosomes X [This might help]( -increase-female-sexual-desire-herbs/).  And I would get off the BC, if I were you. BC had a similar effect on my libido and it had other unpleasant side effects as well. Have you considered an IUD? They are very safe these days and more effective than BC, and you can get the non-hormonal type. 
TwoXChromosomes X its the iud. I had very similar issues as you, and within 2 mins of getting the paragard iud out, I stopped cramping and I havent cramped in 2 cycles.
BabyBumps X I had IVF so I had to take vaginal progesterone suppositories for the first 12 weeks along with vaginal estrogen. They were messy and not my favorite but I'm 29 weeks now with a big healthy boy who is measuring 2 weeks ahead.
TwoXChromosomes X Word of advice- wear a panty liner or thong panty liner too. Sometimes blood travels down the string, or you hit max absorbency and there's a little leak. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have had symptoms very similar to what you have... turns out I had a cyst on one of my ovaries that was getting twisted up in my intestines during cramp time, and that's what caused the severe pain. Have you had an ultrasound of the stuff up in there to see what's going on?
TwoXChromosomes X No. A one day old zygote is not a baby. A three week old fetus is not a baby. A nine month of fetus is arguably a baby. That is why late-term abortions aren't legal. Science has yet to figure out when a fetus turns into a baby, but we can look at day one and month nine and say that the fetus is not the same, even though we don't know when it becomes not the same.
TwoXChromosomes X If you've not tried minipills I would definitely recommend it. I also had periods that lasted 8-11 days and were accompanied with debilitating cramps and the freezing cold spells you describe. I was on microgynon which reduced symptoms a bit but didn't remove them... then a doctor randomly suggested going on the mini pill and it has changed my life. I literally haven't had a period in like 8 months, it is incredible. I have had a couple of spells of spotting for a few days (i think i can attribute this to taking the pill late) but other than that it has been plain sailing. If you are worried about remembering to take the pill at the same time every day, try just setting an alarm on your phone, that's how i remember mine. 
TwoXChromosomes X Some people argue that, if there is something very very wrong with the baby and it will only suffer and die slowly, it's better to euthanize the baby than let it suffer. It's already fairly common practice to deny medical intervention for babies who are terminally ill and in pain with no hope of recovery. Some people call that "after-birth abortion", usually people who are opposed to it.
BabyBumps X I was planning to switch to a midwife, but ended up liking my OB so much I'm staying with her! I am planning to hire a doula to be there as well.
BabyBumps X Personally, I don't remember distinctly having that feeling (I had an epidural), but I obviously would have no idea if I would have otherwise.  I think it was mostly just because I was way too exhausted to feel anything but relief (over 30 hours of labor, and no sleep), also if anything, I think the pitocin interfered with it since that's synthetic oxytocin.  However, I totally felt an instant bond with my son and would not put him down those first few hours, I didn't even go to sleep.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah I remember when I got mine it was the most painful experience of my life. I couldn't walk the first day and just laid in bed.  For three days I was in this extreme pain and had to take wayyyy more than the recommended amount of aleve a day.  For a month I had pretty bad cramps every day but they were manageable, they would usually start when I was walking between classes on campus so I guess the brisk walking caused it.  Still, I think it was worth it. I always had really bad cramps to the point that I would throw up/couldn't walk but after the first month of having my paraguard I don't have cramps anymore and my periods are lighter! Also I don't like the idea of using hormones and taking a pill everyday.  I still use condoms though as backup because just like with the pill there's ALWAYS a chance you could get pregnant...doesn't hurt to be extra careful.
AskWomen X Stupid question but do I need a prescription from my doctor to get my hands on birth control pills? 
TwoXChromosomes X Oh god my Paragard experience was awful too. They told me to schedule an appointment when I had my period. So I called as soon as I got it, but the soonest they were able to get me in was a few days after that. My period at that point was super short cause my cycles were all weird from being on Depo for 6 months (after bleeding straight through those 6 months and well past that...) so when I got there my period was over. The woman doing it said my cervix was almost completely closed, but she decided to try insert it anyway instead of me making another appointment. It was the most horrible, stabbing, achey feeling ever, to the point where I started crying and almost passed out, and apparently I was bleeding quite a bit too. Then I had to drive myself home right after she finished! Fun times _ It's been about 6 months since it was put in and I don't think my body has fully adjusted yet-the cramps are horrible and my periods are always way too heavy :(
BabyBumps X I went to a 12 series class (Bradley Method) and am technically still going. It ends after my due date so we'll see if I make through the end. I feel much better even now with the classes I've taken so far. I've got a lot of confidence going into the period where labor can happen any time now.   Even though I haven't given birth, a lot of the medical interventions are covered and covered in depth by my class. I feel like I'd be able to make very educated decisions about my labor if I were to need to be in the hospital for birth.
TwoXChromosomes X Everywhere where FGM is practiced, MGM is also practiced. Both are performed in the same hygienic environment by people with the same medical education and even exactly the same medical tools.
TwoXChromosomes X Are you on hormonal birth control??? Antibiotics can interfere with the effectiveness of the pill and you are supposed to double up with condoms during use. Take a test! 
BabyBumps X I am planning to go with the flow. That said, I'll try to have as much of an intervention-less birth as possible, but I am aware anything can happen. Definitely will discuss with the MD when it's time; most likely will just request to have them wait until I initiate a request (for pain meds, for example) for intervention.  My main goal is to just to have a live baby and that I'm alive at the end. I don't have a "perfect" birth envisioned, so it won't hurt me if I must have an intervention.  The ONLY reason I'm thinking about even having a birth plan is to have something for the medical staff to refer to, and so I don't have to repeat all my preferences all the time, especially during a shift change. However... I'm kind of lazy so most likely won't have a birth plan.
BabyBumps X You're not the only one.  I don't even know if my Doctor will be at the hospital when I go into labor... she is only there 3 times a week.  I'll probably just have nurses.  *high five* no midwife!  I don't know anyone from the U.S. that used a midwife (I'm from the midwest) and they all have healthy babies.  I do like the idea of being in a natural environment more so all hospitaly but that is just one's preference.
BabyBumps X My baby came 5 weeks early so I went with the flow. I gave birth vaginally and although I didn't get the birth experience I wanted he is healthy, happy and thriving.
TwoXChromosomes X GO TO THE DOCTOR and get your urine tested.  I was struggling with recurrent UTIs early this year and went to the Dr, gave a pee sample and got a script for some antibiotics for the common bacteria behind a UIT.  Got called back in however as the organism that was in my pee was very unusual and highly resistant to most antibiotics so had to go on a long course of another type.    If I didn't go and find out exactly what was causing it, it may well have ended up in my bladder and I in hospital.    UTIs are NOT something to mess around with or underestimate, they can escalate quite quickly.    Good luck! And by some water based lube - will be much better for your vagina I think. 
TwoXChromosomes X Do you have Mirena?  If so, you might be waiting a while.  I also have Mirena.  Last year, I had 4 periods during the year, and 3 of those could have been considered spotting.  A common side effect of Mirena is light to no periods.  
TwoXChromosomes X It may not be yeast if it's persistent and an OTC anti-fungal like clotrimazole or miconazole doesn't help. I'd go get swabbed for bacterial vaginosis. It's possible you have both, so symptoms may improve but not go away.
Parenting X * I nursed on demand * I cluster fed.  My daughter was practically on the boob all day, every day for a month  * It didn't hurt but yes it was hard - but I loved *every* minute of it * I had a lactation consultant * I was one of the few who could not meet the demand and was advised to supplement with formula  Breastfeeding was the second most beautiful thing I ever did in my life aside from giving birth.  When my milk eventually stopped and I had to feed my daughter formula, that is the part that hurt me the most.  I was fortunate in that breast feeding was natural to me and did not cause me any pain.  My original point is that there are some of us who physically just can't continue. Milk *can* stop in some women and my Dr. believes my large fibroids and the myectomy during the c-section had a lot to do with it.  We don't need the added guilt on top of it.
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely go to a doctor.  It may be a yeast infection (I've had plenty in my day), which can be caused by having too much sugar or antibiotics.  Your doctor will have a much better idea than I would, but it's a good starting point.
TwoXChromosomes X could be some type of bacterial infection or a yeast infection - some meds cause yeast infections.  I got a nasty one that way when i was your age and it took TWO boxes of monetarist to get rid of it lol  Or it might be normal - discharge changes appearance during different times of the month and maybe what you think is smelly discharge might just be from the summer heat or something  Either way, you dont wanna fool around with this stuff.  Call your doc so he/she cah take a look.  If it's an infection you dont want it to become worse because if it becomes a blood infection it can be fatal.  DOn't worry, doctors see ladybits all the time, it's no big deal to them
TwoXChromosomes X The only way to know for sure is to get swabbed. Try an OTC yeast treatment like monistat, but if it doesn't help in a day or two I would strongly recommend seeing a doctor. BV symptoms can mimic a yeast infection and not everyone gets a smell. The fact that other home remedies aren't working points to onof two things... either it's the wrong/not enough remedy or it's not a yeast infection. If it's already been a couple weeks you could just be prolonging the suffering. OTC treatments are designed to work in 1 to 7 days.   Anyway, just my 2 cents. -bacterial-vaginosis.htm
BabyBumps X I went to mine at weeks 34 and 35 (2 Saturdays).  I learned a bit, but most was review from my own research.  However...my husband learned a ton, and it really changed how he was thinking he would handle labor, in a good way, so it was definitely worth it just for that alone.
TwoXChromosomes X Make sure to apply plain yogurt to the vulva as well (this is easier to do at night).  Sometimes a yeast infection can go awry and you have to treat the vuvla and vagina.  Honestly, I would do a yogurt treatment for two solid weeks.  Your discharge should be weird because you'll have your natural discharge plus yogurt.  Try the treatment for two weeks (remember to apply some yogurt to the vulva and changing the yogurt tampons super frequently to get a fresh application often).  Then go for one free week (week 3).  Hopefully you'll be better by then.  The longest I would try the yogurt treatment is three weeks (and then yogurt free on your fourth).  If you're still having problems, definitely see a doctor.  They can prescribe you heavy duty meds (which work most of the time) OR you may have something other than a yeast infection.  Perhaps it's PID or an STI?  Only a doctor can tell you for sure.  Good luck! (and I hope you feel better soon!)
BabyBumps X I spotted just a tiny bit at 8 weeks (I think it was 8).  It was no big deal however my Dr. said if it was a flow like a period to come back immediately.  I do know it is possible to bleed and have everything be okay, you just don't know until you see a doctor hun :/  I would go to the ER if your Dr. can't see you right away.
BabyBumps X Well said!   Most people do have a birthing plan whether they realize it or not. Some are more elaborate then others but eh, whatever floats that persons boat. If it makes you feel better to be that prepared then so be it. Just don't be surprised if things don't go as planned. I had wanted a vaginal birth with my son, but I was pre-e and had to have an emergency csection. This time around I have to schedule a csection again because of my history and my bp is already out of whack. So much for a VBAC. 
TwoXChromosomes X Please stop limiting my first ammendment rights. Limiting what I can say is just as harmful as limiting what I can choose to do with my own body. But that's a whole different issue.
TwoXChromosomes X I also have dysplasia. I just wanted to give you this bit of info to expand on momble's already great response: my doctor informed me that in 85% of cases of women under the age of 30, those pre-cancerous (dysplasic) cells will go away completely on their own. In other words, in 85% of those cases, those cells do not lead to cancer.  I'm not going to lie and say the biopsy was a treat (it wasn't awful but not great), but other than that, don't worry too much unless the doctor says there is a need to worry.
TwoXChromosomes X My very first pap smear came back with that exact diagnosis.  They did a biopsy to test for HPV which came back negative.  I've had normal pap smears ever since.  Chances are whatever it is will correct it's self.  You may have to get a few extra paps done (I think I got two a year until I had 5 normal ones or something arbitrary like that).  No need to worry just yet!
TwoXChromosomes X I had this before, as well.   Cervical dysplasia doesn't necessarily mean any of those scary things you are thinking. Cervical dysplasia simply mean there are abnormal cells in your cervical lining that they need to further look at.   Hmm.. imagine it as an odd mole you found. It doesn't necessarily mean cancer--it just means you need to get it looked at.   Heh... I am a very paranoid person, so when my doctor told me about dysplasia (mine was at a high level), I insisted that he shared with me everything he knew about it. I made him draw a diagram and everything.   When it is still at mild, you can still get it taken care of very easily. Though where I am from, the doctors here do not recommend any procedure unless there is more than mild dysplasia. Don't worry about it! 
TwoXChromosomes X It's not that bad at all.  They lead you into the room, as give you a hospital gown and tell you to change into it while they leave the room. You get naked (you can leave socks on! Often the exam rooms and tables are cold so I like to wear knee socks to these things) and put on the sheet/paper gown/what have you. For a full spectrum test, they will have to draw some blood--they may send you to a lab to do it after your pelvic exam. For just the basic doctor's pelvic exam, the doctor comes in, you get up on the table, and she sits down in front of you and asks you to scooch up so that your knees are bend and she can easily see what's going on. Then she puts KY jelly on her glove, and first inserts about two fingers and does a brief manual exam, with her other hand pressing down on your stomach. I usually find this the most comfortable part of the exam. (Unless the doctor is rough with their fingers, and you can tell them off about it. Most are very, very gentle.)  Then she inserts the speculum. That may feel a little cold. Also, if it's your first time, tell the doc that and request the smallest size speculum they have (although since you're sexually active, it shouldn't really matter--it matters more if you're still a virgin). She dilates it and looks at your cervix, then swabs a q-tip in there. There's a very brief weird "oi?" sensation (no pain--just weird), and then you're done. It usually only takes a couple of minutes--the speculum part takes hardly any time at all. If you're going to an STD clinic, they'll be able to do a blood test right there, and they may skip the manual part of the pelvic exam.  (I noticed I've been saying "she" in referring to the doctor because all my Ob-Gyns have been female, but obviously it can be a male doctor as well.)  My main advice would be to *relax* as much as possible during your pap. Do breathing exercises. If you're relaxed down there, it's no big deal at all (the speculum is much smaller than a penis, and they use a lot of lube). If you are tense and clench down, that's when it can be very uncomfortable/painful.  Oh, and since they DO use a lot of lube, I'd recommend bringing (or asking for) wet wipes. They give you napkins, but wet wipes are better.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm nearly 23, never had kids, got the Mirena almost two years ago. Best. decision. ever.   I love my Mirena, it doesn't give me any nasty side effects, it's safer than the pill and I don't ever have to think about it. Obviously, my positive experience is no guarantee that it will work the same for you. But from what I understand, the side effects with the Mirena are much milder than with other methods of BC and you're less likely to develop those side effects. I, personally, couldn't be more happy with my Mirena.
TwoXChromosomes X I was so paranoid about contracting an std that I got tested before I even had sex for the first time.  And since then I insist that anyone I sleep with gets tested (only exception was a one night stand and then I vigorously got checked every 3 months for a year even if I wasn't having sex)  There is nothing wrong with requesting a partner to get tested.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Almost all ~~sexually active~~ adults have HPV.  FTFY.  What most people don't know is that HPV is actually a term for an entire class of viruses. ANY wart is a strain of HPV. Upwards of 90% of the population is infected with multiple strains of HPV, and upwards of 80% of those infected are infected with at least one of the known carcinogenic strains. We get these viruses from people around us as babies. The vast majority of the time no symptoms ever present (ie: warts). There are a handful of carcinogenic strains, though it is VERY RARE and very difficult for them to cause cancer, which is why "HPV tests" usually only test for the small number that are known to be extra carcinogenic, and even the people who have these are unlikely to actually develop cancer. The HPV vaccine also only protects against a small handful of these viruses, because most of them are totally harmless.  HPV is class of human viruses that stay with us for life (like herpes, which is also an entire class, including viruses like chicken pox) and have evolved along with us and are adapted to us as hosts. Extremely contagious, and not very dangerous. Everybody has HPV, everybody has herpes, yada yada. Most people don't present symptoms, and most people don't get cancer.  (Source: Microbiology is one of my departments, although I am only an undergrad)  So yep, HPV isn't really a big thing to worry about. I'd be more worried about the fact that 1 in 14 Americans is diagnosed with lung cancer within their lifetime.
TwoXChromosomes X Sweetheart, if you don't want to, **then don't**. You will regret it, and resent him.   It hurts to think that you have to choose between him and this pregnancy, but you don't - it sounds as if it is already over. Having the baby = he doesn't want to be around. Not having the baby = you are living with the fact that you went against your own heart for him.  What if he changes his mind, and decides that you two could have done it after all? Where the hell does that leave you?  Your best chance of making the most of this is being true to yourself. I 100% promise you that whatever you choose will be the best choice if you do that.
BabyBumps X It depends on the position of your baby and the confidence of the ultrasound technician.  They told us boy at 13 weeks; the baby was very generous with opportunities to see clearly but even then, the technician told us not to buy anything because there was a lot of uncertainty that early.  The baby later confirmed to be a boy.
TwoXChromosomes X "I'm unprepared to be a mother, but I could suck up and do the right thing."  In my opinion, the right thing wouldn't be sucking it up and dealing with a baby.  It doesn't sound like he wants it, it doesn't sound like you're ready.   "This baby lived through what should have killed it. I cannot in good conscience kill my child."  This seems arbitrary to me.    **Ultimately, is this baby going to have the best life you could/want to give your child?**  You have the rest of your life, it seems like you have pretty a good one just getting started, and I think the wiser decision would be to wait and have a child under better circumstances.  It IS your right to choose; however, your decision will affect other people's lives as well.
BabyBumps X I have checked for blood every day since I got pregnant (first hoping I wasn't pregnant, then thinking I might miscarry, and now just waiting on labor to get here), don't get me wrong I am exited about the baby, it sounds bad thinking I might miscarry but it was a legit fear and I could not be more exited that I have a healthy happy baby girl inside of me. 
AskWomen X I think the biggest no brainer fix for this is lots of forplay. But for quickies it's got to be intense or I'm going just to space out! 
BabyBumps X I'll be refusing bathing to get the benefit of the vernix ( ) and delaying cord clamping. ( )
TwoXChromosomes X When I found out that I was pregnant with my daughter, neither her father or I were anywhere near ready to even consider being parents. I had family members telling me that i needed to consider my options. That I should abort or offer her up for adoption. It was an incredibly stressful situation to be in but I ultimately decided to keep her and it was the best decision of my life. If keeping your child is something that you want to do then DO IT. It will NOT be easy. But it can be done. I worked part time waiting tables, was in school, and raised her. Now i work full time, am still in school, and am still raising her. IT is hard, and expensive, but it is worth every penny, and every ounce of energy exerted, and every second of sleep lost, etc.   I later got pregnant again and was def. not ok with the idea of a second child so close to my first with a man that was obviously on his way out of my life. This time i had even more pressure from family to abort this child. The stress from it all was enough to cause me to miscarry. I still think about it and it was almost 3 years ago.   If you take nothing else out of my rant, please take this: This is your decision to make, no one else can tell you what to do here. Be Prepared, it will be hard. Do your research on all options available to you. The government has some good programs available for assistance. I.E. WIC and Medicaid  If you decide that an abortion is the best option for you, which it sounds like you're against, but still, if you decide to go that route, do not let anyone make you feel like less of a person. The people that are so vehemently against it have never been put in a position in which they have had to legitimately consider it.  I have had a child, had a miscarriage, and had an abortion. If you need someone to talk to, PLEASE...PM me. I will be more than happy to talk to you about my experiences.  EDIT: Something I just thought about, if you are considering adoption, my mother is adopted and if you have any questions in regards to how being adopted effects the child, I can ask her.
BabyBumps X I was surprised how baby-like it actually looked at 12 weeks, it was awesome! Im actually bursting with excitement about my scan next week!!!
BabyBumps X The nausea coming and going is TOTALLY normal. It can just as easily just reappear.   I'm gonna go with calm the freak down ;)  Unless your cramping is severe... like if you didn't know you were pregnant you would *still* be worried about it severe, it's not likely a problem. 
BabyBumps X I came here to also suggest watching the Business of Being Born with him... as fireash said, you gotta take the info with a grain of salt, but it was that documentary that helped my SO understand why I wanted a more natural birth.  I think sometimes boys forget that a woman's body is made for birthing, and that in a lot of cases, we don't need all that extra hooey.  
beyondthebump X Yay! So glad for you and I hope things continue to get better from here. Could be that he's not still hungry but just looking to comfort nurse, ie suckling but not actually drinking. My newborn nursed for about 40-45 minutes per side but most of it was just comfort nursing. Plus the longer you let him stay on your boob the more your supply will be stimulated. If he's still hungry he should be able to get another letdown just by keeping at it.   Sore nips, I think lanolin after every feed is important, I didn't do it at first and I had a lot of cracks and pain. But like everyone else has said, it gets better within a few weeks. 
BabyBumps X I was terribly crampy, and had a lot of stabbing pains in my lower back. So far, so good... I wouldn't worry about it if I were you, especially if it's not accompanied by bleeding.
Parenting X chap stick!!! I had some in my purse but my husband couldn't find it. :(  toiletries / lotion that you like  tennis balls / back massager  baby outfit in newborn &amp; size 3M (some kids never fit in the newborn size)  USB charger for phones (most are standard these days, and fairly cheap)  lose sweat pants  tie-front / zip-front robe  A sleep nursing bra (or any nursing bra that is comfy and not size specific)  My hospital had snacks available for free, so that wasn't necessary for us. Shouldn't need diapers either - raid the hospital. Same with Maxi pads. 
BabyBumps X Wait, your doc is shaming you for gaining "too much weight" while pregnant, and the recommended amount to gain at your size is 25-35 pounds for the whole pregnancy according to ACOG?! And if the average gain is 1 lb a week for the 3rd trimester, I'd say you're right on track. One pound per week at this point will put you at 30 pounds of gain at 40 weeks. What's wrong with your doctor? 
BabyBumps X Your doctor sounds like an idiot. I am close to your measurements (5'2, 130 lbs) and I gained 20 lbs by second trimester. I was quite concerned but my doctor wasn't worried at all as the baby's growth was on track. I didn't end up gaining a pound in the third - again baby was still growing so my OB wasn't worried.  Since I went right back to preconception weight within two weeks I'm convinced that I didn't really gain any fat. The placenta and fluid and everything else weighs a ton and your doctor should know that. Maybe the overreaction is due to the fact that 20 lbs looks like 40 on a small woman! Hugs. I think you're doing it right. 
BabyBumps X I elected to do an induction with my last pregnancy.  There was no medical reason, however...my care had been technical transferred from midwives to an ob due to my low platelets, but the ob I was transferred to was very pro midwife and had no problem with letting my midwives deliver.  If I had waited to go into labour naturally I could have landed on a day where there was an ob on rotation in the hospital that didn't feel that way and I wouldn't get my midwives :(  So I picked a day to induced when my OB was on call, so he would let my midwives do their thing :)  So yes, I was very happy for it.
BabyBumps X I think a lot of doctors see people just go nuts when they get pregnant and not worry about the quality or quantity of what they are eating, so they get a little jumpy when they see a big gain in a month. Did you discuss it with your doctor and say what you were eating or anything?   My doctor wanted me to gain 20, I've gained 30 overall but have hardly gained anything from week 35 on and have actually lost a couple of pounds because eating is just a chore now. It sounds like you've gained a totally reasonable amount. 
BabyBumps X We are still having the debate. It's not that common for boys to be circumcised here. My SO is one of the few circumcised penises I've seen (and I've seen a lot of penises).   I think we should leave the wee fellas weefella as it is, the SO wants to cut. 
BabyBumps X We did tell everyone when we went to the hospital in labor. I had a c section so only my husband was allowed in. When we told everyone that we were at the hospital it was followed with "we will tell you when we are ready for visitors but if you choose to come now you will have to stay in the family waiting room till we are ready". It worked pretty well for us because no one showed up at the hospital till we called again to say we were ready for visitors. I was the same as you. I didn't want it to be complete chaos with people everywhere.
BabyBumps X She's not even suggesting giving birth at home or at a birth center.  It'd be nice if the doctor's #1 priority was the same as yours.  Yes, he wants the mother and baby alive, but he wants it out ASAP so he/she can deliver the next one, go home for dinner with the family, go golfing etc.  Most babies are born on Fridays.  Those are usually scheduled.  Hospitals will actually turn you away if you are not dilated enough.  If you are taking too long they will talk you into pitocin.  Pitocin makes your contractions uneven and stronger.  That usually leads to an epidural for the pain.  Epidurals (may or may not work) can slow or stop contractions (leading to more pitocin) and make it harder to push since you can no longer feel your bottom half.  The longer the labor takes (and compounding drugs) the more likely the baby will be affected and become distressed.  C-section time.  While a lot of c-sections go smoothly, it is major abdominal surgery.  It carries all the risk with it.  Low risk women should be able to give birth vaginally, without pain meds, and on their own time.  She will be at a hospital in case anything goes wrong, but she should not feel pressured into doing something that would possible endanger her and her child.  Babies and mothers may die at home births, but they die in hospitals too.  Maybe her preferences coincide with your priority.  Waiting a while in the comfort of her house and having someone to be clear headed on her side is not a bad thing.  Doulas can be over ruled if the mother and child are endanger.  Luckily my SO trusted my judgement and understood my reasons.  I may end up needing the interventions.  We live 5 minutes from a hospital.  If things start going bad, they'll call ahead so the doctors would be waiting for us when we got there.
BabyBumps X To me, your weight gain seems spot on... granted, I am not a doctor, but I really don't understand OB's who shame women for gaining weight.  Also, it kind of seems like your body is going to do what it's going to do...as in, you will gain what you need to gain to support the pregnancy.   I essentially gained a pound a week until week 32 and have since stopped gaining weight.  My starting weight was 115, I am at 147 now, and have been for the last 4 weeks.  My midwives have not mentioned my weight once, and are just happy that the baby is measuring where he should be.
BabyBumps X Ask him to read Husband Coached Childbirth. It's written by an OB who advocates for natural childbirth with the husband's support. My husband and I are taking a Bradley Class based on the book, and it's awesome. But the book itself has really good information in it. 
BabyBumps X I totally understand electing a cs instead of a vaginal birth in your situation. Having the option to deliver vbac is great, but I know there are lots of risks to you and baby... like you said, it would suck trying to delivery vaginally and then wind up with an emergency cs anyway. 
BabyBumps X My first is cirumcised and only because that was the norm for us.  Before my second was conceived and while I was pregnant, I did the research and decided against it. It is primarily a cosmetic procedure, the AAP doesn't recommend having it done like they once did. My husband is circumcised and would have been fine if this boy had been too. It is all he knows though. However, he knew that I knew more on the subject than he did even if he had a penis so my youngest son is intact. My midwife also has a mix like we did- some circed and some intact (she has 3 sons I believe and I cannot recall the ratio). My pediatrician also said there was no medical necessity for it and was totally for us leaving him intact.  I don't have to do anything special with it- just clean it like I would a finger. No retraction as it'll happen as my son gets older by his own doing.
BabyBumps X If your positive tests were negative at first and then changed after the time limit it's still negative.  Those would be evaporation lines making it "positive". That is why they have the time limit.  If it was negative at first and then became positive within about 5ish minutes, then that positive could be more reliable.  When you went to the clinic did they do blood test or another urine test?  For some people urine tests just don't work.  My ex-girlfriend was one of those people, same with her mother.  They had to have blood tests done to confirm.  If you are 30 days late there could be other reasons, but if you really think you are pregnant ask for a blood test.
TwoXChromosomes X Is there any way to reason with him via statistics? Or maybe look into a menstrual cup? They don't have the risk of TSS and many women find they're "cleaner". 
AskWomen X I am and always will be pro-choice. I don't think it's the government's place to regulate abortion in any circumstance. It should be a choice made between a woman and her doctor.  That said, I also think abortion is incredibly sad. I don't have any figures to back this up, but I think most late-term abortions are performed because of a serious birth defect (ie - being born without a brain) or because the pregnancy poses a life-threatening risk to the mother. Even if those aren't the case and the mother just doesn't want to have a baby, it's still a decision between her and her doctor and *not* the government.
TwoXChromosomes X Do not mess with anything that can worsen migraines, not worth it in the long run. You probably won't find a doctor that will give you the IUD. 
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds like the hormones maybe be messing with your emotions, but that you also kind of need hormonal birth control for your periods.  If I were you I'd check out NuvaRing and Mirena (the IUD).  They require less hormones to do the same thing, since they're already in the area that needs them :).  I'm going to get Mirena in a couple of months, and I could not be more excited for it.  Some women have even said their period *goes away* on it.
TwoXChromosomes X TSS has to do with how long it takes bacteria to grow enough to cause the dangerous over-the-top immune reaction.  Now, as far as how often you should change a tampon, it does depend on flow, and also on how absorbent the tampon is.  The only reason she would have to change her tampon every couple of hours is if it's filling up every couple of hours, but since you can get higher absorbancies, she may only need to change a super or super plus tampon every 8 hours.  And while 8 hours is the maximum time recommended to leave a tampon in, it's still well within safe boundaries.  Just like with everything else in the medical world, they like to leave room for error.  So changing a tampon every 8 hours is not dangerous with a heavy flow; in fact it's pretty much normal.  And as someone who doesn't like pads and had a very heavy flow before getting on birth control, I can tell you that there is a difference in how I feel with pads and tampons, because I do get the gross drippy feeling.  It also doesn't go away when I change the pad, because it's all up in my vulva and all kinds of disgusting.  I can also tell you that the thin slip size pads weren't able to contain my flow, and the one time I had to use pads in high school, I had to change between every class because they were the thin ones and even though they were supposed to be for moderately heavy periods, I was bleeding through them like crazy.  But the super-plus tampons worked for me, usually lasting about 6-7 hours when my flow was heaviest.  So you clearly don't know what you're talking about, probably because you've never really used tampons since they hurt you.  Which is fine, but don't act like you know what you're talking about because you found a website that says someone with a heavy flow using tampons "will **probably** need to change every 2-3 hours." (*emphasis mine*)
BabyBumps X My ball is the ONLY thing standing between me and horrible back/hip pain most nights.... If I could sleep on that thing, I would.
AskWomen X Yes it is, no need to worry. As long as you don't forget a pill when you're supposed to be taking one, you're fine. (Forever. I've been on the pill for 8 years.)
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds like it's time to start exploring your other options. What happened to make the pill unreliable for you?  It sounds like pregnancy is so threatening to you that you really don't want to risk it. How about a combination of methods, like an iud plus fertility awareness, or condoms and withdrawal?
BabyBumps X Wait till you get to this point. My baby is putting alien to shame! Shes been at it for a good 2 hours now, started with hiccups, and now shes got her feet on my ribs and shes stretching out, which is putting a lot of pressure on my ladyparts. You can see her knees jabbing out of my stomach and I can feel her hands wiggling around near my bikini line, and I'm getting an occassional punch to my cervix (which sucks because if my bladder is full I have to instapee). She is wearing me out! I asked her to stop and she just went nuts, however she has herself positioned shes having a blast, I on the other hand am worn out!
BabyBumps X Nothing, really. I'm just letting myself be a little less cautious about over-exertion when it comes to errands/doing things around the house. Maybe getting a little more lovin' than usual, a couple more squats, but baby is going to come when baby wants to come. I'm just trying to stay all well-rested, well-hydrated and well-fed in the final weeks so I'll have lots of energy for labor and delivery.
BabyBumps X If you are GBS positive, insist on NOT having your water broken. Let it break on its own.  They can probably do cervidil the day before your scheduled induction and some that is enough to throw them into labor anyway.  But hey... good luck and he'res to hoping all this is over nothing and you go into labor on your own well before then :)
TwoXChromosomes X I actually have hypothyroidism and am being actively treated for it with Synthroid.   I brought that up with my doctor when I saw her last fall and she sent me for blood testing. After I went on Synthroid I definitely felt a LOT better overall, but my sex drive didn't pick up much.   I might ask her to send me for another blood test just to check to see if my dosage needs to be adjusted, but I'm not feeling the overall fatigue that I associate with my thyroid being out of whack. So confusing. :( 
TwoXChromosomes X I know that the IUD has gotten pretty advanced and more safe in the past few years so might want to think about when your friends had theirs inserted-that might change things. I am not sure. I know that the ladies I know who have one have had no problems.  Anyway, I had NO sex drive while on the pill. I was on the pill for 10 years. About 1.5 years ago I got the IUD (I was 28 and never had kids) and I am telling you it is a godsend. I got the no-hormone copper one. My sex drive is back with a vengeance. It has made me feel like a new woman!  The downside is that I was crampy for a couple weeks right after...comparable to period cramps. Also, my period was not back to regular for at least 6 to 8 months. But I stuck with it and I have NO regrets. I am extremely happy with the decision to get an IUD.  Good luck!
beyondthebump X I am also nursing. We have tried that and she still just screams at him. We have also tried having me or my mom start her bottle then hand her to him without the bottle ever leaving her mouth. The minute she is with him though she stops eating and starts fussing.
AskWomen X I do agree, and I realize it is a radical idea. Here is my explanation:  Basically to me, if you are considering a viable fetus outside the womb to be a human with rights, which is the road I was going down with the idea, then the issue becomes a toss-up between protecting the rights of the mother's person while also protecting the rights of the child's person, when the mother refuses to continue to carry the child.   The only other options would be to simply perform the abortion, which in this context would be considered manslaughter or murder if the fetus is viable (again, this is using the assumption that you would draw the line of "alive/citizen with a right to life" at viability outside the womb), or to force the woman to attempt to carry the child to term by making late-term abortions illegal, which you could also argue is invasive due to the baby's continued impact on her body(even if not life-threatening) and an unwanted procedure as she would have to deliver it eventually. Further, a C-section may become necessary during a routine delivery anyway, so the invasive procedure would still be a possibility if it were not legal.   Optimally the decision would be made earlier in the pregnancy, and I do think that you could still argue that life in terms of citizenship and rights begins at the point of birth, which would make it a moot point and abortions performed up to birth would remain legitimately legal. Because of all of the gray area, this is probably still the best choice.  But there is to me more of an ethical dilemma here than with a typical earlier abortion where it could not survive outside of the womb if removed from the mother's body. 
BabyBumps X Mine has been destroying my insides for the last few months! I've heard they get less active at the end, but mine is insane. Except of course last night when I was getting a NST lol. It beats me all day, then it stops at the hospital.  They were concerned and kept me there for an ultrasound. It likes to jam its head into my cervix, arms straight out sideways, feet in ribs, and shove as hard as possible:) 
BabyBumps X LOL! omg.. i never really thought about it like that, however... now that you mention it, this will never go away.   I lol'd. a lot. I can't wait! Im sooo excited!!!!! 32 WEEKS AND COUNTING!!!
BabyBumps X I had to reassure my mom *again* despite previously doing a home birth that we are *not* being wreckless.  Her concern was postpartum hemorrhage... I had to explain that I'm at lower risk because we let the placenta birth on its own instead of forcing it out... But that if it happened, my midwife has the same medication with her that they use in the hospital, and if transfer is necessary, we won't even wait for an ambulance, she will call the hospital and let them know to prep the ER... And we can get there in just a few minutes in her vehicle.  And that's if anything even goes wrong.
BabyBumps X There is a lot more blood in the pelvic region during pregnancy and could be swelling and tenderness.  Also, you could be carrying a little low and so you have extra pressure?  Just a guess that those could be factors.
BabyBumps X Same as male circumcision. Its not your genitalia, dont mutilate it without unless its a medical necessity 
AskWomen X Totally right!  My Gyno fully encourages women to get IUDs if they want them.  She had no problem with me wanting one despite never having children.  I have the Paragard (copper, no hormones) and I'm glad I have it.  Only downside for me has been heavier periods, but the benefits (no hormones, no pills, lasts 10 years) are totally worth it.
BabyBumps X It's in the Mayo clinic guide to a healthy pregnancy which is a great book. Its like a science book for preggos except theres no homework. So much information!!
BabyBumps X I had one done at 30 weeks and we still couldn't tell if the baby looks more like me or my husband. I can definitely tell my LO apart from other 3d scans: I've stared at it long enough ;-)  Oh and keep in mind that you may or may not get a clear view of your baby ( ours had all the cord in front of him/her, knees/feet all drawn up in front of him/her and one hand covering the face ).  We were also told it might be a boy ( our anatomy scan at 19 wks:girl ), but we're not 100% convinced: what we saw as testicles onscreen might have been umbilical cord as well. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is way too broad a statement. If she lacked the necessary information to give the greatest chance of a successful pregnancy his statement is fine. She should have seen an obstetrician after the positive pregnancy test.
TwoXChromosomes X I often have nausea as a symptom with my period, and I've heard many of my post-partum friends complain of similar symptoms. I suspect your hormone balance may have changed after having your baby. It might be worth getting tested by your doctor so they can help to even you out a bit.
AskWomen X ^ Best answer, dorei22.  I would only add that she would probably be taking pregnancy tests by the end of 1st week. (First week being June 3rd-10th, when her period was supposed to be happening.)   Also, pregnancy tests can successfully detect pregnancy as early as 1-2 days before the period starts (June 1st or 2nd), if you want an extra detail.
BabyBumps X do ur research before dumping.  I asked my friends and they all had universally the same experience with their OBs which made me think that OBs are generally short when it comes to pre-natal visits (especially in a healthy pregnancy).   This is one of the major reasons I switched to a midwife based care (in the US) but ofcourse I went and met all the midwives and decided on one I liked before switching. I don't want to switch again if I can help it. 
BabyBumps X Congrats! When I found out I didn't believe it. I had to wait a month before going in and it wasn't hard cause I couldn't even get it through my head lol. In fact they told me yesterday I'll have baby by next Wednesday and I still feel surreal. I guess once I hold him/her it'll sink in :) 
TwoXChromosomes X Most doctors want you to have an annual exam before prescribing birth control. The annual exam is to check for things like cervical and breast cancer, it's not something that any woman really likes but it's important. Her job is to "check out the goods" what would you do in a few appointments with her, just talk about your goods? 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't recommend trusting the pull out method as a sole source of birth control (due to the large gap between perfect use and typical use).  However, using it as a back up method to another form of birth control is something I highly recommend.  My partner has incredible control so we have no problem and use it to make sure my Nuvaring is fully affective.  Adding the pull out method to birth control takes the yearly failure rate from 1% to 0.0044%.
TwoXChromosomes X Really? This was an NHS nurse that told me 7 days, and I also looked it up on multiple sites... the wording of the instructions of the pills is what confuses me. It says "It is usual to start the pill on the first day of your period, so that you will be protected IMMEDIATELY" and also "If you miss more than one pill you are no longer protected, so wear a condom for the next 7 days"
TwoXChromosomes X It doesn't seem all *that* irregular to me. The last two times, you've had 5-6 day periods, and your cycles have been 30 days and 23 days. You're also still young, and your periods should get more regular as you get older.  I really don't think there are any "natural" solutions for hormonal irregularity in the sense of like, eating a bunch of herbs or exercising more or something. The only way you can *really* fix that is to start taking hormones, I.E birth control.  If it really is troubling you to have slightly irregular periods, you can start taking the pill/other hormonal birth control. However, you seem unwilling to take the pill, and your periods don't seem so irregular to me as to he intolerable.  TL;DR **DEAL WITH IT**
BabyBumps X There are a zillion birthdays around Eve's due date so I hear comments often about how she should be born on such and such date. I have no control over when she comes. Heck, she might as well come on MY birthday which is 6 days after her due date. I'd even take a labor day baby to avoid everyone else's birthdays.
TwoXChromosomes X She informed him she was keeping it after previously having said she was aborting it.  He didn't use condoms because she was on birth control.   Also, they met "a little over two months ago", found out she was 5-6 weeks pregnant about 3 weeks ago. meaning she is 8-9 weeks pregnant and they met 8-9 weeks ago, meaning she was either pregnant before she met him or she got pregnant VERY quickly (which is all totally fine!) But that means the guy was finding out she was pregnant after knowing her for about a month. I wouldn't want to have a kid with someone I had known for a month!
BabyBumps X symptoms come and go as they please.  Some days you'll feel like death, other days you'll feel fine.  Some spotting is supposed to be normal and what you saw was brownish-pink so it's a bit less worrisome.  If it had been bright red and accompanied by cramping then there would be a more urgent worry.  Brown is old blood though and they tend to worry less about it.  Still a good idea to let your doctor know and ultimately your doc will do a better job at letting you know that you are fine then we will.  At the moment though it was just a really small amount, you haven't mentioned any cramping and it hasn't happened since so I would go with try not to worry and it's most likely nothing.  And when they say normal they mean that some women do actually spot a bit in the first few weeks of pregnancy and nothing is wrong.  It's just what their body does.  
TwoXChromosomes X I was on birth control for 5 years. I never missed a pill. I was never late for a period.    As long as you take your pill **EVERY SINGLE DAY** at the **SAME TIME** you will be fine.   Also, make sure you know whether or not other medicine, like antibiotics, effects your pill use. Sometimes you will have to use a secondary method.
TwoXChromosomes X While you're waiting to see a doctor, I'd also recommend getting Cystex or AZO (Cystex won't discolor your urine, if you can find it). Drink a ton of water and real cranberry juice--the bitter, 100% juice kind, not the sugary cocktail kind. Cranberry capsules would help, too, but might be pricier. Get to a doctor as soon as you possibly can. If I were you, I'd just go to the clinic immediately and get it over with. The only solution is antibiotics, and there's no sense in waiting!  The back pain could definitely be related. Is it your lower back/sides? Call the chiropractor to check in, and maybe reschedule. If there's blood in your urine, it could be quite serious, and the back pain *may* be kidney inflammation.   Source: I get like eight goddamn UTI's a year. 
TwoXChromosomes X The pain is referred to as flank pain, and it is a sign that the infection is moving to or already in your kidney. Or it could be a kidney stone, some of which cause UTIs. Try laying on your right side, if that pressure alleviates the pain a bit, it is the UTI.   Please be careful, waiting overnight almost cost me a kidney. I now pop cranberry pills three times a day and they are so worth it.
TwoXChromosomes X Can't stress it enough-- ALWAYS get up and pee after having sex! Otherwise you will end up with urinary tract infections and those are not fun for anyone!!
TwoXChromosomes X If you want to keep getting your period, I'd wait to put in your first one until around July 6 (whatever day of the week/weekend you want to put it in on). Keep it in for four weeks (many places still say three, but it's safe for four, as directed by two of my gynos and my personal experience--you don't need to be on a four week cycle just because the moon goes that way, five weeks is great and saves you money), take it out, and a week after that, after you have your period, put the next one in. You'll then be in the middle of the cycle and nowhere near your period on the big day.  If you want to just skip, you could put it in now, wear it for four weeks, have *that* period, and then put in the new one, and then skip straight to the third one. Skipping is usually fine, but sometimes you'll spot, so to be absolutely sure without having tested how your body reacts to skipping, I'd recommend sticking the Ring in the fridge for two weeks, and starting it then, so you'll just hit your wedding in the middle of the cycle to be safe. :)
BabyBumps X Laying on your belly feels incredible after not being able to do so for so long. My solution to that was to get one of those floaters with a headrest and mesh middle bit, and lay belly down on it in a pool. It was amazing, especially after several restless nights. I nearly felt normal again, just for a little while.  Appreciate your body, it is doing some miraculous shit now.
beyondthebump X The last few days I've been trying to go to Bumps but having just done ten months of pregnancy and labor and delivery reading about pregnancy is a little overwhelming for me. It's strange to say. I still love all the preggies I see and I want to continue to read Bumps posts once I'm caught up with my new life :)
BabyBumps X It seems that some dr's are a bit obsessive over the weight gain stuff.  I specifically told mine I was a b it worried that I was going to put on too much.  She said that it fluctuates, but that she will look at the weight gain overall at the end (for me between 25 &amp; 35 lbs).  They get concerned if you put on too much weight too fast because a lot of the calories go straight to baby as fat, and can lead to problems after birth.  
BabyBumps X It's typical for the nipple/areola to get darker. Beyond that would be unusual, but not necessarily something to worry about. Your body could just be reacting in a safe but unusual way. Definitely mention it at your next appointment, but I don't think it's something to freak out about.
TwoXChromosomes X I got some reusable cloth pads from partyinmypants (no joke). I prefer pads since they can be changed more easily in a public space than a cup, and they've been a godsend. :) I think they have a free pad (just pay shipping) to anyone new. 
BabyBumps X This around the time you get braxton hicks so it's normal.  Really you only worry if you have 4-6 in an hour and if they don't get better with you resting on your left side, drinking fluids. You should let your doctor know though, I did at least.  It makes me feel better to hear from her that there is nothing to worry about. 
TwoXChromosomes X Go you! I got my Paragard (copper IUD) I think... last year or ... sometime. I'm really bad with time. Anyway, I'm 24, so I was either younger than you or your age when I got mine, whenever it was! Nulliparous here, too. My experience was pretty similar, except my cervix is way the fuck up there and it was kind of hard for her to get to it.   Like you, the pain was kind of ouchy but not oh-my-god-I'm-going-to-punch-someone-in-the-face-and-shoot-myself-afterwards painful. I gritted my teeth and held my girlfriend's hand tighter and that was that. Anyway, it was over pretty quick, and I was able to walk afterwards, though I did get a ride home (like 50min away).  I spotted for a while and did have some pain/discomfort for a few days, but I've never really had bad cramps often so my pain/discomfort is probably everyone else's "light cramps". It was probably a week or two before I could have activities again.   For reference, my girl also has the Paragard, but she got hers after the birth of her son and she has always had a history of rough periods. I think she was 19 or so. Her insertion was super painful and her periods got more ouchy/heavy afterwards. She still prefers it because all the hormonal methods make her seriously ill or psychotic. It's for the best.  (Before you ask: Poly triad, we share a partner - my boyfriend, her husband. I'm *super* anti-baby, she just can't use any other reliable contraceptives.)  Anyways, no babies and no hormones = happy girl. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I am currently on 2.5 years of my implanon. Here is my brief history thus far:  First 3 months I was irregular and heavier than usual  3 months - 1.5 year I was so light and I was bleeding 2-3 days max, some months was only one day  1.5 - 2 years I started getting heavier again, but because I was so light for over a year, I didn't really see a problem and I was actually pretty normal.  Then the past couple of months I have been light but spotty for longer periods of time. I will get it, finish in 5 days, have sexy time and then start again the next day. Completely frustrating.  Pros: no weight gain, seems to help with acne, no babies and I don't have to worry about forgetting the pill....I forget it's in my arm 95% of the time  Cons: inconsistency in periods, low labido   Overall opinion: my mom originally purchased the implanon for my younger sister but she refused to take it, so I only had to pay the co-pay for the surgery. The surgery by the way took less than 5 minutes and only a local anesthesia was needed on my left arm. It has saved me money on birth control since it was a one time cost, however I'm not sure if I am going to get it again in January when I am scheduled to have it removed. I will do some research on other options, but the side effects are relatively minimal compared to my friends on other forms of bc.   Hope you have the best of luck. Remember, give it a few months and if you still don't like it, you can always have it removed sooner than the 3 years.
TwoXChromosomes X I got mine from amazon. The diva cup website can help you find retail spots in your area, but amazon was cheaper for me.   There's a bit of a learning curve, but after a couple months, they're not difficult to use.   Praise: there's no risk of TSS, so you can put it in even when you're  not bleeding  yet. I had to stand up in a wedding yesterday, around the day my period was supposed to start, so I put the cup in in the morning. When I got home, I discovered I had started at some point during the day and just had no idea. It was perfect. 
TwoXChromosomes X Just to clarify - are you on your third pack of 28 day pills or on your third week of the pack? If it's the former, have you had three withdrawal periods after every pack? If so, sometimes your hormones can be not as strong as you'd hoped and the pill isn't enough to cover you. You may need to change your pill (and up the dose of oestrogen) if this continues.  If you have run the packs together without having a break, then sometimes spotting (light or heavy) can occur at the end of the three or four packs, which then I would suggest to have a withdrawal period and then just continue as normal.  If you're on your third week of the one pack your body may just not have gotten used to the hormones yet because you started a week and a half into your cycle, so you may need another month or so to get used to it. Best thing to do is to start taking the pill for the first time on the first day of your period.  The most important thing is to do just like you're doing: take the pill regularly every day around the same time and either take a break for 7 days or run the packs together, avoiding the placebo pills. Unless your doctor has instructed you otherwise.
Parenting X Sounds like he needs more at his feedings during the night &amp; I would feed him when he is hungry, not plan on his feedings for the night.. My little one went through a phase of wanting a bottle every two hours during the night. I gave more formula and that helped tremendously. 
BabyBumps X Firstly, I did your pinch of salt with a glass of water trick this morning before breakfast. You must have a stomach of iron. It was all I could do to not gag, but I did it. So hopefully this helps. How often am I supposed to do this to treat the dizziness? Once a day?  Also, when I say I'm deficient in everything, I came back deficient in all vitamins except for Vitamin K. I'm taking my prenatal with an extra boost of iron in it, and I'm showing up anemic still, as well as deficient in just about everything. My doctor changed my prenatal (again) and told me to make sure I was taking it with food, which I already was doing. She's stripping me of everything lol.
BabyBumps X The first time I gave birth I didn't really have much of a bloody show. It was just like...snot coming out of my vagina...gross.   Really, when you think about it, a lot of things about pregnancy and birth are just so disgusting ha ha.   My water didn't break either and the doctor had to manually break it at the hospital. Perhaps I have a weird vagina. 
BabyBumps X Very exciting!! Our little girl seems to like to kick/punch at my hubby's arm when he lays it across my belly at bedtime. She has definitely started packing a pretty good punch. It's amazing how much stronger they get. They startle me sometimes! 
BabyBumps X my mom with her 2nd born had a pink bloody show, went to hospital and had a 3 hour natural labor.  it was her only child out of 4 that wasn't induced, and she said it was relatively painless and quick.    
TwoXChromosomes X There is always the chance that they will fail but if you take them correctly, the odds are in your favor.  Birth control pills don't work only on the days that you take them.  On a very basic level, they fool your body into thinking that you're already pregnant so that you do not ovulate.  So as long as you are taking them correctly (the same time every single day) through the rest of the month, your chances of pregnancy are low.  If you're worried about pregnancy, doubling up and using the Pill and condoms at the same time is a good idea.  If you have questions about how your specific birth control works, I'd recommend asking your doctor.  He or she can probably help you more than the internet can.  
BabyBumps X I've had a similar issue. I only lost 5 pounds in my 1st trimester but I'm a smaller girl, so when the weight gain did hit most of it started upwards making that roll then progressed to my bump. So now when I sit or lay down I've got a small roll between my boobs and my bump. Between my second trimester and now, I've gained 17 pounds and most of it shows in that area.
BabyBumps X We were going to wait until 12 weeks but we actually told them at just before 10, it was getting harder and harder not to and I figured I'd want their support if the worst does happen! 
BabyBumps X My miscarriage story is still being written, but I am very confident it will turn out great. I had a daughter when I was 17 by molestation/rape. After a few years I found out that it wasn't my fault (still have issues with it). A few years later I got pregnant with my then bf's baby. I was really nervous but after talking about it, decided I was happy. A couple weeks later, I had a miscarriage. After the mc, I was informed I had PID and severe scaring on my Fallopian tubes. I was also told that it was likely I would never have kids again. That was in 2006. Fast forward a few years to February of this year. Went to the ER thinking I had dislocated my shoulder. They made me pee in a cup because I had to get x-rays. They came back in later with the iron curtain (which if anyone has ever had x-rays while pregnant they know what I'm talking about). I was shocked, I was never supposed to have a baby again. We decided to keep it a secret til I knew I was out of the danger zone (12+ weeks). Found out a couple weeks later that instead of being 10 weeks pregnant (like I was supposed to be according to my last period) I was actually 16. We started telling everyone. I'm now almost 31 weeks with little to no complications. If I was to have the baby today, there's a really good chance it would survive. So tell your wife to keep her head up!! /Hugs &lt;3  TLDR: Miscarried, wasn't supposed to have kids again, now 31 weeks pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X My understanding is that TP tampons are for a situation where you go to the bathroom, and desperately need a change, but there are no tampons available. You just make one, run and find a real tampon, run back to the bathroom. It would probably be beneficent over a TP pad/wad combo if the flow was really heavy, it could help 'plug' it a bit. 
TwoXChromosomes X I would still go to the doctor, just to be sure.  Even if a home pregnancy test tests negative, you probably a) want to find out WTF that is, and b) confirm with a blood test that you didn't miscarry.  Especially with how poorly you've kept up with your birth control, I would be concerned about that.  And if you're Rh- and did miscarry, you'll need a shot in case the fetus was Rh+ because you can form antibodies that make any future Rh+ pregnancies impossible.
BabyBumps X Your due date went from my birthday to Halloween! My original due date was Halloween (came a little early!)   Me and this kid are gonna be tight.
BabyBumps X Can't wait until movement gets this noticeable! My husband has been lucky to feel kicks twice so far. 
TwoXChromosomes X Unfortunately, I've had to take Plan B a few times because condoms break. The past few times have been effective (idk I used them when I had a good chance of not getting pregnant but I wanted to be sure), guess this one time just failed. If you're really worried, yeah go get a pregnancy test. I know this scared me into getting a third form of birth control. Might as well walk around covered in pillows in case I get a booboo. 
BabyBumps X It's just part of pregnancy sadly :( Some days will be better then others, and hopefully your morning sickness wont carry out past the first trimester. Baby really doesn't need much right now, just eat and drink whatever you an stomach. 
BabyBumps X I don't have a general practitioner...I used my OB/Gyno as my primary care physician.  I haven't had a full physical in YEARS.  But I do get my yearly pap.  As long as my blood pressure is good, my pap is normal, and I feel OK, I'm good with that.  But I am 27, and generally healthy as a horse.
AskWomen X How do you know they aren't exactly what they're supposed to feel like? Mine have gotten stronger as I've gotten older, but I can't have as many of them. When i was a teenager, I used to be able to have somewhere around 12-20 weaker orgasms, now I can only have one or maybe two, but they're much more intense than they used to be. It's always a much more intense experience when someone else gives them to me than when I give them to myself. Not every orgasm I have in a given time range is the same. They vary orgasm to orgasm and go through phases of feeling different ways. Some are mind blowing, others are just pleasant endings to nice sensations, but aren't super exciting or scream inducing. I'd guess whatever you're experiencing is normal for you, but they'll likely change through time and be different with different partners. 
BabyBumps X I just miscarried about two months ago. The cramps were pretty bad, blood clots were bad and there was, what my doctor liked to call, an "impressive" amount of blood. My doctor told me if I see anything worse than slight spotting to call her. OBs are used to it! Definitely call and find out what's going on, i'm sending good vibes your way!
BabyBumps X [You may be right.]( )  &gt;To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must work for a covered employer and:      have worked for that employer for at least 12 months; and     have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of the FMLA leave; and,     work at a location where at least 50 employees are employed at the location or within 75 miles of the location.   
Parenting X &gt; When you smoke often, weed doesn't incapacitate you.   then why do it at all? "i drink regularly so alcohol no longer incapacities me, but omg i just can't function unless i've had a fifth or two. i'm not an alcoholic, though..." if you have to be intoxicated to take care of a child, you probably shouldn't have a child in the first place.
Parenting X If "smoking pot" was replaced with "having one drink of alcohol" would you react in the same alarmist way?    Also, show me your implied [car-accident statistics regarding drivers under the influence of cannabis.]( -alcohol-impairs-driving-more-than-marijuana.html)    I'm not saying that smoking pot has no negative effects or consequences.  However, everything reported about cannabis is bullshit, plain and simple.  It is NOT harmful like cigarettes or alcohol - it is many many times tamer by comparison.   Don't believe the hype!!!   
BabyBumps X [38 weeks last Thursday]( )  I'll be 39 weeks tomorrow and conditions are favorable for labor! Soft cervix, partially dilated and thoroughly engaged head of a baby in my pelvis :D :D   And the progression: [Album]( )
Parenting X Thanks for the advice. On the one hand I feel more prepared this time around, as I've done the newborn thing now once already. But my somewhat lack of panic (compared to the first time around) is somewhat disconcerting; I keep asking myself what I need to do to prepare, etc. So this is very helpful.
BabyBumps X Well, I started out barely across the border line from "overweight" and into "obese", so my bump really just looks like the tire I used to have around my waist (40 lbs ago). So... no bump pics from me until it actually **looks** like a bump and not belly fat. (currently at 12 weeks)
BabyBumps X I had the cramps up until 7-8 weeks OP.  From what I've read, and from what my doctor has told me, the cramps are exactly from what your doctor told you.  If there's any bleeding, best get yourself to a doctor.  Other than that, it'll eventually get better:)  Good luck and welcome:D
beyondthebump X *hugs* I'm so sorry to hear about your little boy. That breaks my heart :-(   I hope the following is helpful to you and doesn't scare you any further. Spoiler alert- The end result is 2 beautiful healthy children that I love more than anything. I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed for you and baby ;-)   I had a very similar problem with both of my pregnancies. However, I wasn't able to get a cerclage because I was also contracting for several months due to an irritable uterus. So in my case, I had both issues working against me at the same time.   It was discovered that I was in preterm labor with my first at 31 weeks. (I hadn't been feeling the contractions so I was already dilated to 3cm/90% effaced before I was checked.) They tried to stop it but it was too late in the game. They did slow the labor down though, and I labored for 6 days on very high doses of magnesium before delivering. At the time, we had no idea what started the preterm labor.   With my second, I was automatically high-risk because of my history. I started weekly progesterone injections at 16 weeks because it is supposed to calm the uterus. Baby looked great at the 20 week ultrasound, but I am sure that they did not check my cervix then. At 24 weeks, testing began. A vaginal ultrasound showed that my cervix was shortened. If I remember correctly, it was 2.4. This did concern the doc, especially because of my previous preterm history, but she didn't want to make any decision until the results of the fetal fibronectin test came back the next day. The OB used the fetal fibronectin test simply as a predictor of possible preterm labor. Positive results are less conclusive than negative results. Basically, if the result is negative, you are pretty much guaranteed not to have the baby within the week or maybe 2 weeks. If the result is positive, there is a chance that you could go into preterm labor at any time. My result was positive. Not good. So, the shortened cervix coupled with the positive test result led my doc to "sentence" me to strict bed rest, starting at 24 weeks and continuing through the rest of my pregnancy (3 months total). Oh, and to make matters worse, the non-stress test (NST) showed that I was, again, having contractions that I was not feeling.   I even talked to the doc about cerclages and she said I wouldn't have been able to get one anyway because the contractions would have ripped it out. So, I was on procardia (a heart med used for preterm labor) every four hours and strict bed rest, except to go to testing 3 days a week. The bad news is that my cervix continued to shorten and then I slowly started to dilate. Every time a major change occurred, I was back in the hospital on magnesium.    THE GOOD NEWS!?!?!?! I was able to keep that darn baby in until 36 weeks!!!! The DAY I went off of bed rest and meds, I went into active labor and delivered incredibly quickly (keep in mind that I was checked the day prior and was 5cm dilated and fully? effaced).   Some great things about your situation as compared to mine: 1. You were able to actually get a cerclage which could very well keep that baby in for the duration.  2.  The doc didn't mention bed rest or changing your routine yet so hopefully that means that there is not a major concern yet. However, my doc said that they couldn't do much for me before 24 weeks, and so that is when testing began. Therefore, strictly my opinion, but if I were you, I would take it easy. 3.  The fact that your cerclage is holding well may possibly mean that you are not contracting-which would be excellent :-)   I really feel for you, KittyBombip. I know how scary it is. I was a nervous wreck through my entire second pregnancy. From 24 weeks, I tried every moment to push away the constant feeling that my baby could be born that very day, knowing all too well the chance of survival. Every day that passed, every week that passed, was something to celebrate. They were all milestones to me.   The cervix is tricky. Sometimes, it can hold very well when it is very short. I saw so many OBs and perinatologists and I was assured more than once that some women have a shortened cervix and carry baby to term. Obviously, that was not in MY cards but it definitely does happen.    Also, a friend of a friend had a cerclage that ripped and she still carried the baby to 36 weeks. In her case, there were a few docs arguing over whether or not she should be on bed rest. She did not end up doing bed rest, but I am not sure if her activity was modified. I don't know exactly when her cerclage broke, unfortunately.   If you have any questions, please ask :-). I will do my best to answer them. You can also PM me if you ever want to talk or you need any advice as the pregnancy progresses. I truly hope everything works out. Stay positive! All pregnancies really are different.
TwoXChromosomes X The pill + condoms because I tend to be really lazy about taking the pill at the same time every day. It's handy though, because it gives me more control over my period.
TwoXChromosomes X I just switched to Loestrin, after having been on Yasmin (and generics of) for about a decade. Mr Undead noticed an immediate decrease in grump! F'g hormones. Happy to report no weight gain, no breakouts (the main reason I toughed it out with Yasmin so long), and I'm hopeful that the headaches I was getting from the Yasmin are a thing of the past.   TL;DR: if you get side effects that bug you from one oral contraceptive, it's worth trying different brands to find one that interacts less aholishly with your body chemistry
TwoXChromosomes X that is why I'm worried about the pill. If I cant remember to take my multivitamin every day, how will I remember to take the bc pill?
BabyBumps X I will totally send you some! hooray! Also, mine might be a couple days late because of these wonderful car repairs:P I'm so excited to get everything out and sent though!
BabyBumps X My childbirth classes are offered by my hospital, I'd ask them if they have any kind of childcare classes!
BabyBumps X Troll baby had better spread 'em on Friday as we're forking out $175 for this 3D ultrasound!! I think an indefinite grounding will be in place when baby's born if he/she chooses to be stubborn again, haha!  Congratulations on your most likely girl! I can't wait to be able to refer to baby as he or she.
BabyBumps X The sleepless nights have begun! I guess it's good preparation for when baby is here though.
BabyBumps X Your belly is amniotic fluid + baby + placenta. So that's like three and a half total babies.
TwoXChromosomes X Pap smears are the easiest thing in the world. I don't know who told you it was a horrible experience, but it's really not something to be worried about at all!  huckflen gave an excellent summary of what happens in one. All in all, the time spent in your private bits is less than 60 seconds. My ob/gyn is super efficient and it only takes 10.   It's a great feeling when you're done knowing that everything is healthy and checked out.   If you have a bad experience, switch gynecologists. I've had the best luck with female gynos, but the main thing is to find one that is sympathetic, listens, and is gentle.
BabyBumps X YES!!! I am pregnant with number one and we found out at 6wks 3 days and the time has been flying by since! I am a week away from the third trimester! Ahhhh!!!!! Doctors appts are becoming more frequent now! 
BabyBumps X I definitely think you can do it without.  But just to give you some perspective about the epidural, my mothers wore off when she was in labor with me.  It was a long labor and they gave her the epi more towards the end, but it wore off pretty quickly.  She said going from feeling nothing to strong contractions was not bad for her- she was just thankful for that little bit of rest she had been able to get.  I just wish she was with me right now to tell me the specifics, like how many hours into labor she had it (I think it was over 20 though) and how long the epi actually lasted.
BabyBumps X Sorry about that I could be off on how far along I am! My LMP was May 30th but ovulated on the 17th of June. 3 weeks and 2 days, right? (I was going off of [this website]( _calculator.html#trimesters_explained))
TwoXChromosomes X It starts with being completely obsessed with my weight. I jump on and off the scale repeatedly for about 10 minutes. Once I figure out what is happening, the anxiety sets in -- which is usually about the time when I become sore all over. Given the physical pain and soreness accompanied with the cramps, then the exhaustion sets in along with the irritability of the state I'm in. 
BabyBumps X I enjoyed going to a 5 week-once a week Bradley class. It was really layed back. I can't say I learned a lot but I did come away more comfortable with the process of birth and the many options and situations that can arise. More then anything I enjoyed going with my husband, it gave him insight to what I am going through and what he can expect. My husband learned more as he did not know much about kids and birth. I also enjoyed the time it gave us to focus on baby together and the discussions we would have after class. I would recommend it. 
BabyBumps X Where are you looking at birthing classes? All the hospitals in my area offer free birthing classes if you're delivering at their hospital, maybe look into those and see how you like it? They are specific to the hospital, which is nice because you know what order things will generally go in, but I think they focus more on a medicated birth than a natural one(although they do mention natural births, just not as in-depth). I would try one of those out first and see if you want more information or if a class that is more specific to your birth plan would be worth the money.
BabyBumps X It could maybe be sciatica? Do you have shooting pains going down into your butt cheek? I had that in my first and early 2nd trimesters, but now I don't feel it I think because of the shift in my center of gravity, or because my SPD &amp; SI Joint pain are worse pains so I don't feel it :/
BabyBumps X We didn't take a formal class, but did do the online thing offered through BabyCenter. It was okay in terms of information, and I feel like it covered the basics. My husband already knew what worked and what didn't as far as taking care of me during the birth, but we did look up some massage techniques.  We used massage and he breathed with me, and the nurses were fantastic and were guiding him whenever he seemed unsure. I ended up with an emergency c-section due to a partial abruption, so the "birthing" never happened.  I think whatever gives you peace of mind is a good investment. If you check out the BabyCenter thing (it's free, easily found on the website) and feel like you would benefit from a more targeted or interactive learning experience, you can always choose to pay for a class.
TwoXChromosomes X They've found home births to be pretty safe for women who are not at risk.  That is mostly limited to women who have given birth previously without complications and who live close to a hospital in case there are problems.  For first births, they generally recommend you do it at a hospital.  Of course, it's completely your choice.  You can choose to do it in a hospital but with a midwife.  That's what I did for my second.
Parenting X **IF PLANNING ON BREASTFEEDING** please do not supplement formula before the milk comes in, unless the pediatrician says it is necessary. Babies really don't need milk/formula for the first few days, only colostrum. My milk didn't come in until Day 5 and that's absolutely fine. I kept the free samples I was sent just in case, but didn't need them so I donated them to a food bank.  If formula feeding, carry on and feed as you are told to, never done it so I don't know.
BabyBumps X I'm gonna take a shot and say boy. I'm almost always wrong though. I keep having dreams about having a boy, so I'm prolly holding a girl. xD
BabyBumps X I work on my feet, but my hip pain tends to spread into my tailbone. Boo. I can only imagine how uncomfortable I would be if I had to sit all day!  Good luck!  
BabyBumps X Psychosomatic. You are worried you might be pregnant, you are going to get pregnancy symptoms.   When is your period due?
TwoXChromosomes X Personal experience: I adore it.  I skip most periods (although my period gets evil and decides to happen any way at around the 3 month mark so I have 4 periods a year because it's easier to just let it happen.) but I also took it the "standard" way and was shocked to have almost no period cramps as opposed to my usual 1 day of near paralysis and wanting to die. So yeah, I like it.
TwoXChromosomes X I had a similar bruise with mine. I had it taken out last week after three years. Very minimal bruising that time around.  I was not a happy camper with Implanon, but I stuck it out because Planned Parenthood refused to take it out for free before using it at least two years. I went from having semi consistent periods to having non-stop spotting for months and months. The last year of using it, I still had spotting in addition to periods every two to three weeks that lasted 6-8 days. As for mood issues, the first year I had random crying spells and some anxiety.  While I know a lot of women absolutely love Implanon, I wish I had stuck with the pill.
TwoXChromosomes X Try running around your room bottomless more often so being bottomless won't make you so nervous.  The actual exam feels pretty much like being at the dentist. A person with latex gloves stickin' their fingers in you. :/
BabyBumps X When I lay on my side after work, mine starts dancing and pummeling my ribs. It can hurt like hell, but I love feeling him move around in there. Oh, and his stretches. Hurts, but it just kind of makes it more real that there's a little person inside me. 
TwoXChromosomes X At my first few attempts to masturbate I never had fun because I was too focused on trying to climax. Needless to say I never did until I tried it without trying to climax, then I climaxed.               Best of luck!!!!!!!
CsectionCentral X there are some cool sites to help turn a baby.  my friend had a c-section BEFORE my daughter's due date and she was due AFTER me originally.  all because her son was breech.  i think the best advice given on those links is that even if you have a breech baby you don't have to have a c-section right away unless there is a serious risk. otherwise you can wait until you naturally go into labor and even try to deliver before opting for the c.  i think my favorite thing was the videos.  two breech births and all went just fine.
CsectionCentral X I had sort of a similar reason for having a c-section my first time around. Other then the GD she was showing to be very big, and most importantly her belly was very big and they thought she would get stuck and they would have to break her collar bone to get her out. I'm pregnant now with my second, and I'm going in for a  VBAC. While once again my daughter is measuring large, my doctor this time around is very calming and strongly believes I'll be able to have a natural birth this time around. I want to be able to experience a vaginal delivery, have my daughter placed on my right away, feel more "involved' in the the labor part. But after I had my first for a long time I thought  would just have a repeat c-section because I had such an easy recovery, I liked that everything was plan. But when I actually got pregnant again a little over a year later, after doing a lot of research I decided a VBAC is the best option for me,
CsectionCentral X I'm one of those women that's upset that I got a csection. Very upset.  With that said, I'm kinda terrified of labor. I had 3 and 4 back to back contractions at a time, I was in labor for 30 hours, and it all ended in a scary surgery where I couldn't hold my baby and I was so traumatized I was in some weird state of shock where I was mentally numb to everything.   I want to try a vbac, but I bet I will end up having another section. I don't really worry about uterine rupture since the risk is so low, but I do worry that I might have other complications again that will put me unexpectedly in the OR after another long and weird labor. We'll see how I feel when I'm pregnant again, though.
BabyBumps X Yep!  My care had been transferred from my midwives to a consulting OB due to low platelets.  However, the OB was totally pro midwife and had no problem letting my midwives deliver my baby.  The only problem was I was delivering in a hospital where I would basically get what OB was on call and only 20% of them were the same as my OB, the other 80% wouldn't let my midwives deliver.  So instead of taking the chance, I opted to be induced on a day where my OB was on call, so I would have my midwives there to deliver my baby.  All worked out well, did it without an epidural (which was another reason I wanted my midwives, 'cause I didn't think the nurses would be as supportive) and I have no regrets.
CsectionCentral X I hear ya about wanting the chance to try it.  I think for me the not knowing what to expect or what I would go through with labor (like how it feels to have a contraction) and all that is partly why the c-section happened.  I was super educated but still not mentally prepared for the train wreck ahead of me when the pitocin started.  I knew there was a higher risk of a c-section but I had no choice.  I now want to know what labor feels like without a drug to start it too but I don't get to pick those things from the way my labor starts to how any future child is born.  I do hope it's VBAC though.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been a nanny for a long time and have been with three women (close friends and family members) While they have given birth. I think there is a lot of truth to The Business of Being Born, but I would advise first time mothers to find a hospital that facilitates your birth plan. Each woman will experience child birth differently so while it is important to have a plan in place, it is just as important accept that it is not set in stone. I had a friend who was able to have a completely natural water birth without complications and enjoyed a fairly quick recovery; while my very best friend planned on a natural water birth, but ended up having to lay down so she wouldn't have a heart attack. I completely agree with what the documentary says about moving around during labor. If a woman in labor is allowed to shift her body she can bear a lot more pain naturally; as soon as my friend was kept in bed the pain became so intense she needed pain medication. 
CsectionCentral X I had my baby almost 5 months ago. I waver between thinking that I did NEED the csection, but it sucks that I had one, and wondering if interventions caused my csection (I caved and got an epidural, pitocin, artificial membrane rupture, internal monitoring, several cervical checks, etc).  I am afraid of both hospitals AND birthing at home. I feel like with either, there are risks, and that scares me. :/  I am considering either a VBAC at a hospital, or a planned csection. Both have positives and negatives. For the VBAC, I'm afraid I will have another crappy labor. Seriously, I went to birthing classes, read everything, watched tons of videos, and I remember reading ONE birth story out of hundreds and hundreds where a mama described having contractions for minutes at a time. I laughed and said, "Watch, that would be me." And it was. If I had 1 minute long contractions with a little break in between, or if my few-minute-long contractions had been transition (they weren't, I battled them for more than 5 hours before I whispered that I needed an epidural)... I could have done it. But I feel like my labor was all messed up. The deciding factor on the csection for me was tachycardia in my little baby... his heart rate was almost 200bpm constantly and not fluctuating with contractions. He wasn't in the best shape when he was born either, he barely even cried.  But if I could do a VBAC, maybe my second labor would be shorter? Maybe my body would know what to do this time? Maybe healing would be awesome, and I would get to experience natural birth, and I would feel great about my experience.  The other side of the coin is csection. If I planned it, it could be a serene event where I could bypass the scary labor part and go straight to calmly meeting my baby. Maybe I could hold the baby right when it's born, breastfeed right away, be more "present" for that birth, and now that I know what to expect, maybe have an easier time with healing from the section.  But csections are major surgery, and I didn't even want ONE section, let alone two. Recovery sucked. My body is all weird post baby. I hated not being able to get out of bed and take care of my baby, I HATED the IV's and catheters.   So yeah, long story short, that's where I'm at. I don't even know when I wanna get pregnant again because of it all. I get so emotional reading birth stories and VBAC stories and I just feel like that will never be me.   HUGS from someone who understands &lt;3
TwoXChromosomes X I've given birth twice, both times in a hospital, and none of them required me to give birth on my back. I had an epidural with my first, so I wasn't allowed to stand up, but i was on my knees, my side, you name it. With my second I didn't have an epidural so I was walking around up until 5 minutes before my son was born. They had a shower in the labor room if you wanted to get in the shower, a personal bathroom, etc... 
TwoXChromosomes X During my 3rd year as a medical student I had to take 5 weeks of OB. The one thing I would like to share with all of you, the longer you make your birthing plan/document the more likely you are to become a c-section. Doesn't matter what your birthing plan indicated, it's just what happened.  Also if you're thinking about c-section because it seems neater/less painful/quicker just know it is a violent procedure. We had one delivery that needed it (10lb baby) it took 3 people pushing on the abdomen with full force plus a vacuum assist to get this baby out.
TwoXChromosomes X Cranberry pills saved me from frequent UTIs. Just pop one before or after sex, and it'll allow your body to flush out all the bacteria when you pee.  I prefer [AZO Cranberry]( _cranberry). It also contains vitamin C and a probiotic.
TwoXChromosomes X Using the Mirena (hormonal) IUD for 2 years now. I previously had the copper IUD for three years... but it made my period heavier and cramps really painful. I've had no problems with the Mirena since I've had it!
TwoXChromosomes X I have always become really depressed/suicidal with hormonal BC in pill form.  I took LoEstrin and LoLo Estrin, which were absolutely terrible.  I'm actually thinking of getting an IUD soon and am curious about the two options as well.
BabyBumps X HA! Congrats!   Everyone assumed that I was having a boy. I did too! So much for mother's intuition! My SIL and 3 close friends are/were recently also pregnant. So far we have 2 girls, not including mine, 1 boy and 1 unknown. So exciting!!
Parenting X Second labours should be easier.  Also with a second labour induction is easier and less painful (apparently).  I think there's even a drug they don't have to use because the cervix has already been dilated before.  I would definitely pick the epidural, I've never yet met anyone who has regretted it, and everyone talks about them like the most wonderful thing that ever happened!  I wanted one desperately but the timing was wrong (too slow, then too quick/progressed when they next checked).  Best of luck and congratulations!
AskWomen X _cup -expert/6970/menstrual-cup -- has details/specs on the different brands/options  They're more comfortable than a tampon, as far as I'm concerned. They're a bit messier to take out, obviously. I've had fewer 'leak' issues than with tampons: I've never actually had one leak, per se, it's essentially equivalent to the string on the tampon getting saturated and rubbing against your panties.  I find them exceptionally more convenient/cleaner, excepting the emptying/cleaning process. You can empty it a lot less frequently than you'd have to change tampons, though, which is incredibly convenient. Also more comfortable to swim in.
TwoXChromosomes X Hmmm I have had several UTI's have not experienced symptoms like that with them however I recently got a yeast infection, for the first time, and it felt similar to what you are describing. I had absolutely no other symptoms (discharge, odor, etc) other than an almost stinging feeling at the opening of my vagina and very slight itching of my labia. And I do know that antibiotics can cause yeast infection.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you been tested for the MTHFR mutation?  It's one that often gets overlooked, because technically speaking it's not so much a clotting disorder as it is a metabolic problem.  I've had two extremely extensive DVTs, and it turns out that was the issue.  It took four years before somebody thought to test for that one.
beyondthebump X I didn't have any night sweats this time around really, very minor, but it lasted a couple weeks. Had it pretty bad with my daughter and it lasted 2-3 weeks. I did have insane chills this time though. It was really bad for like 2-3 days then I still got them a few time a day (but not call-the-nurses-24-hour-line-because-you-don't-know-what-the-f-is-going-on bad) for a couple weeks. Oh, gotta love those hormones!
BabyBumps X That was about the size of my bump at that point as well. I can only imagine the comments to come my way in another month or two. I may just start telling strangers it's twins so to avoid the dropped jaws :)
TwoXChromosomes X Also ya I forgot to add that might freak me out a bit about not having a period haha. Do you take pregnancy tests every once in awhile? My sister on a patch and she takes a test I think every month or so because the patch makes her period light to nonexistent.
BabyBumps X This actually brings up a serious question about enemas for me. :P My plan A is a hippy crunchy birth center with a big hot tub. I would prefer any interventions that keep me from pooping in it. Any experience with that out there? :P  
AskWomen X I swear by Instead Cups (one-time ones) not for day-to-day use, but for specific situations. I've found them to be about as leaky, maybe less-so, than a tampon for heavy days. Admittedly, my heavy days involve changing the tampon every two hours.   Instead cups, because they do sit all the way back there, can be used while having sex. I find this useful for partners that I don't necessarily want to have to deal with period-sex, but do want to have sex with while on my period. Wanted to throw that part of the discussion in.
TwoXChromosomes X Expulsion can happen, but the chances are slim and the chances of you not noticing, thinking you're protected and having sex and getting pregnant are even slimmer. However it is recommended that you check your strings monthly to verify it is properly situated, and if it isn't you would obviously use a backup method. If you're super paranoid you can simply do this before having sex each time, and after the first year expulsion is even rarer.
TwoXChromosomes X No, I don't stress. As needlepointidiocy said, on hormonal birth control you do not experience a real definitely-not-pregnant-period. The "period" is a placebo period. So why would a fake period give me more reassurance?
TwoXChromosomes X I use an fertility app on my phone! It charts your menstrual cycle and fertile days. I have been using it for years. I think it is meant for ladies who are trying to get preggers but I use it as a way to avoid pregnancy. I can't take hormonal BC either, it takes me into such a deep depression.
beyondthebump X I also started the mini pill 6 weeks postpartum. I don't think it has affected my supply at all.    We had to supplement for a while in the beginning because she was premature and couldn't latch. I built my supply up over time and at around 5 months, she stopped formula completely. She is almost 9 months old now, and I am still nursing her without any supplemental formula :-)
AskWomen X 23/f, and I got the Mirena IUD in August of 2009.  I love it.  I'm terrible at remembering to take pills (so being on the pill would be disastrous for me), and it's actually the first form of birth control I've ever had.  I couldn't be happier.  The insertion and healing period (about four weeks) was uncomfortable, but once it settled in, it was just fine.
Parenting X relax. There are documented cases of Pregnancies going as long as 52 weeks (A full year!)    I was 3 weeks "late". They almost never "let you" go that long these days. Don't let the whole thing get into your head, and don't think that missing your due date by a few days or a few weeks is going to be the end of the world. When your body is ready, you'll have your baby.     That said, my wife took a "dancing for birth" class, and went into labor that night. Turns out that 2 other moms from that class also went into labor that night. So, taking a dancing for birth class (or doing whatever motions such a class entails) seems to induce labor. 
TwoXChromosomes X It depends, are looking for something to use on your clitoris or to use internally?  No, you don't need to use lube if you feel that you are wet enough, but lube certainly couldn't hurt (unless you're allergic, ugh).  There are cleaning solutions available specifically for sex toys, but I just use plain ol' hand soap and water.
BabyBumps X Due to a large baby and extra fluid, my doctors have said that it's possible that I could go into labor at any time and I'm only 36 weeks.    How does lung development change from 36 to 40 weeks?  At what point do you see that the babies are early but most of them do as well as a full term baby?    Also, I've heard it said that 37 weeks is full term and then I've heard it said that the babies born then need a little more help getting going than the babies born at 40 weeks.  What are the differences in a 37 weeker and a 40 weeker and why is it often said that 37 weeks is term?  Thank you!
TwoXChromosomes X This sounds like a [Bartholin's cyst]( 's_cyst). They are very common and can occur anytime. I had one a couple of weeks ago and I didn't even pop mine. I just left it alone and after three or four days it disappeared again. I think you're right in going to the doctor for the large ones, you don't want the infection to spread by popping them yourself. 
TwoXChromosomes X Personally I would think having a kid is way more important than your weight. So there would be nothing stopping me getting the children whenever I want. I don't know anything about you, your weight or your health, but maybe you fuss to much about your looks and your weight to get your big life goals accomplished (like another baby)? Just a question, maybe this doesn't aply to you. It just somehow seems weird to me that weight loss and getting pregnant are in a battle, cause for me getting pregnant would have a much higher priority.   Maybe you can combine both in a healthy way. If you are pregnant, eat healthy and do healthy excercises. Not with the goal to lose weight, but because it's good for you and the baby, so don't starve yourself or anything. Personally I didn't gain any weight (only the babies weight), and had my old weight a few weeks after birth and also lost lots of weight while breastfeeding. I would say it was because I ate healthy, did moderate excersises and never overate.   Hope you will find your way and a decision that makes you happy :)
BabyBumps X It's just a part of pregnancy, and hopefully yours passes soon :( Baby is still *very* tiny and it's totally normal to not be showing yet. I went down from 192 to 176 the first 17/18 weeks of my pregnancy from such terrible morning sickness. I hope yours goes away soon! Have you tried seeing if the doctor will prescribe you something?
AskWomen X I'm late to this post, but I love love love my Divacup and I think I've been using it close to 5 years now.  It was 29 bucks when I first bought it, and it's saved me a ton of money I would have spent on tampons over that amount of time.  It took a few days' practice when I first started using it to learn how to get it in and make sure it was sealed so there would be no leaks. I can wear it about 12 hours without having to remove, rinse, and reinsert it, so it's much more convenient than tampons.  And if it is in correctly it literally NEVER leaks unless it is overfilled (like 12+ hours for me).  Someone below was saying they're "messy" and gross or something, but I find mine to be far more hygienic and clean than tampons ever were (there's no string to get gross all day).  With a little practice you aren't spilling it everywhere or anything at all, and when you wash it and put it back in properly, it's like you aren't even on your period until you take it out again.  I've also had less painful periods since switching.  Anecdotal evidence and maybe not the case for everyone, but it's made a big difference.  Livejournal is uncool now but there's a great discussion forum that has info on comparing different cups and etc over here: -cups.livejournal.com/  The info in that community helped me tremendously when I was making decisions about which cup to get and just getting more used to the idea, etc.  Check out the "browse by topic" on the right side.  Hope this helps you!
TwoXChromosomes X As far as I know, my doctor said that it was safe. Technically, I skip the inactive pills of three packs, so that's more like 84 days. If you ever do decide to get birth control, ask your doctor about how long you can go without one. 
TwoXChromosomes X How do you have private time to have sex? Get it then! Take a cab or the bus or bum a ride from a friend. Send your partner to get it.  While the immediate answer is to stand up for yourself and communicate with your partner, if you are going to continue to be irresponsible, you have more options than the pill! Look into long term solutions, like Depo (every 3 months), an IUD or the implant.   Also, look at vaginal contracptive films and the sponge. Both have higher failure rates though. See the [comparison of effectiveness of various methods]( _of_birth_control_methods#Effectiveness_of_various_methods).  But if you have unprotected sex for a year, you have an 85% chance of getting pregnant. The answer is not to continue having unprotected sex.
BabyBumps X Hunny, try not to freak out.  We're here for you, and while labor isn't always the most fun thing to go through (the end is pretty cool though, you get an awesome baby), it's nothing to fear.  If you choose, you can ask for all the pain meds, so you won't have to be in a bunch of pain.  You'll be with trained professionals that will be there for you for the labor and delivery, there to keep you and your baby safe.  Plus our bodies are made to do this. :)
TwoXChromosomes X The spotting isn't unusual when you stop taking fake period breaks.  I do not think the pelvic pain is related to that. Everyone has that sometimes, I'd only worry if it was constant or extremely painful.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm just going to guess and say that your period is just sneaking through anyways. I had a similar thing happen when I took extra pills but not the break and my period ended up taking twice as long but with a really slow flow
TwoXChromosomes X Yep normal. Some people get it at different times. Usually takes me 2-3 months of skipping to start getting what you're getting, then I just let my period come and am fine for another few months.
beyondthebump X I exclusively pumped for about nine months; my daughter was in the NICU for an extended period of time and had to be weighed before and after if we wanted to breastfeed.  I started out pumping every two hours around the clock, and then backed off to every three and would pump about 1.5 liters and up in a 24 hour period (I recorded every session). My supply did end up drying up around 9 months or so, but I wasn't pumping as regularly and had quite a bit of stress - I think if I'd been less stressed / more regular with pumping, I would have been fine for as long as I'd wanted to pump.  My biggest problems were oversupply and recurring mastitis from the oversupply. The biggest thing that helped I think was recording every session - when I started, when I stopped, and how much I pumped. That made it easy for me to see if I was getting less and then I'd pump more often to get my supply back up. I also used a hospital grade Medela pump for most of the time; there's a significant difference between hospital grade and home-grade. If I end up pumping again, I will rent a hospital grade pump because I noticed such a huge difference when I switched to a regular pump.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;That is actually a big quarrel I have with the majority of pro-lifers. You have mentioned in a previous comment you are for medical exceptions, but until recently, that was unheard of from many pro-lifers. I feel they only adopted it because of how quickly their bills got shot down without the exception in them.  I just think that's just common sense to be honest, I always believed in abortion in those cases because it is an act of self defense. I would never support any bill that would ban life or death situation abortions. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you know what you're doing and are careful, they're very reliable. I was in a relationship for three years where condoms were the only BC, and I had to take Plan B once because we accidentally let the condom slip off afterwards (a problem we learned how to avoid).  Just be smart about it. :)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;i honestly feel that this is something that absolutely sways people to choose abortion.  What if you just don't want to wreck your body and go through child birth for something that, if taken care of early enough, unquestionably can't think, can't feel, and that holds no spiritual or emotional value to you?  That desire will remain no matter how thoroughly adoption and healthcare are reformed.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; As long as she doesn't tell me I am wrong for my beliefs then I have no problem.  That is what pro-life means though - the pro-life movement's goal is to prohibit abortion.
BabyBumps X I called. They told me to come in for a check up so I'm on my way.    SCH is sub corheneal (I cannot spell that word so pardon me) hemorrhage. It's basically where part of the placenta won't lie down in the uterus. Fairly common but does cause bleeding since it has to bleed itself out before it can try to lay down again like a scab. Only dangerous if it's too big. Mine was small. 
BabyBumps X Our hospital supplied diapers and wipes.  For the baby, we brought a sleeper, an outfit for the photo, a hat, scratch mits, car seat, and velcro swaddles.  We are expecting a big baby so we brought newborn and 0-3 months outfits.  For me, we brought a pajama set, plush socks, slippers, nightgown, lip balm, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, hair clips, my favorite water bottle, hard candy, tooth brush and paste, a book, and a outfit to go home in (sweat pant, t-shirt).  For dad, we brought change for sodas and snack machines, an extra t-shirt, deodorant, cameras, granola bars (labor is long, he gets hungry).
beyondthebump X I've been exclusively pumping from the start. I have twins that are five weeks and it has been the best decision for us.   They were born at 36 weeks and had latching problems. The lactation consultants at the hospital weren't much help and even my mom who is a labor and delivery nurse and spent hours with me trying to get them to breast feed couldn't do it. I still try everyday but it usually ends in tears for all three of us.   My supply has been able to keep up with the two of them and it's been awesome to have other people be able to feed them while I take a nap or just get out of the house for a couple of hours. I'm happy, they're getting breast milk and gaining weight. I do wish I had that 'connection' that I've heard about with breast feeding.
beyondthebump X I think it depends on the hospital.  I was never given any mesh underwear people keep talking about and those huge pads they gave us were very large and uncomfortable, I wouldn't take them home even if I could!  Nor did they give us nipple cream and we were encouraged to bring our own diapers.
TwoXChromosomes X If you had your period on time last time, and haven't had sex since, you really shouldn't be pregnant. Stopping birth control can often throw your period off. Take a pregnancy test.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you talked to your doctor about it?  I have had the same problem.  The only thing that really worked was a 6 month course of the oral antifugal fluconazole (Diflucan).  I had 3 back to back and since that haven't had another.  The only other suggestions I can think of -- eat a lot of yogurt, avoid anything that could be irritating or change the environment in your vagina, e.g., sex without proper lubrication, sex in water like shower sex, pools with too much chlorine, natural hot springs, scented or colored soaps (even if you're not putting it on your vagina), or anything else that might come in contact with it.
BabyBumps X they wait for the blood results.  She told us our measurements were fine, but couldn't give us our chances without the blood results.  
BabyBumps X I'm still puking and I'll be 33 weeks tomorrow.  I get random times where I'm not super pukey and stuff like that which is nice little breaks but I now know they are breaks and the puking will come back.  Some of us just get unlucky :/
AskWomen X He's putting himself at high risk for contracting STDs by doing that. If you are into sloppy seconds with hookers, you *really* need to use protection. 
BabyBumps X I'm still puking and I'm almost 23 weeks. It's tough, I've never stopped puking though. I've been on zofran the entire time. It's frustrating to say the least. Just try to keep well hydrated, because dehydration is one of the main causes in morning sickness.
TwoXChromosomes X The iron supplements haven't helped with the bruising? I bruise terribly, but i'm also anemic and haven't been quite on top of taking my vitamins.
BabyBumps X For the first time the baby is straight up and down, head in my crotch, feet in my ribs.  I had my first hard rib kick yesterday and thought "Oh dang so that's what the bumpers are talkin about... "  For the longest time her feet were off to the side, kicking away into nothingness and feeling great.  Those days are over.  Still love it though.
BabyBumps X I think she should adopt... or abort if possible.  I don't think a person should bring a child with severe disabilities into the world if they are not ready to devote that much time/money/energy into raising one.  Some disabilities, as cruel as it may sound, are better off aborted before the child spend their entire lives suffering.  (I'm talking about disabilities that cause constant excruciating pain and suffering that are incurable and have a low chance of survival).
BabyBumps X A baby. :). We'll be on a reduced income while I take maternity leave, and I don't need anything. 
BabyBumps X LMAO!!!  Well luckily the hunger pains didn't kick in and I was able to get to sleep;)    p.s. how many of you now want cherries?  LOL:P:P:P
BabyBumps X Yup.  When I was in labor with my daughter, my water hadn't broken.  The nurse came in and said "We may need to break your wat-" and I interrupted her and said, "No need... it literally just broke as you started to talk."
TwoXChromosomes X Did you take your pill correctly?  This doesn't make any statistical sense.  This pill is over 99% effective if used perfectly while the diaphragm is only 94% effective with perfect use.  
TwoXChromosomes X Mine has sort of regulated itself over the years.  I would get sporadic 4-times-a-year periods as a teenager.  Several years of BC use followed.  Upon going off BC in spring 2011, periods were sporadic, but I've had a pretty consistent cycle the past few months.  I have also fallen into a very reliable daily routine - I eat the same things every week, go to the bathroom the same time every day, work 9-5, and have very regular sleep patterns.  
AskWomen X I really enjoy it, but usually the best way to get into it is to start off with a good amount of foreplay and even a little vaginal intercourse first.  My current bf is really well-endowed (length plus girth) so it can be very, very painful without the proper lubrication and without being really turned on first. 
BabyBumps X My first was induced 3 days after he was due and born the next day. While some first babies come early, most don't.
BabyBumps X Totally normal!  I stayed the same weight up until around 16 weeks, then I put on like 10lbs in one month.  Not gaining weight, or even losing weight, can be totally normal in the beginning of pregnancy.  It starts to become an issue as you get farther along- if your doc wasn't concerned, you're probably fine!
TwoXChromosomes X Have you both had herpes blood tests?  There is a blood test that can identify whether you are infected when you are not having an outbreak, which is often the case even if you have NEVER had an outbreak, and can identify whether you have HSV1 or HSV2.  I recommend you both do this (if you haven't) so that you can know which strain he has, and then you can see if you have it.  If you haven't had a herpes blood test it's honestly likely you have it since 80% of adults have HSV1, and he could even have HSV1 genitally in which case you have nothing to worry about.  You can't get the same strain in two places, and with just a blood test you wouldn't know where you had contracted it anyway.  Now, let's say you don't have it.  While yes, it is possible to contract is when the infected partner is not having an outbreak it is unlikely (more likely during the day or two before an outbreak).  How often does he have outbreaks?  Does he know what the signs are that it may be coming along?  In the long term you would be likely to acquire it at some point if he gets frequent outbreaks.  Are you willing to take that chance?  Really, it's up to you.  If he had cold sores (oral herpes) would you feel the same?  If you decide to it's true that it's just a numbers game.  Many people are able to have long relationships where they do not infect their uninfected partner.  Other people do not have that luck.
BabyBumps X I am totally doing a hospital birth and any pain meds they offer. I had a rough go with my first pregnancy, twins, abrupted placenta, emergency c-section. So I am going to try VBAC but i definitely want the pain meds.
BabyBumps X You're fine.  Sounds like you're off to a great start too...not losing anything, not gaining anything. You're likely spot on too...converting other weight into baby weight.  :)  It's how I was my first trimester too.  I just hit 29lbs total weight gain at 39 weeks.
BabyBumps X My induction sucked and I posted the story of it in this subreddit after I got home. The medication they used to dilate me didn't work, so had to be manually dilated. They gave me an epidural which also didn't work. They gave me sudafed while I was in labor because I couldn't breathe through my nose, and that shot my blood pressure through the roof. They had to use a suction cup to pull out the baby and she aspirated a lot of fluid. I am just extremely grateful that she defecated right after she was pulled out, and not while she was still in the amniotic fluid.   I am very happy, though, that I didn't have to have a c-section. I also am happy to hear that a lot of inductions go well for people. 
BabyBumps X This has really been bothering me lately. Not you, personally, but the trend lately to see childbirth as a "birth experience" for the mother - a rite of passage or an event for her to personalise and put her stamp on it. Because birth isn't always easy, and it isn't always smooth - women and babies DIED, and died frequently, before modern medicine.   Now we have procedures that save lives, but because of the encouragement and pressure to design a "birth experience", women end up feeling robbed of something they feel they earned, or were entitled to, instead of feeling the joy of being a mother at the end of it.   I feel like the focus of birth should be to get a healthy mommy and healthy baby first and foremost. Anything after that is nice, and should be accommodated if possible, but I feel sad for mommas who planned a birth for so long, only to have unexpected complications. Their fantasy comes crashing down and it's the mother who suffers.  I had a LOT of interventions in my son's birth, and it saved his life and mine. I feel no regret or longing for an "experience" - I don't feel I was cheated. I was given a precious child of my own. 
BabyBumps X The reason a lot of women feel upset afterwards is because a lot of interventions are unnecessary. I will not feel depressed about my experience if the baby or I are in danger, but most of the time "failure to progress" is a bullshit excuse of a diagnosis and comes from a doctor just wanting to get this over with rather than letting the woman actually birth her baby. The c section rates are astronomical in the US and it isn't because they are necessary. 
BabyBumps X I didn't start gaining weight at all until week 32. I'm only four pounds over my pre-pregnancy weight now, and I'll be 35 weeks on Friday. I say if your doctor isn't concerned, you shouldn't be. :)
BabyBumps X The funny thing is, my emergency occurred because of a doctor unwilling to do a C-section when one was indicated. He prided himself on having a very low rate of C sections, and kept repeating this,  despite the fact that I have a small Asian pelvis and my son was 10.5 lbs with a large head and nearly 2 weeks overdue.    By the time they took me to surgical, he was too far down to get a section, but stuck so firmly he couldn't come out (double dystocia, cord around neck). It was a mess. 
BabyBumps X I don't know if it's normal, but I feel the same way.  I am terrified to have a baby.  I mean, like actually have it, in my care, all the time.  Like, "what am I supposed to do with this baby?"  It's all become very real.  I am excited to meet him, and experience this whole birth thing, even if it's painful, it's temporary... the results of said birth are quite permanent.
BabyBumps X probably because your lives *were* at risk. unfortunately c-sections (and inductions) are done in a great many cases where no one's life is at risk, and so women feel less like they went through a life-saving procedure and more like they went through a time-saving (and money-making) procedure for the OB.  in my case, my OB planned to induce me from the beginning, but never bothered to tell me. so i spent 9 months imagining this perfectly normal, cookie-cutter vaginal birth and then when i hit 37 weeks it was "surprise! i'm inducing you in 2 weeks!" she actually got mad at me when i told her how upset i was at the news and that she didn't tell me sooner because "most people are totally fine with being induced." that doesn't mean you keep information like that from your patients! i went through all these birthing classes at the hospital where she worked that went on and on about how important it is to avoid interventions and the whole time she was planning one of the biggest ones because of the .1% chance i'd go into labor spontaneously AND deliver within the 12-hour span of taking my heparin shot (in which case i still could've been given a vitamin k shot to reduce bleeding).  i don't think it's unreasonable for a woman to want to experience the feeling of birthing her child the way nature intended, or to be upset when that is taken from them for reasons that aren't medical emergencies. for most mothers it's "i rushed to the hospital and labored for 37 hours and pushed you out of my body!" for me it's like "oh, my OB wanted to make sure she could take christmas vacation so i was hooked up to drugs and when those didn't work she just cut me open and pulled you out."
BabyBumps X I wouldnt worry about it too much, strangely enough my doctor told me that I had *lost* 4 pounds at my 15 week appointment last thursday (She also mentioned that I should gain around 15-20lbs during my pregnancy altogether). She also told me its not uncommon to lose weight, but the fact that I've been eating pretty frequently throughout the day totally dumbfounded me as to how the hell I was losing weight.  But, like the others have said, if your doctor isn't worried about your weight then take it as a good sign :) 
BabyBumps X I'm a size 18 lady. I've gained a total of 7lbs. So it can be perfectly healthy for your body to do what it's doing. My midwives are unconcerned :)
BabyBumps X In Germany midwifes are not allowed to prescribe medicine, but they are allowed to handle special medicines when needed and have medicine at the birtn center. The really interesting fact for me is, that doctor's are not allowed to deliver babies without midwives, but midwives are allowed to deliver without doctors.
BabyBumps X If the baby is not tolerating labor, that is not an unnecessary diagnosis and it is not what I mean. What I mean is the arbitrary 12 hour time limit that many doctors put on women as soon as they enter the hospital, saying after a few hours that she hasn't dilated enough, or she has been pushing for an hour and it has been too long. 
TwoXChromosomes X They gave me an anti-spasmatic as that worked for me my last day in the hospital. It sort of helps, but the pain is only a 2-3 right now so I don't need it much. My sister had kidney stones and that seemed like some serious pain. 
BabyBumps X Oh that's so horrible. ): I can't imagine aborting that far along whether for medical reasons or not. I would just have to put the baby up for adoption if I were in that situation and can't take care of a child. 
BabyBumps X Loved your post!  I read all of the birth plans and stories and love reading them. However, for me, I didn't get pregnant to have a birth experience. I got pregnant to have a baby. I feel like I'm in the minority with my plan of, go to the hospital when contractions are close enough, try to breathe and relax and avoid drugs/epidural if possible, and listen to my doctor and nurses. I've researched so I'm going in knowing as much as I can, and my doctor knows I want to try for a natural delivery, that's it. :).  Needing an induction, or an epidural, or even a c section will not be the end of the world for me. :). I get a baby at the end.  
BabyBumps X It will just be my SO, me, midwife and nurse(s).  Our families live 1000 miles away, we don't really have many friends here, so it's not really a concern.  Finally went on a tour of the birthing center today, and learned that they have a policy that only 2 support people (e.g.. SO and Doula) can be in the delivery suites.  They said they will actually allow more people in the room, but the policy is in place, so they can be the "bad guy" and kick people out with an enforceable rule.  Where I am delivering, they move you to a recovery suite 1-2 hours after delivery, at which time normal visiting hours apply... but I am pretty sure either way, the nurses are more than happy to say you cannot take visitors.
TwoXChromosomes X You'll be fine! My best friend, who is 14, had an ovarian cyst about the size of a golf ball. She had surgery to have it removed, and has been on the pill since then. She was in a lot of pain before and right after the surgery, but is healing now. :)
BabyBumps X I hope she stays in there longer to keep cooking! All my good vibes are being send your way!   Today I haven't even taken off my tracky dacks! It's too cold!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm in my 20's and I've used mine.   It's a perfectly fine method that is non-hormonal.   Very nice alternative to the Pill, costs less than an IUD (out of pocket).  I wish they were more common, honestly.   The 94% success rate takes into account ALL use:   the studies are required to count uses where a woman did not insert it properly, did not use spermicide, or left it in for more counts of intercourse than suggested.   Misuse is included in the failure rate of contraceptives, you can look that up online.   The diaphragm is easier to misuse, but I'm sure you will be fine.  Best of luck!
BabyBumps X Did no good for my third lol... She was born a day shy of 42 weeks, after weeks of prodromal labor.
BabyBumps X Okay, that would place you at about 5 weeks pregnant if you were.  Generally a home test would pick that up by now.  Wait a week and test again.  Once you are two weeks or more late and still having negative tests, then call your doctor.
BabyBumps X My primary motivation is that I don't believe that childbirth is necessarily a medical emergency, and most of the time, no medical intervention is needed.  Sometimes during *some* births, there will arise a medical emergency, but for the most part our bodies are *designed* to give birth with relative ease.  Really, pregnancy and childbirth are the primary functions of the female body, and I feel fairly confident in my body's ability to deliver this baby without medical intervention.    Also, as many others have said, there are a lot of natural processes that your body goes through (and your baby's body) during birth that interventions interfere with.  Your hormones are completely different after a medicated birth than after a natural birth, in part *because* of the pain and the ordeal you've just been though.  And these hormones are very essential in the initial bonding process of mom and baby.  
TwoXChromosomes X But not being able to see it doesn't change what it actually is, and I think people should know what the fetus at that stage of development looks like and more importantly what stage of development he or she is at internally. I'm not sure if the abortion doctor counts the age of the fetus from the date of conception or if he/she adds on the two weeks of your period, here is what a medical site says:  &gt;It might seem strange, but you're not actually pregnant the first week or two of the time allotted to your pregnancy. Yes, you read that correctly!  &gt;Conception typically occurs about two weeks after your period begins. To calculate your due date, your health care provider will count ahead 40 weeks from the start of your last period. This means your period is counted as part of your pregnancy  even though you weren't pregnant at the time.  As I said I am not sure where the abortion doctors start count from, so here are the three weeks in question:  &gt;Week 6: Growth is rapid this week. Just four weeks after conception, the neural tube along your baby's back is closing and your baby's heart is pumping blood.   &gt;Seven weeks into your pregnancy, or five weeks after conception, your baby's brain and face are rapidly developing. Tiny nostrils become visible, and the eye lenses begin to form. The arm buds that sprouted last week now take on the shape of paddles.   &gt;Eight weeks into your pregnancy or six weeks after conception, your baby's arms and legs are growing longer, and fingers have begun to form. The shell-shaped parts of your baby's ears also are forming, and your baby's eyes are visible. The upper lip and nose have formed. The trunk of your baby's body is beginning to straighten.   To clarify week 6 is actually a 4 week old fetus and week 8 is a 6 week old fetus.    ([Source]( -care/PR00112/NSECTIONGROUP=2))   I agree that pro-lifers making misleading signs is dishonest but I see nothing wrong with knowing what is *actually happening*. I mean if you were to see any surgery, unless you were a trained doctor with special tools, all you would see is gore and blood but in reality there is much more than that going on. 
TwoXChromosomes X The fact that the source even uses the word baby at that point in the pregnancy is hugely misleading. It's not even a fetus at that point. It's still medically considered an embryo.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure of the specifics! Maybe it has something to do with muscle contraction when using the bathroom?  I used pantyliners with it, just in case, for the first few cycles but haven't lately since I didn't have any leakage previously.  It's worth a try to see if it works for you.  I like that it doesn't dry me out like tampons do or leave me with an icky string dangling. It seems much more sanitary to me!
BabyBumps X Not til Nov 4th, but I'm hoping for a Halloween baby haha. Or a bonfire night baby (5th Nov) so we can have fireworks for his birthday!
TwoXChromosomes X If it doesn't "seal" then it will leak a little. Just takes a little practice to get it to put in correctly. 
BabyBumps X I've had one induced with pitocin and 2 come on their own. I've never had pain meds.  The only time I want pain meds (and often see the same from other ladies) is at transition, when you are about to have the baby anyway. Knowing this, I focus my thoughts from "I want pain meds!!!" to "this is a sign it is almost over!"  It helps. A ton. Focusing my thoughts, reminding myself "this is transition, it's the worst part, get through it and you can push baby out!" and during pushing "once baby is out, it ends. Get baby out and it is all over!"
BabyBumps X I wanted a natural birth with my first but my husband didn't want me to go through with it because he didn't know how to support me during labor and was too afraid of seeing me in pain to learn how.  I ended up getting the epidural after 2 days of labor so I guess we both kinda "won" that one.    I don't really have any advice on how to win him over since I discovered I like to labor completely alone - he didn't even know I was in labor with my second until it was beyond time to drive to the hospital and she was almost born in the van.  I guess the only thing I could think of is to explain to him that you don't get a choice of whether or not to give birth so he doesn't really have a choice on whether or not to support you and your decisions.
BabyBumps X I have miscarried before. It was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Period cramps x20. I had light cramping in the beginning of this pregnancy too. Just like everyone else is saying. But of course, see a doctor to ease your mind at least. 
BabyBumps X the only reason i knew i was pregnant was because i was cramping constantly but i wasn't bleeding. i believe it's just your uterus stretching out :) if i'm not mistaken, when you are miscarrying it's a lot more painful (plus you'd be bleeding). i wouldn't worry about it unless you do start bleeding.
beyondthebump X I like the body shape of the Vent Aire because it is curved and helps baby get the milk out without you having to hold her practically upside down! I wish my baby had liked the nipple on it because i love feeding my best friend's baby with those bottles!  My baby likes the MAM bottles/nipples. WILL NOT take anything else. They are wide and flat and simulate the nipple when it is sucked into baby's mouth. It is also the pacifier she likes best.   However, every baby is different. I suggest that you buy several types (just single bottles) and wait to see which your baby likes BEFORE you buy a bunch. I didn't register for bottles because each baby is so individual. I registered for bottle accessories like the microwave sanitizer, bottle brush, etc.
TwoXChromosomes X Does it fade stretch marks? I also have stretch marks from teenage growth spurts. :(
BabyBumps X This [1998 study]( ) of 100 mothers determined that mother's intuition on gender is about 70% right. That's significantly better than 50% so you may well be right.  Anecdotally, both my husband and I had dreams that our baby was a girl before we found out the gender.
TwoXChromosomes X I would argue that if you call forced abortions "murder, pure and simple", then you're already decided on the issue of late-term abortion because (sorry if I put this too bluntly) you are only changing makes the decision to kill the child.  The end result is the same.
TwoXChromosomes X FYI we do have F21 in Canada, just in certain cities.  I've have decent luck there actually. It's kind of like H&amp;M where they have so much selection and you need to try on about 5-10 things to find one really awesome item. I bought a dress there in March for about $20 that I've worn at least 15 times since then and I love it. It's holding up well and I get compliments on it nearly every time I wear it. I'm turning 30 next week, so it can be done!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm 5'9".  I was about 160 (that's a little overweight for me) when I got pregnant the first time, and I maxed out around 205.  I was about 10 pounds lighter for my second pregnancy at both the beginning and at the end.
BabyBumps X Husband and doula for labor and delivery. My parents will get a phone call and can come visit shortly after baby arrives (or sooner and be in the waiting room, they live about 30-45 minutes away). My brother and all the in laws (who live farther) will be sometime after that.  At least a few days, maybe more. I want time to rest and bond and heal before we have visitors (other than my parents who have their own home nearby and who I fell comfortable setting boundaries with as needed). 
BabyBumps X The vast majority of medical organizations in the world with a policy on circumcision are outright against it. including:  [Swedish Pediatric Society]( _News/World-News/2012/02/19/Swedish-doctors-urge-ban-on-circumcision/UPI-61961329678560/) (they outright call for a ban)  [Royal Dutch Medical Association]( ?uuid=579e836d-ea83-410f-9889-feb7eda87cd5&amp;owner=a8a9ce0e-f42b-47a5-960e-be08025b7b04&amp;contentid=77976) calls it a violation of human rights, and calls for a "strong policy of deterrence." this policy itself has been endorsed by several other organizations, including:  The Netherlands Society of General Practitioners,   The Netherlands Society of Youth Healthcare Physicians,   The Netherlands Association of Paediatric Surgeons,   The Netherlands Association of Plastic Surgeons,  The Netherlands Association for Paediatric Medicine,   The Netherlands Urology Association, and   The Netherlands Surgeons Association.   They are currently planning a [symposium]( -2/Agenda-item-algemeen/The-doctor-and-the-foreskin.htm) for this June to evaluate whether to ban it. one of the speakers is a man who did a recent study showing a decrease in sexual sensation in circumcised men, and an increase in sexual difficulties for them as well.  [British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons]( -Infant-Male.pdf)  &gt;This procedure should be delayed to a later date when the child can make his own informed decision. Parental preference alone does not justify a nontherapeutic procedure.... **Advise parents that the current medical consensus is that routine infant male circumcision is not a recommended procedure; it is nontherapeutic and has no medical prophylactic basis;** it is a cosmetic surgical procedure; current evidence indicates that **previouslythought prophylactic public health benefits do not outweigh the potential risks.**.... Routine infant male circumcision does cause pain and **permanent loss of healthy tissue.** |  [Australian Federation of Aids organizations]( __data/assets/pdf_file/0019/4528/BP0709_Circumcision.pdf) They state that circumcision has "no role" in the HIV epidemic.  [The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan]( ) has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it.   The [Central Union for Child Welfare]( ) considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person **Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.**  The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above).  Swedish Association for Sexuality Education published [this guide]( -rfsu/Resources/Publications/Dicktionary/) that talks about circumcision, in a pretty negative way. not an official advocacy policy but it makes it fairly clear. it also talks about how the frenulum is sexually sensitive, and helps prevent infection by blocking fluid from the urethra; the frenulum is often removed in an infant circumcision, yet easier to leave intact if an adult is circumcised.  [Royal College of Surgeons of England]( _circumcision.html/attachment_download/pdffile)  &gt;"The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis). This is unusual before five years of age."..."The parents and, when competent, the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of this operation as it is a non-reversible procedure." |  [British Medical Association]( _and_capacity/malecircumcision2006.jsp#.T39wGY5QUgR) &gt; **it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks.** .... **very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification.** Furthermore, **the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individuals relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure.** .... parental preference alone is **not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child.** .... The BMA considers that **the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.** |  [Australian Medical Association]( ) Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says "The Australian College of Paediatrics should **continue to discourage the practice of circumcision in newborns.**"  [Australian College of Physicians]( ):  &gt;"The possibility that routine **circumcision may contravene human rights** has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is **without proven medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court of law** .....**Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication.** It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to **remove a normal and healthy prepuce.**"|  I love that statement about human rights. it mentions that the only way to determine the validity is to ask the courts. as if it's not the job of a medical organization to take a stand as well.   [Royal Australasian College of Physicians]( ?objectid=65118B16-F145-8B74-236C86100E4E3E8E)  &gt;Some men **strongly resent having been circumcised as infants. There has been increasing interest in this problem,** evidenced by the number of surgical and non-surgical techniques for recreation of the foreskin.|  A letter by the [South African Medical Association]( -NOCIRC-2011-06-25.pdf) said this: &gt;The matter was discussed by the members of the Human Rights, Law &amp; Ethics Committee at their previous meeting and they agreed with the content of the letter by NOCIRC SA. The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission. We trust that you will find this in order. Yours faithfully Ms Ulundi Behrtel|  [Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]( _non-therapeutic_circumcision.pdf)  I like this one especially. It's a detailed evaluation of the arguments in favor of circumcision, they note that during one of the recent trials in Africa, the researchers claimed the re was no loss of sexual satisfaction. but the RACS called them out:  &gt;"**Despite uncircumcised men reporting greater sexual satisfaction, which was statistically significant,** Kigozi et al (2008) concluded that adult male circumcision does not adversely affect sexual satisfaction or clinically significant function in men." In general, they discuss how there's no evidence to support it.  [this study]( ) shows significant harms to men's sexual ability and satisfaction after circumcision.  [Here's a page]( _files/Page351.htm) from an activist site that has a short list of some organizations as well, with a few other details. most I already listed though.
BabyBumps X I don't know what would be better, but I know its not too late to change to a midwife.  If that's what you want go for it.  I don't know how things work there or how your OB feels, but maybe you can ask them for suggestions?  Or maybe ask people you know in your area what places they know that are good, or where a good midwife is located.  Where I'm at you generally start with a midwife either way and then you can request to have an OB if you prefer, or if you become high risk or have multiples then you have to be switched to an OB.  The local hospitals all have midwives on call.  So for me it was quite easy to get a midwife and the OBs here are all for it.  
BabyBumps X Thanks for checking in! I'll post a full update tomorrow or Saturday. Lillian Grace born at 11:01pm PST after 12 hrs active labor. Made it to 9.5 cms, then stalled for 3 hours. Finally took an epidural to relax, pushed 2 hours and she made it out! 
BabyBumps X It would seem to me she should be asking you who is welcome in your home only days after your baby is born. Sounds like she is a bit of a head case and very selfish.  You'll be exhausted and it will be harder to put your foot down then so be sure to make some boundaries for yourself, your SO and your baby.  I would think it is partly up to your SO to deal with his mom and tell her she and her huge clan are not welcome.
TwoXChromosomes X It could be a UTI (urinary tract infection).  Peeing after sex and washing after helps to prevent them.  Cranberry juice or supplements help too (both in prevention and treatment).
BabyBumps X No, not definitively. An experienced ultrasound tech might be able to have a good guess (ie a better than 50% guess) - but they won't be able to confirm. Where I had my 12 week scan, they said it was too early but I have heard some will give an opinion. Still very exciting though - wait til you see it move around...  Plus sneezing is always dicey - always gotta brace yourself for something.
BabyBumps X It's never too late to switch providers. Set up a consult with a midwife who works in a birth center or has privileges at one. Consults are free, and usually an hour long so all of your questions can get answered.  If you don't love what's offered, have a consult with another provider, or stick with the one you've got.   The most important thing is that you (and your partner) are comfortable with and trust your provider and where you'll be giving birth.  23wks is definitely not too late to switch. I've had mothers switch as late as 38wks!  Do what feels right for you and your family. 
TwoXChromosomes X No.  I do not like this thing. It almost happened to my mom (she was 7 months along when she found out about me) and it scares me so much that it will happen to me too.
TwoXChromosomes X [O.b.]( ) tampons! They're super easy to apply, and very comfortable. Tampons are great in the water, just be careful with the string. I just go ahead and tuck my string inside, but then I have no problems reaching in to pull it out again. You don't want a wet string chafing down there though! 
BabyBumps X The genitals aren't in the right position yet. The boy parts are all the way up there and the girl parts are swollen. Unless you do a 3D ultrasound and they're VERY cooperative, probably not. It sucks, but you gotta wait until your 16 week anatomy!! Time will fly!
BabyBumps X Congratulations!  Sounds pretty traumatic with the internal exam there at the end... eesh. I don't think that happened after my PPH, but the doctor had done some pretty painful uterine "massage". I'm sure there's no comparison!  The differences in your two labours sounds a lot like they were for me- transition was hell the first time (no pitocin, mind you), with contractions flowing into one another and feeling like I couldn't move/reposition myself.  This time around I had a lot of relatively short and intense contractions, but with clear breaks.  Transition was essentially no different from the rest of my labour... I was pushing within 15 minutes of being assessed at 7cm, and it was nothing like the first time.   &gt;having a new baby makes him seem sooo much bigger,  omg, this is one thing I definitely noticed. My daughter seems like a *giant* in comparison. I'm not mourning the transition as much as I thought... I think I got most of that over with in the days leading up to delivery. I wrote her a little letter before the baby was born, and I think that helped soften the blow emotionally. 
TwoXChromosomes X She's not trying to say that non-viable embryos are baby lizards. Some people don't classify non-viable embryos the same way as a baby that's been already been born.
TwoXChromosomes X I really can't say what you should do, it's up to you, but I hope you aren't pregnant. Abortion is a tough thing to go through (I just went through it last month), and I wouldn't wish having to make that decision on anyone. So all I can say is I hope that since you don't want to be pregnant, you aren't, and then you don't have to worry about telling him or not.
TwoXChromosomes X It's not 50 percent for most,  it's using all saved sick pay and vacation,  if you don't have those you're SOL,  all you get is a job to come back to.  You can apply for short term disability, but the 12 weeks is usually up by the time it goes through. 
TwoXChromosomes X I prefer Tampax pearl.  Tried the Playtex sport once, but I didn't like the string, it just felt like I could accidentally tear it out.  I'm much more comfortable with the braided-like string on the Pearls.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah - I never got paid a dime, except for saved sick &amp; vacation time. Plus my company doesn't allow roll-over with the exception of 1 week of vacation time, and 2 sick days. So the MAX I could save up was 3 weeks vacation + 7 days sick time, and that was with only being able to take 1 week off work for the year before, and not a day off work for the entire year after. It sucked.   Needless to say I only took 6 weeks off work, since I am the primary earner in my family. 
BabyBumps X Try to get a membrane sweep. If you're already on the edge, it might be enough to push you into labor. I had one yesterday. Contractions started up almost instantly, and seem to be getting stronger.
TwoXChromosomes X The employer isn't, no. It's the state. Maternity and paternity leave are through unemployment offices, but your employer is legally obligated to give you that time off regardless.
TwoXChromosomes X I had to pay a portion of my insurance in California after a certain amount of time. I took 16 weeks of maternity leave. 
BabyBumps X Nope. It was mild.  It may have been related to the assisted vacuum delivery, but I can't be sure. It wasn't a tear. I know my midwife asked whether it happened before or after the placenta was delivered (before), so I suppose that's relevant.   My midwife did do a preventative shot of oxytocin just following the birth this time, even though there was no evidence of hemorrhage . It should have happened as the shoulder was being born, but the backup midwife had not yet arrived and he came out pretty fast, so she just gave it to me afterward.  
TwoXChromosomes X There is no legal mandate, within the US, that requires an employer to allow maternity/paternity leave.  FMLA is only available if you work for a company with [more than 50 employees in a 75mile radius]( ).  So, if you work for a small company, you may not have any leave available (if you hope to keep your job).  Not all companies have STD or you may not be eligible due to being a new hire or only working Part-time.  So, yes, some new mamas-to-be are shit out of luck and that's what truly sucks about trying to start a family in America.
BabyBumps X Looks to me like your hips have hipped out a little. It took me for*ever* to start showing (I'm 6' and started pregnancy at 270lbs) but now I'm finally getting comments like "you actually look pregnant!"  I agree with Mae though, to really tell you gotta be sideways. 
TwoXChromosomes X You can. Pumping sort of sucks though (uncomfortable, makes you feel like a dairy cow, takes a lot of time) and you need a good one (read expensive.) You also need to figure out when you can pump without increasing your supply to a point that causes problems (pump too much and your body will produce enough milk to feed twins, which is a big problem if you don't have twins!) Additionally, some people are worried about something called nipple confusion (I don't worry about this.) So it's possible but might be more trouble than it is worth. I had to be separated from my baby a few times overnight due to health issues, so I pumped then to keep my supply up and have a stash because of that. 
BabyBumps X You missed a period and you got a positive hpt. You're preggers. Go to the doc, or get a digital one. But I'd go to the doc and have blood drawn so he can't deny it.
BabyBumps X I was cut right after I was born.  I strongly resent my parents for taking that choice away from me, against my will.
TwoXChromosomes X This has been the solution that has worked well for me and my wife. After the first month bottles can be introduced without fear of "nipple confusion", and feedings can be split more equally. She still has to pump as often as she would nurse, but she isn't tied to the baby so she can go out and do her own thing when she needs to.
BabyBumps X Honestly, I am currently 32 weeks pregnant, huge, hot, swollen, and baby won't get out of my lungs, and I still feel 100 times better than I did the entire first and most of the second trimesters because I was SO freaking tired.  It bothered me even more than morning sickness... It will get better. Sleep lots. 
BabyBumps X Nothing works until baby's going to come on their own. Anything that "works" for someone, was likely done just before they went into labor anyway, seeing as they didn't try doing these things until they were full term anyway, at which point the chance of going into labor at any given moment is pretty darn high. Often I see "but I had no signs of labor before it happened!" as an example of why it *totally* worked. Except no one gets any signs that they're going to go into labor soon before they go into labor.  I've tried everything through three pregnancies. Honestly all that works is patience and letting baby come on their own.  That said...   Have fun and keep walking.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't agree. Cervical cancer (or precancerous changes) is very treatable if caught early. Most issues, when in early stages, show no sign of 'problems' so you can't really count on that as your sign to get checked out. Gyno exams are very medically necessary. 
TwoXChromosomes X You don't have to work another full year. Just 600 hrs (&lt; 5 months). I know ... I've just done it. Came back to work several months pregnant and getting my full maternity leave payment in a few weeks.
BabyBumps X I would look in to switching doctors, check out your options.  Many ladies here have amazing midwives and OBs and feeling like this so early is going to make you question everything the whole time 
AskWomen X For me, it's the full experience. It's the intimacy, the closeness. My boyfriend hasn't made me orgasm yet, and I don't mind in the least. It's time I get to spend close to him, and it feels wonderful; even without a climax at the end.   And lord knows, I can get myself off within five minutes if I really had to. So it really doesn't matter. I'd rather be closer to him in the experience than have the bang. 
BabyBumps X We have a troll baby too, at our 20 week scan he would not let us find out what he was, cue 20 mins of wriggling, moving, me peeing to see if he shifted and a very patient sonographer, we *finally* get a glimpse of the goods.   It's so exciting :) x
BabyBumps X Before we got pregnant I thought we would wind up with a boy first (no preference at all, just instinct).   When I found out we were pregnant I developed an OVERWHELMING sense that it was a girl. I told my husband this at 7 weeks and he thought I was crazy. Everyone else seemed to think it was a girl too...well at 18 weeks we got confirmation that she is a girl and got our second confirmation yesterday! I totally believe in "mother's instinct" as far as gender goes!
TwoXChromosomes X Which is why she should go and have a low-impact appointment now -- blood test, breast exam, a bunch of questions. Then, when she needs a full internal, she'll be ready/calm, since that first time wasn't so bad.  And if she has any family history of pelvic issues, she needs an exam as soon as she's physically sexually maturing, regardless of what she's doing with her sex life.
BabyBumps X Our little girl does this a lot. I always point it out to the husband because it looks so weird. Definitely have the feet in the ribs too....quite uncomfortable. Feel like they are bruised and tender sometimes. 
BabyBumps X Highly likely round ligament pains and other stretching feelings.  I've had it on and off since about 18/19weeks.  They really suck, but changing position helps.    Do be careful about staying hydrated though!
beyondthebump X I think it's worth your time to work with a LC to get past the latch issues.  Breastfeeding is a relationship; it isn't just about the milk.  The solution could be as simple as using a different position, like nursing lying down.  &gt; Also, I think I have milk that lets down too fast. I felt like little man was drowning every time he ate, and he was getting maaajor gas pains. So i decided to try bottles for a few days, to see if it helped his gas issues (it has, some)  So much of this is conjecture.  It's normal for a new baby to take some time to adjust to the way his mama's milk flows.  And your let down may have had nothing to do with his gas pain.  (And his crying may or may not have been as pain; babies cry sometimes because being a newborn is rough.) 
BabyBumps X I have JUST started getting the stabby crotch pains. They suck.  I haven't experienced the other but any surprising pain I get that goes away and doesn't cause other symptoms, I blame on baby's position or stretching belly....  I'm huge....  :/
TwoXChromosomes X I think it's pretty natural if they're on the longer side. If they're short they tend to poke out and can be uncomfortable for you partner, but when they're cute long then they wrap around the cervix and are hardly noticed.  I wouldn't worry about it, especially with a virgin cervix. Not to mention it sounds like it hurt for it to get put in for you, so if it was halfway falling out then part of the device would be poking through your cervix and it seems like *that* would be incredibly painful if it were forcibly dilating your cervix. 
beyondthebump X Laying down not looking at my OB as she broke my bag of waters. I had to be induced because of preeclampsia and it was one of the interventions they used to try to get me to dilate. 
TwoXChromosomes X If I absolutely have to, I can put a super-absorbent tampon in and wait twelve hours. And that's just what I can go down to the drugstore and buy. Have you ever seen a hospital tampon? They are *intense.* Also diva cups and moon cups, etc... or just friggin' leaking and dealing with it later, unless we end up fighting werewolves I'm pretty sure the enemy can't smell a little blood. I've never taken the whole "but what about the tamponz?" excuse very seriously.  
BabyBumps X Aside from the severe nausea, heartburn, failure of bowels, dislocated coccyx, disaligned hip, pelvis bone, braxtons, consistent peeing, fevers, fatigue and headaches I am great.   Nothing to complain about really. 
beyondthebump X Mine was at 40 weeks, in the hospital, on Pitocin.  It happened after 6-7 hours of labor every time I stood up from sitting on the birthing ball.  Mine was a small trickle, though, due to some medical issues.
BabyBumps X I was sick a few days after my first missed period.  It didn't go away until 12 weeks.  This is my first so I don't have a lot of experience except to say it came EARLY for me!
BabyBumps X I agree. My favorite preggers clothes are from target. I found some super cute tops and dresses!
BabyBumps X With my first, I was relatively symptom free. I would feel kind of nauseous in the morning if I didn't put a little something in my stomach before I got out of bed, but overall my first pregnancy was a breeze.  This time I started feeling symptoms before I could have even taken a test. My LMP was around the first week of December, got my positive test on 1/5, but I had been telling my SO for at LEAST a week and a half prior to that that I felt like we should take a test because my food aversions popped up out of nowhere, my sense of smell was out of control, and my nausea was terrible.   So, you aren't alone in that sudden rush of OMG pregnancy symptoms. It sucked a little bit because I was expecting different after my first, but I took it as a sign of confidence that I knew I was pregnant for sure. ;)
TwoXChromosomes X I just switched to birth control type number 4 because I also don't react well to the extra hormones, but I have terrible periods so I need *something*. I don't have PCOS and I'm not sure we have the same side effects, so I don't know if this will be helpful.  I'm on a progestin-only pill now, which is also called the mini-pill. If I do well on it, I'll probably switch to Mirena, which is the same hormone but at a much lower dose. Progestin-only is supposed to have fewer side effects like bloating/weight gain, although the pill form is associated with more breakthrough bleeding and it's not as effective as a birth control.  What I had to do was sit down with my doctor and go through the different pills I've tried, because while many are the same two types of hormones, the doses/ratios of the hormones vary. My first gyno had put me on a ridiculously high dose pill (Seasonale). I switched to something lower (Yaz), then something even lower (Loestrin 24). Both those types took longer to give me the bad reactions I'd been having, so dose seems to be the issue. The doc switched me to the mini-pill.  I'd look at what you've taken. The two docs I talked to said that the Nuvaring actually has a fairly high dose of hormones (contrary to what I've heard on Reddit) and didn't recommend it for me. Were the other pills you took also high dose?   The next dose down from the Loestrin that still contains estrogen would be Lo-loestrin, which I believe is the lowest available. However, my insurance wouldn't cover it. I've only been on the progestin-only for about a month so I can't say how it'll go, but so far it's been okay.
TwoXChromosomes X You are always responsible for your own birth control, it doesn't matter if he actually is or isn't on birth control. That and sex with no birth-control have a lot of consequences for men too, child-support for once.
BabyBumps X No one has freaked out yet. Despite going out and having strong contractions with three different pregnancies... Many times.  And it makes it suck less to refer to it as prodromal labor. There's nothing "false" about it. It is doing things to our bodies, but not having us be in active labor. The term "prodromal" means "a symptom of a condition that may soon develop"... I find this to be a much more positive way to look at it!!   Prodromal tends to be a good sign that actual labor will be shorter and easier. 
BabyBumps X What the hell? Your doctor should be helping you to find answers. It could be nothing or it could indicate something serious - your doctor shouldn't be brushing you off.  I had bleeding like that and it turns out I had a low lying placenta and my cervix was irritating it causing it to bleed. My doctor immediately did an ultrasound to determine the source of the bleeding and told me to go on pelvic rest (no running, jumping or orgasms). Once my uterus finally grew enough to move the placenta away from my cervix, I was allowed to resume my normal activities.   You seriously need to have a talk with your doctor about determining the cause of the bleeding and/or switch doctors. If you do happen to have placenta previa, it can be really dangerous for you and baby if something goes wrong.
BabyBumps X Depending on the color and amount and if you are having severe cramps... If its a lot of bright red blood and/or accompanied by severe cramps... Yes. Go to the ER.
BabyBumps X She's doing so much better on formula than she ever did on breast milk, and it rather makes me feel like a failure. It sucks, too, because she had a great latch immediately after being born, and never has had any issues with the actual feeding itself. She's an awesome eater, but she just gets so sick. Between that and the troubled labor and the ABO bloodtype incompatibility, it seems like my body is hell-bent on hurting or killing my kid. I'm giving the diet another week or two, I check periodically to see how she reacts to my milk, and I pump and dump in the meantime. Still no luck. 
TwoXChromosomes X In fairness - the great majority of STDs are only considered scary stigmatizing and upsetting diseases because they are sexually transmitted.  If they were transmitted through other means no one would freak out about a lot of them so much (like, genital herpes: terrifying!!, oral herpes: people don't even notice or care that they're infected - though both viruses are nearly identical but for location).    
BabyBumps X This!  Pushing was a HUGE relief, at least for me.  I figured that crowning would be the painful part and it wasn't at all.  By that point, I think your body is so ready to be done that it's like, "EVICT THE SUCKER!"
BabyBumps X You can ask your doctor, but generally severe pain means something you'd call the doctor about in the first place or consider an ER trip.  Especially if there is no blood. Really, your uterus grows really fast so cramping is completely normal and very common.  You're still going through the implantation process (week 6 is placenta attaching nice and firm) and that definitely can cause cramping or spotting.  Don't get me wrong, I'd still mention the pain to your doctor at your appointment, but chances are everything is normal.
BabyBumps X I think it just depends on what the doctor usually does.  The first OB I saw did an ultrasound at 8 weeks and does so for everyone, but the midwives we switched to later typically only do the 20-week check.  I think people who are (or pretend to be, I guess) really unsure about when they conceived are much more likely to get an early ultrasound because the date estimates are more accurate, I've been told, fairly early on.    Usually for the heart beat, they just use a wand thing, called a doppler.
TwoXChromosomes X I was not trying to trivialise the effects, I was just trying to explain.  I don't believe in some conspiracy, but as someone who lives with the effects of the pill and has no other option, yes it can be shitty. I appreciate what it does do, but at the same time a bunch of the side effects are shit. It can just rub people up the wrong way when male birth control is veto'd due to side effects shockingly similar to the ones female birth control has, yet ours is declared safe.  Again, I'm not saying that the male birth control pill doesn't have awful side effects, I was merely trying to show that for a lot of women, we already deal with a lot of side effects and it can be frustrating when certain things are brought up.  As I've already stated in another comment, I would love for guys to be able to have that option as well.
TwoXChromosomes X Yep. Condoms and whatever I was on. I was on the pill for about 10  years and the patch two. I also used the ring when it first came out for a few months.   The IUD has been the best form I've used. 
TwoXChromosomes X Isn't an IUD the solution for many women in cases like that, though-- i.e., women who want long-term birth control but aren't 100% sure they never want (more) kids?  Now I am curious: have you seen many situations in which a woman who had no kids got a tubal ligation and then got it reversed? 
BabyBumps X That definitely wasn't my experience. The pain was pretty rough (my labor and delivery story is here: -then-there-was-you-part-1/).  I didn't want to get the epidural either - my doctor let A's father stay and hold my hand while they administered it though and that was a HUGE comfort. I think my mistake, and why I ended up getting the epidural was because I took the pitocin (the drug that speeds up labor) - once that kicked in, my labor pain went from a 3 to an 8 or 9 in no time. I wish I had let my body progress naturally!   Honestly, however your labor goes, once you have your beautiful baby in your arms, it will be the most amazing day of your life! 
TwoXChromosomes X Mirena definitely works due to hormonal methods. However, because it's that much closer to the site of action, the overall levonorgestrel (progesterone) dosage is significantly less than that in the pill/patch/ring/depo. You also skip the estrogen in the pill/patch/ring, which is the main risk factor for the worst (but rare) side effects of the pill like blood clots in the lungs or brain. But the physical presence of the plastic Mirena alone, without hormones, would have minimal contraceptive value.  Source: I'm a resident doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X If you do, talk to your doctor as you might have a hormonal unbalance caused by Polycystic ovary syndrome. _ovary_syndrome
AskWomen X By preventing the release of an egg, it doesn't matter how much your partner ejaculates inside you, if you've taken it properly you have a very small chance of getting pregnant.   The shot and the bar have the lowest failure rates, and condoms rank lower than the pill in terms of failure rate.
beyondthebump X You might want to check out /r/breastfeeding to see the links on the side about normal newborn breastfeeding habits. It's possible that she just wants to suck A LOT and the bottles are satisfying her sucking need, but that she doesn't really want the extra milk. As in, could you leave her on your breasts for longer? Like, several hours? Would she just continue to suck but not get upset? If so, then she's just looking to comfort nurse and probably doesn't need the bottles. If she gets super fussy when you're not having letdown etc. then yes, she's probably still hungry. But if at all possible, I'd suggest just sticking with the breastfeeding right now - for as long as she wants to stay nursing.   Obviously I don't know your situation, but it takes up to a few months for your supply to stabilize and introducing bottles of formula and pumping/giving bottles this early may make it tricky for you to keep your supply long-term. Just my 2 cents though. :)
TwoXChromosomes X Yes you should go. Even if you are not planning on being active it is good to know that your body is working like it should. You may not have to have a pelvic exam this visit, but you will have to talk to a doctor. The appointment isn't all that bad, you and the the doctoe will talk about your health and then preform an exam if it is needed, you will be given a very stupid looking paper dress to wear and a big paper sheet to cover up with. If you do have to get the exam done, the doctor will have you lie back and you will put your feet up, remember to tell the doctor that you are a virgin so she uses the smaller tools, you will feel a slight pinch and some pressure during the exam but it is all over in a few minutes.   It really isn't as scary as people make it out to be. One thing to remember is that if the doctor makes you uncomfortable you should ask for someone else. 
BabyBumps X The day before she was born we went to the mall.  "when are you due?" "the 14th" "oh, of October?" "nope, September." "...but it is the 26th, why are you still pregnant?!" "because I haven't had the baby yet."
BabyBumps X "I'm glad you aren't one of those people who got huge and yuck pregnant towards the end," too, but lady, you have 3+ weeks left!! With both of my previous pregnancies, I was a pretty cute, all belly pregnant person... until the last month! I puffed up and out like crazy those last couple of weeks!  Obviously, just because that's what happened with me doesn't mean it will happen with you! I hope it doesn't, but I know even if you do "puff," you will be beautiful!
Parenting X Our first was also supposed to be natural in a hospital. I wish I had received some other advice. We were dead set on doing this naturally. My wife was in labor for 40 hours. In the end, as I mentioned above, she was dehydrated and exhausted. She got an epidural.  I felt awful, and like I had failed in my only duty (which was to keep the nurses from pushing us quickly into the drugs which we determined to not be necessary). For some reason, this labor just felt like a disaster. So much so that it affected me for several months afterwards. All I had to do was be there for my wife, and I was pretty bad at that.  Anyway, the advice I offer is this: the goal is to have your wife safely give birth. That's it. Whatever means lead to that goal is a victory for both of you. Don't stress out if your approach has to change.
Parenting X I had good intentions both times of having natural births. Unfortunately I ended up with c-sections both times. My number one suggestion would be to talk to your wife about induction **prior** to her due date. I wish that I had not allowed myself to be induced. I think it is what ultimately ended up causing my c-sections.  However, when you are 10 months pregnant it is easy to think that induction is the answer. If you know her stance on induction you'll be better able to support that when she is struggling. 
Parenting X Be an advocate for her when she is in labor. Voice her wants to the medical personel. I literally lost the ability to make decisions when I went into transition and would have agreed to anything thrown at me. I needed another adult to be a firm voice of reason.  Ty to avoid medical induction. Natural labor contractions are much easier to deal with in comparison to pitocin contractions. 
TwoXChromosomes X You've already gotten a lot of answers, but I'll add that most doctors advise you to go into a vasectomy assuming you'll never be able to have it reversed. Storing sperm is a better option than reversal- no unplanned pregnancy, but the option's still on the table if you think biological children may be in your future.
Parenting X We've been studying since we found out. We are planning to have the baby in the hospital, and we have read the "Bradley Book." We are also planning to being my sister-in-law sort of as a doula. She's experienced in home birth as well.  I really like the Bradley Book and felt it gave a good foundation. Thanks for the advice.
TwoXChromosomes X You really ought to try to see a doctor. Cranberry juice can help prevent a UTI but it doesn't really treat them, and if you're in serious amounts of pain I'd be worried about it progressing to a kidney infection if you don't get some antibiotics soon.
BabyBumps X If you can find one locally, hire a doula. They are trained to be your support system in getting you the birth you want. They can run interference on drs/nurses/well meaning moms, and usually are trained in pain management techniques to actually help you get thru without caving to the constant suggestions of epidural.   If there are doula certification programs in your area you can even find free doulas who are looking to complete their training hours. 
BabyBumps X I'm going in next Friday for the blood draw for the quad screening.  My OB said that this is *just a screening* and that there are possibilities (though small) that it may come back a false positive. I'm not a worrier, so I'm not concerned much. If it's positive, I'm going to have one of the other tests done, anyway, as confirmation.  I posted a pretty controversial thread about what one would do if they found out they were having a baby with special needs. Well, since I, nor anyone in my family, is fit to parent that kind of child, I want to know as early as possible, because I *will* be aborting if it's positive... It's awful for me to word it that way, or maybe even do it, but I know the facts in my situation and there is just no way. I've heard the heartbeat already and I'm attached, but I *could not* let it affect my decision. I'm sure there are future chances of conception, so I'll not stress...  However, I'm confident that my body would have miscarried (again) if something were to be wrong.   *Edit: It also helps that my insurance fully covers these tests, so I don't pay a dime out of pocket for them. I may not be at risk, by why not do it if it's free, not invasive, and very probably accurate for our age group?*
TwoXChromosomes X You're implying that taking Valtrex prevents immunity. Many of us have week immune systems to begin with and need viral suppression. Where's your info on how taking Valtrex prevents the development of immunity? Seems bogus.   **Are you anti-Valtrex b/c you don't have access to it? Seems that way, to be honest.** How's that built-up immunity working for you? If it is, great, but please keep in mind that some of us need medications to be symptom free.  Here's some [info]( -herpes.htm) on outbreak frequency: *"People diagnosed with a first episode of genital herpes can expect to have several (typically four or five) outbreaks (symptomatic recurrences) within a year."* OP is clearly one of the people who does get outbreaks.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;As for it being easier for men to get sterilized-- There is no other birth control option for men with that high of a success rate. Condoms have a failure rate of 2% with perfect use and 10-18% with typical, compared to a &lt;.01% for perfect vasectomy and .15% for typical vasectomy. No form of male birth control even comes close to that level of protection, so there are no other options really to push like there are for women.  Sure there is!  Have any guy go on the following drug regimen:  [100 mg of spironolactone]( -492-spirotone-100-spironolactone.aspx) twice daily.  [2 mg of oestradiol]( -166-estrofem-2mg.aspx) twice daily.  [5 mg of medroxyprogesterone]( -350-provera-5mg.aspx) once daily.   This will serve as an extremely effective contraceptive. After a few months, sperm production will stop and the chance of pregnancy will be damn well near zero.  There may be certain...side effects...but nothing too extreme I assume.... :3
BabyBumps X Why can't you have tacos? I got lucky too, I was nauseous all the time but I never threw up at all. I've got a friend who was sick from day one until she delivered, and now she's preggo again and sick already at like 5 weeks! It might NOT get rough for you, remember! Some ladies just have easy pregnancies!
TwoXChromosomes X HPV is not herpes. Also, I am 25, have slept with 12 men, have never had unprotected sex, and have some type of HPV. Nevertheless, I only know that because I have taken a specific STI test, as I have never had any symptoms ( warts and whatnot) and it is highly unlikely that I ever will. Therefore, I cannot pass it to anyone else. HPV REALLY isn't that big of a deal ESPECIALLY for guys, who very rarely show symptoms of it, compared to girls.
BabyBumps X I had spotting at 6 weeks. They did an ultrasound then and didn't find a heartbeat but my doctor said that was perfectly normal for so early on. Literally all they could see was the sac the baby was in. They didn't get a good heartbeat on ultrasound until 8 weeks for me.   *hugs* I hope everything turns out alright :)
TwoXChromosomes X He's the father to a zygote. It's still his DNA replicating in her uterus, even if it won't ever be more than a zygote.
BabyBumps X I got the triple screen test.  It tested my blood so no risk to the baby for miscarriage.  I had to know even though I am low risk.  I don't know what I would have chosen had it came back positive, but I needed to be prepared.  In the event it was positive and I decided to keep the child anyway, there are certain things to prepare for.  Some medical conditions require medical attention.  I wanted to be as emotionally prepared as possible.
TwoXChromosomes X Haha thanks for your comments, helps to commiserate!  I am in Canada, and as soon as you have two pap tests in a row with abnormal cells, they send you for a colposcopy.  I have had one colposcopy where I cleared the abnormals cells altogether, and then I had a pap smear again within 6 mths and the abnormal cells had retuned.  My last colposcopy did not reveal abnormal cells, but the pap smear performed just prior to the colposcopy did. Go figure! I swear I have had every combination possible in the past few yrs.  Yes, my cells are always low grade, hence why my doctor and nurse have never referred me for LEEP. I once raised the question to them after reading an article about the risks associated with repeat colposcopies (since I've had so many I've kinda lost count). They said they could refer me to a gynecologist for a second opinion but that they advise against LEEP if it is not required (as it is invasive), as in my case.  I always tell the doctor and nurse I want to get it over with as quickly as possible. I often see the procedure referred to as "uncomfortable"... I find it a few notches above uncomfortable, it's more the awful anticipation imo!
Parenting X They really aren't unclean, and infections are not easy to get. only 1% of males will ever have a UTI, compared with around 60% of females, according to the National institutes of health.  Here's some info specifically for parents from medical organizations: ?PageID=DIW000995  The vast majority of medical organizations in the world with a policy on circumcision are outright against it. including:  [Swedish Pediatric Society]( _News/World-News/2012/02/19/Swedish-doctors-urge-ban-on-circumcision/UPI-61961329678560/) (they outright call for a ban)  [Royal Dutch Medical Association]( ?uuid=579e836d-ea83-410f-9889-feb7eda87cd5&amp;owner=a8a9ce0e-f42b-47a5-960e-be08025b7b04&amp;contentid=77976) calls it a violation of human rights, and calls for a "strong policy of deterrence." this policy itself has been endorsed by several other organizations, including:  The Netherlands Society of General Practitioners,   The Netherlands Society of Youth Healthcare Physicians,   The Netherlands Association of Paediatric Surgeons,   The Netherlands Association of Plastic Surgeons,  The Netherlands Association for Paediatric Medicine,   The Netherlands Urology Association, and   The Netherlands Surgeons Association.   They are currently planning a [symposium]( -2/Agenda-item-algemeen/The-doctor-and-the-foreskin.htm) for this June to evaluate whether to ban it. one of the speakers is a man who did a recent study showing a decrease in sexual sensation in circumcised men, and an increase in sexual difficulties for them as well.  [British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons]( -Infant-Male.pdf)  &gt;This procedure should be delayed to a later date when the child can make his own informed decision. Parental preference alone does not justify a nontherapeutic procedure.... **Advise parents that the current medical consensus is that routine infant male circumcision is not a recommended procedure; it is nontherapeutic and has no medical prophylactic basis;** it is a cosmetic surgical procedure; current evidence indicates that **previouslythought prophylactic public health benefits do not outweigh the potential risks.**.... Routine infant male circumcision does cause pain and **permanent loss of healthy tissue.** |  [Australian Federation of Aids organizations]( __data/assets/pdf_file/0019/4528/BP0709_Circumcision.pdf) They state that circumcision has "no role" in the HIV epidemic.  [The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan]( ) has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it.   The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above).  The [Central Union for Child Welfare]( ) considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person **Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.**  Swedish Association for Sexuality Education published [this guide]( -rfsu/Resources/Publications/Dicktionary/) that talks about circumcision, in a pretty negative way. not an official advocacy policy but it makes it fairly clear. it also talks about how the frenulum is sexually sensitive, and helps prevent infection by blocking fluid from the urethra; the frenulum is often removed in an infant circumcision, yet easier to leave intact if an adult is circumcised.  [Royal College of Surgeons of England]( _circumcision.html/attachment_download/pdffile)  &gt;"The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis).

The BMA considers that **the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.** |  [Australian Medical Association]( ) Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says "The Australian College of Paediatrics should **continue to discourage the practice of circumcision in newborns.**"  [Australian College of Physicians]( ):  &gt;"The possibility that routine **circumcision may contravene human rights** has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is **without proven medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court of law** .....**Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication.** It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to **remove a normal and healthy prepuce.**"|  I love that statement about human rights. it mentions that the only way to determine the validity is to ask the courts. as if it's not the job of a medical organization to take a stand as well.   [Royal Australasian College of Physicians]( ?objectid=65118B16-F145-8B74-236C86100E4E3E8E)  &gt;Some men **strongly resent having been circumcised as infants. There has been increasing interest in this problem,** evidenced by the number of surgical and non-surgical techniques for recreation of the foreskin.|  A letter by the [South African Medical Association]( -NOCIRC-2011-06-25.pdf) said this: &gt;The matter was discussed by the members of the Human Rights, Law &amp; Ethics Committee at their previous meeting and they agreed with the content of the letter by NOCIRC SA. The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission. We trust that you will find this in order. Yours faithfully Ms Ulundi Behrtel|  [Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]( _non-therapeutic_circumcision.pdf)  I like this one especially. It's a detailed evaluation of the arguments in favor of circumcision, they note that during one of the recent trials in Africa, the researchers claimed the re was no loss of sexual satisfaction. but the RACS called them out:  &gt;"**Despite uncircumcised men reporting greater sexual satisfaction, which was statistically significant,** Kigozi et al (2008) concluded that adult male circumcision does not adversely affect sexual satisfaction or clinically significant function in men." In general, they discuss how there's no evidence to support it.  [this study]( ) shows significant harms to men's sexual ability and satisfaction after circumcision.  [Here's a page]( _files/Page351.htm) from an activist site that has a short list of some organizations as well, with a few other details. most I already listed though.
BabyBumps X About 80% of american adults have oral herpes. 1 in 5 has genital herpes. It is highly contagious. On the bright side though it isn't dangerous, merely unpleasant. info: 
BabyBumps X I'm only 35 weeks and I have all of this, except the contractions. The pelvic pressure is unbelievable. My doc did a NST, and said everything still looks ok, but all of these signs worry me a little that he'll come too early. 
BabyBumps X I've had a few pardon the TMI "ooze" feelings where I wiped and it was like I blew my nose (clear though) and then I've had random bits of mucus that looked like EWCM. It's not every time I go to the bathroom though. 
BabyBumps X I started at about 4-5 weeks, but this is my second baby.  I didn't have any symptoms at all (except a missed period) with my first until about 7-8 weeks.  And everyone is different!  
AskWomen X It depends on what form of pill you are taking. If it contains oestrogen, the window is larger and its not so important to take it at exactly the same time each day - the 3 hour period isn't ideal but should still be effective. However if you are taking the progesterone only pill ('mini pill') it is important to take it at the same time each day! :)
AskWomen X In 2 houses I've lived in, the other ladies of the house just toss the pad into the garbage for the world to see. With the newer pads, you can wrap the previous pad in the new pads wrapper, but they still don't do that. What the heck? Starting to feel like I'm the only one who wraps it in TP or whatever else.
BabyBumps X I had a zofran pump from week 6 to week 13, so pretty much the moment the first trimester ended it cleared up. I've heard of women going into delivery with their pumps still attached, so as terrible as it was for me I know it could have been a lot worse. I hope yours clears up soon, just keep reminding yourself that it WILL go away! 
BabyBumps X Lol I feel ya sister, that "I'm not denying it is happening but doesn't feel like the baby will ever come" phase.  I don't know when reality will set in, prolly different for everyone.  My Husband is probably annoyed with how much I get excited over every big kicking session.  It happens all the time but I love it all the time.  I'm so excited for you to start feeling big kicks!
BabyBumps X Good point. My wife just had our child and she didn't go in until the contractions were about 5 mins apart and still she had to wait until pretty much overnight until the baby was born. I would be sure to go in when it gets to that point or when the pain is too much.
AskWomen X genetics sucks ~_~ my periods can last for weeks then i go without a period for months, and heavy so heavy. my mum and my father's mother both had heavy irregular periods what i do now once they pass a week is take birth control pills to regulate it; it helps
TwoXChromosomes X You are right. My sister in law had to formula feed my nephew. Her mom died a week after his birth, and the stress led to her drying up entirely. He seems to be a healthy and happy kid now.   There seems to be a great deal of judgement from medical professionals in my area about breastfeeding. It's great that they encourage it so much (I got a free breast pump at the hospital, met with a lactation consultant every day I was there, etc.) But it seems that *because* we are given so many resources to help, they get angry at us when it doesn't work out! I've been told by multiple nurses and PAs that it's my fault for being a new parent and not "trying hard enough."  Those nurses be trippin'. 
TwoXChromosomes X I've had a great experience with Mirena. I've been using it since 2006, so I'm about a year into my second Mirena.  I was on birth control pills before getting Mirena, so I can't really comment on how Mirena compares to being truly hormone-free. But since I started using Mirena, my migraines got much less severe, I immediately lost 20 pounds, and my skin cleared up. I also don't get periods any more, which I am personally a big fan of (although I know that's a negative for many women).  There are only a couple things I don't like about my Mirena: I tend to experience very mild cramping after sex, and every once in a while I have a bit of unpredictable spotting. But they're seriously outweighed by the positives: reliable birth control that doesn't seem to have any serious side effects for me.
BabyBumps X My contractions started at 2-3 minutes apart and that was the beginning of my labor. He actually probably would have been here sooner, but I fought contractions since she wasn't here. I can't recall the length of my mother's deliveries. I don't really speak to her, but I do think each of them got faster. I'll ask my dad.  I need to ask her about what happens if I don't go into labor. She mentioned something about using castor oil if needed which I'd like to avoid for my comfort. I think the fact that I have had some contractions early already makes her think it might be quick again. It's all going to be based off how I am dilating at my appointments.   My first labor was 16.5 hours long. Water broke, contractions started 30 minutes later. I had three rounds of IV pain meds, two ITNS, and some pitocin before he was born. I was stuck to a bed the whole time. I was 0 CM dilated when I checked into the hospital at 10:30p or so and only 2 CM that morning at 7:00a.
Parenting X Thank you, he was diagnosed with torticollis and we are undergoing physiotherapy. _month_old_leans_head_to_one_side/

AskWomen X I have had a female who has IBS (as do I) describe her severe menstrual cramps as like IBS cramps in severity but lower in the abdomen. I can see how that would make someone irritable (no pun intended). It is a long, lingering pain that won't go away. But compared to a nut shot, it is a completely different kind of pain. The nut shot is like a sledge hammer, while the cramps are like getting squeezed. Getting squeezed won't kill you, but it can make you wish you were dead.
AskWomen X I would say to women:  imagine your privates as a set of lungs and you had the wind knocked out of you. Sharp pain as well as a dull ache that goes on and on and on...and you feel debilitated and can't move.  Not pleasant at all.  
BabyBumps X My understanding is that the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) is the one date in the menstrual cycle almost any woman will know for sure. Since every woman's cycle is different, ovulation could occur anywhere from 10 to 14 days from the first day of your LMP. On top of that, actual fertilization could occur within a few days of ovulation. With so many variables, it is highly unlikely that any woman knows the exact date the baby was conceived. So as a standard, they date pregnancy based on the first day of your LMP.
AskWomen X It really depends on the kind of pill you are taking. They are a lot of different kinds of homonal birth control for women : the number of pills taken, the dosage and the kind of hormones taken may vary greatly. 
AskWomen X Spend an afternoon working only on her. Don't even take your clothes off. Maybe tie her hands with to the headboard with a silk tie so that she can't brush your hands away. She sounds like she is slightly submissive in bed, so maybe what she needs is for you to take charge a little bit. Tell her that her pleasure makes your pleasure much sweeter.  Start slowly and build up. Foreplay is the key to making a woman melt in your arms. A little sensation play would probably be a good place to start, and then you can figure out what to do next by her body's cues. Remember that the body is full of erogenous zones in all sorts of unexpected places!   Orgasms don't always happen the first time, especially if she hasn't climaxed with a partner before. Sometimes the journey can be more fun than the finish line. 
beyondthebump X I'm going to be trying this all day today. I have a consistent back ache in my lower back, but it's WAY worse when I have a contraction. It's like period cramp back pain but way worse.
BabyBumps X I have a male midwife, and 4 female midwifes. There are 5 at the hospital I go to and all of them meet and care for you during your pregnancy. I feel like I have 10 hands helping me instead of 2. Also he is probably the most down to earth one, they are all really cool but I like him the most because he really gives good information and he has a very dry humor (like me). So yes, I would like a male midwife, or a female midwife, or a eunich midwife or whatever, as long as they are trained in delivering babies successfully that is who I want to deliver me :)
TwoXChromosomes X Sperm is alkaline, vaginas are acidic. Don't use any pH balancing products, because your vag has to maintain a slightly acidic pH to stay healthy. BUT, what you're talking about (smell) is normal; just wash a heck of a lot. If that doesn't help, see a doctor, because a persistent abnormal smell beyond what washing can fix *isn't* normal.
TwoXChromosomes X Add to that, and I know it's weird, but garlic cloves wrapped in cheese cloth are a natural cure for yeast infections so you could try that to restore the balance. Just make sure not to pop raw garlic up there whole :|
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Would it be possible to even establish paternity before the child is born?  Surely - genetic screening is very common during pregnancy, and while it usually takes the form of parental blood tests, you can also go for the (more invasive) amniocentesis procedure. It uses an intimidatingly large needle to sample the amniotic fluid, which contains the DNA of the fetus.
AskWomen X I don't think OP will have a problem pleasuring a woman, but I wonder what exactly he will get out of it, with all "giving" and no "receiving."  Doesn't that get unsatisfying after a while?
BabyBumps X I'll just echo everyone else and say that super fast labours are unusual.   I was in labour and knew it for at least 7 hours before I felt like I might want to go to the hospital (and when I got there I was only 4cm...sigh)  In your situation I'd plan to take a cab or have one of your birth partners drive you. You should have enough time and if you don't (things moving fast) believe me you will not care- so call an ambulance. Call up your birth partners when you are in established labour just as a heads up, but no need to head to the hospital right away. If it's night time and things are going slowly you can even wait until morning to call. If your water breaks and it's clear you can also wait until morning if things aren't moving quickly. If your water breaks and it's not clear then just prepare to go then. As for when to go to the hospital:You can follow the 4-1-1 (contractions 4 minutes apart, lasting a minute, for 1 hour or more) rule or the 3 contractions in 10 minutes or less rule.  
BabyBumps X At my hospital the rooms could hold two lairs but they tried not to double up. If they did have to put another mom in the room with you, your partner wasn't allowed to stay overnight. Luckily we didn't have to double up during our stay
TwoXChromosomes X I think most STDs are 2 weeks, but I know HIV is over 3 months. -Ask your doctor/RN/whoever does the testing -how long after is a "safe" zone for definitely all clear.   Still I recommend condoms if he is just casual. Just because he will be your only partner, doesn't mean you will be his. That's how my mom got HPV; she was monogamous, her husband was not. 
BabyBumps X I and other members on this subreddit, have successfully conceived after a miscarriage.  I miscarried in December and conceived in April!   Best of luck to you and I hope to see you here again soon!!   By the way, how far along were you when it happened?
AskWomen X You obviously know your body better than any of us do, but I have an extremely irregular period and before I was on the pill I would sometimes go for a couple months without my period... it would always show up again though.  How long has it been since your last period?  If you havent been sexual, I wouldn't worry unless it's been 2 months or more, but that's just me.
AskWomen X Ive had Mirena for approximantly 1.5 years. It has not stopped my period but it has reduced the bleeding to a very light flow/ spotting that only lasts 3 4 days at the most. i used to have very heavy bleeding and before the mirena i had bled non stop for 2 years after trying the depo shot. Since a teenager when i started my period ive had terrible cramps, the mirena really hasnt stopped those. some months are better than other though for me. Getting the Mirena was the BEST this i ever did even though i hated the insertion of it, but ill do it again in 3.5 years.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm allergic to perfume and many flowers so I just use baking soda/apple cider vinegar or a natural bar soap I get from the farmer's market. But yeah a couple weeks after being diagnosed with a thyroid disease and getting medication, my hair started growing back.   Maybe push for them to do a antibody test if you have significant reason to think you have a thyroid problem? Mine has been up and down between normal and slightly outside of normal since I was 12, so they just ignored it. It took one smart doctor to realize I had every single symptom of hypothyroidism, regardless of what my hormone levels were doing, and put me on medication. My regular GP was actually annoyed until all those symptoms went away and she conceited I had something wrong. Then I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's via the antibody test. Honestly if they did it when I was 12, maybe the following decade would have been kinder.  
AskWomen X I have Mirena, and I loooooooove it. I don't have periods per se-- just a little bit of light spotting for two days every couple months with no cramping, which used to be hugely debilitating for me. I've never had a problem with PMS (other than the occasional breakout and a little breast tenderness now and then), so I can't speak to that.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend it. A life where I don't have to even think about my period, cramps, or getting pregnant for 5 whole years?! FUCK YEAH, SIGN ME UP!!! My only regret is not getting it sooner!  **Edit:** Forgot to mention, I'm 23, never had kids, and have had mine for about a year now. May or may not be relevant information. :P
BabyBumps X Actually I think you can ask your MW or GP for a prescription. You certainly can for folic acid. I've never bothered with Elevit, always done the Blackmores (and the Apotex folic acid which is way cheaper and actually the right amount unlike everything else other than Elevit). But yeah, vitamins are still something I get sticker shock over here. 
BabyBumps X Good luck!  You'll discover pretty quickly what clothes from what store fits your baby at the right time (IE, 0-3 actually fits your 2 month old, but won't fit your 5 month old).  Old Navy and Carter's is pretty good, I find.
AskWomen X I tend to get cramps a few days before my period actually starts.  I'd give it a week before getting worried. 
BabyBumps X It went great! I love being up here, but sometimes I honestly really miss Texas:( that's something i NEVER thought i would say:P I'm really excited to be pregnant again! It's something we have been trying for a very very long time:) So happy:) 
TwoXChromosomes X From what I understand, a woman's life is more important because they can create more life.  If you kill one child to save the woman, that woman will be able to create 5 more children so you have a gain in total lives.
BabyBumps X I am! I love my belly:) It's awesome, I can feel the little one moving around when I am really still, so this is nice:) I love being pregnant, and it's my last time, so I am really loving it as much as possible. I appreciate this pregnancy, and this child. Just too super excited.   Shameless self [bump!]( )
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on the level of Spina Bifida.  It's caused by the neural tube not fusing properly - if this is just the end it can be minor, but if it's higher in the spinal cord it can be pretty catastrophic.
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds like normal breakthrough bleeding to me.   But if you're still worried about it, or have any other symptoms in the next few weeks or so, take a test. :) 
BabyBumps X It's cute, but I've been feeling them really low, like right by my bladder, which feels kinda weird sometimes.  I also tend to move my legs around because I feel like I'm squishing something I'm not supposed to be!
AskWomen X You should wait until your next period happens, and take the first pill in your pack on the first day after your period stops.  There's really nothing more to it than that, other than making sure to take your pill at the same time every day.  I set an alarm on my phone so I remember to take mine.  A common issue with women beginning oral contraceptives is that they start spotting before their week of sugar "period" pills, or their period starts early.  If this happens to you, and your cycle doesn't regulate itself after three months taking the pill regularly- talk to your doctor and they will try to find a pill with the right balance of hormones for your body.
TwoXChromosomes X Have you tried looking into IUDs? the copper version has no hormones at all, although will make your periods worse for the first 6 or so months. 
AskWomen X Look. Nobody can tell you when the right time to start having sex is, if you want to lose your virginity then that's a valid decision- don't start slut shaming yourself before anyone else does.   **Here's some things you can do to make things less painful:** Do you masturbate?  If you do, using your fingers to penetrate your vagina can help a lot to stretch out your hymen so it's less likely to tear during intercourse.  Your hymen tearing as it stretches is what causes some discomfort and the bleeding associated with losing your virginity.  Next, make sure to use lube.  It sounds like an awkward thing to do your first time, but being properly lubed up will also work wonders to keep your hymen from ripping.  Going slowly at first will help with this as well, don't let him just shove his dick in you.  Finally, RELAX.  Being nervous will cause your muscles to clench up, making your vaginal canal harder to penetrate and possibly making intercourse more painful.  **As far as making things less awkward goes**.... choose a guy you feel comfortable with, choose a time that works for you and that allows you to be able to get it on without rushing.  Sex is awesome, the more relaxed you are about it the better it will be.  If your first time is uncomfortable, know it gets better.  ***USE A CONDOM***. Enjoy your first time. Don't get pregnant.  Don't get an STD.
BabyBumps X When you get pregnant, sometimes the cervix can become incredibly sensitive.  Because of that, sex can sometimes cause very light bleeding/spotting from irritating the cervix.    To be safe, call the doctor.  No question is stupid and most doctors will want to check you out vs have an unexpected surprise.    I have not spotted at all my entire pregnancy but my cousin who had a healthy baby girl last november, spotted constantly.  Cramping like it's the first day of your period is also very common.
BabyBumps X I was scheduled to be induced in week 39 for medical reasons as well, but went into labor and ended up delivering on my scheduled induction date without the induction lol.  There's hope for you!
TwoXChromosomes X It lists 6 brand names and 15 generics. The brands include Ortho Tri Cyclen and Yasmin. I was on Yaz before. I think Yasmin is basically the same thing so I'll probably switch to that.  Edit: It also has emergency contraceptives like Plan B for free and a few choices of diaphragm (Femcap, Ortho All-Flex, Ortho-Diaphragm).
BabyBumps X As Mae said, depends on your care provider. Some want you to come in immediately, some want you to come in when you're in active labor or after having your water broken for a certain period of time.  How long your baby can stay in with your water broken also varies from provider to provider. Some really want your baby out at a certain hour, others are fine to let you go longer as long as there are no signs of infection and you and your baby are stable and you're making progress.  Your provider will likely remind you when they'd like to see you/hear from you closer to 36 weeks. But you can always bring it up at your next visit to get clarification.
TwoXChromosomes X If they're "pro life" they should know that making contraceptives free of charge will result in less unwanted pregnancies and hence, less abortions. Isn't that what they want?
TwoXChromosomes X It's not the name that's fancy for Nuvaring, it's the delivery system. There is no generic for Nuvaring. It's also likely that the formulation of the hormones is also different. If it were the same, what would stop you from using one of the lower tier options?
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not gonna lie, the insertion was the worst paint I've ever felt. But after the first few months, everything starts to regulate, and NO MORE PERIODS SO AWESOME. I haven't felt this normal and balanced EVER. I was on bc pills for 6 years before I just stopped taking them. I just got my Mirena in January. 
BabyBumps X My first bump pic!!! :) a day shy of 23 weeks. There's finally more bump than fluff starting to show! 
BabyBumps X Why thank you! I feel huge and gained more than 50 lbs. :/ But I guess I'm carrying it well. :)
BabyBumps X I've had similar since yesterday, but I've been chalking it up to the wee Goat stretching out in several directions at once.... It feels like baby is pushing from the inside, and also trying to stretch my cervix out of shape. At least the little bugger is moving a bunch! 
BabyBumps X YES to ultrasounds being off on measurements.  I've had a few friends that got "sizing ultrasounds" and were expecting gigantor babies then ended up with 7 pounders.  It can go the other way too of course, but more often than not your body will not grow a baby bigger than it can handle, assuming you don't have gestational diabetes or something that would cause abnormal growth.  It would just be a shame to get an unwanted c-section based on an ultrasound and then end up with a smaller than expected baby that would have easily been birthed vaginally.
BabyBumps X Thank you SO MUCH for posting this. It could have been written by me. I've felt nauseated during the entire pregnancy so far, and yesterday I got a stomach virus and vomited a ton. And today I feel fine. No morning sickness, no cravings. I was worrying about it and these replies all helped me too.
BabyBumps X Mine broke at home and they told me to come in right away. I was told in a birthing class that I would have 24 hours to have him but they only allowed me 18! So I ended up with A LOT of pitocin. Fun stuff really. :/ And I was still in labor for 19 hours so he still had to have antibiotics.
TwoXChromosomes X As well.    It can be quite enjoyable for your partner too.  Sometimes just the squeezing is enough to bring my husband to orgasm.  It's like a secret vagina superpower.
BabyBumps X I always think I'm bigger than I am and spent 2nd trimester asking my husband about my bump, he always said it wasn't that obvious. I wanted it to be obvious so was always bummed out.  I think it's two things: as someone else said, you know your body better than anyone else and will immediately notice any and all changes. Also, you probably look at your tum with your top off or pulling your top tight. Never underestimate how much clothes disguise our bellies. At 28 weeks my husband would say I didn't look that pregnant but that's cos I was wearing his massive t-shirts for comfort.  
AskWomen X My boyfriend is very large and often hits my cervix and as everyone has said it hurts. You should also be aware though that if you are hitting her cervix because you are too large, you run the risk of fracture. My boyfriend's doctor warned him about this, so as soon as he hits my cervix we switch positions. One position that I enjoy that reduces the depth of penetration is placing your legs outside of her's in a missionary position. 
BabyBumps X First off, they won't know how big your baby is until she comes out! An hour before I delivered my son, they estimated him 2.5 pounds bigger than he was! Second, it is very possible that a baby be too big to deliver. They told me if mine was a bit larger, I couldn't have had him naturally. I pushed for 1.5 hours, active labor with induction for 22 hours, and passive labor for 2.5 weeks! - and he was still only 6lbs 4oz! And I have larger hips, so it surprised me to hear that! I say go for the vaginal delivery. If they need to do a C-section, they will! Good luck!
BabyBumps X Yeah, mine likes to kick me in the vagina and then flip around and kick me super high.  I feel for you for sure!  *hugs* 
TwoXChromosomes X Personally, I would be careful if you plan on cutting up your birth control pills. I know that the pills are specifically designed so that the hormones and the effects of these hormones last in your body for 24 hours. My guess is that you would have break through bleeding and that the pill would not fully protect you from getting pregnant (I'm no expert though!) I would talk to your doctor or at least a pharmacist before cutting them up.   Also: I'm on Aviane (non-brand version of Alesse) and it is very low hormone and I have had no weight gain or mood swings from it so you might wanna give it a try. Or maybe ask your doc about the mini pill?
BabyBumps X Aww I'm waiting to pop :( 24 weeks today so I'm noticeably pregnant rather than fat, but I really want a big round bump already!
AskWomen X That's actually a very real possibility. With PCOS (which I also have) some women have symptoms of abnormal facial hair and/or thinning hair on their scalp due to the way your hormones get messed up. The right birth control can regulate your hormones better, basically giving you more "normal" levels. However because of the PCOS, being overweight can exacerbate this symptom even if you aren't obese. Aside from shedding a few pounds (if you are indeed overweight), you should probably see your doctor again.      If you do decide to go back to the doctor, make sure it's someone who's very experienced at treating patients with PCOS. I was very lucky to find a gyno whose sub-specialty is reproductive endocrinology, so she's well versed in pretty much every treatment option. Maybe taking just progesterone and trying some metformin could help? 
BabyBumps X Aw, my daughter had jaundice too at first. It was really tough in the beginning, but she's perfectly fine now. Just a head's up, the jaundice may make it tough to breastfeed, for some reason babies just have a harder time when they have jaundice. Hang in there, once the jaundice clears up, the breastfeeding gets easier. 
beyondthebump X Just shy of 11 pounds (I'm 5'6" and was 120 lbs pre-pregnancy) and gave birth last December. 
TwoXChromosomes X So you're able to read an (unsourced) definition, but not the OPs post? You're also not able to tell the difference between being "uncomfortable" and an "uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical behavior of a sexual nature especially by a person in authority toward a subordinate (as an employee or student)"?
BabyBumps X I've got an appointment on Thursday, just another appointment closer to anti-d day at 28 weeks! :(
beyondthebump X I also had hyperemesis (but throughout the whole pregnancy) and it almost feels like muscle memory for some things to make me gag still (also the smell of meats for me!), and I definitely still wake up nauseous some days.  It's definitely rare that it happens, but it actually seems to be when my stomach is super empty!  I definitely think it's because I spent 9 months nauseous and throwing up every day, it was the norm for a long time, it probably just takes some time for our bodies to go back to actual normality.
beyondthebump X At 10cm with only a "lip" of cervix left.  Midwife was holding up the lip while I tried to push to get his head over it.  She had almost just finished saying she could break my water to get things going a bit faster, but it would probably make contractions more painful for me.  I hadn't decided what I wanted her to do when out came the thickly meconium stained amniotic fluid!  And we headed to the hospital... and that's just part of the story that ended up working out like it seemed it should have...
BabyBumps X I was induced with my first but refused any pain medication. I was dead set on being as natural as possible (induced at 41w+5). I won't lie, it was painful, and the doctor kept having me move from side to side, I ended up giving birth to her on my left side with my stepsister holding my leg (I pissed on her :D).  My main reasons for natural birth with that one and this upcoming one are mostly just because any medications you take, go to your baby as well. Anything that makes you groggy can make her groggy as well. Plus our bodies are made to handle child birth without medicine. I'm not anti-medicine by any means. I just think that it's better in the end to put the least amount of toxic things in your body when you're pregnant.
AskWomen X I personally don't enjoy sex that goes on and on -- I enjoy sex, but not for more than 20 minutes. I do enjoy making my fellow cum, however, so I think I'd feel rather unsatisfied with you. But hey, everyone's different and I do believe there are some women who would love that kind of sex. 
TwoXChromosomes X That's what came to mind for me too. Isn't it usually accompanied by a fever for the initial outbreak? If it is herpes though, then there's not a lot you can do about it. I would advise not sleeping with anyone whilst you have these lesions though. I don't think that everyone who is a carrier has symptoms, so if it is herpes then the OP's boyf may have it too.
TwoXChromosomes X I am trying disposable cups first once I'm out of tampons to ease into the cup idea. Like... Does anyone else push/kind of displace the tampon while you're pooping with the period shits? Nothing like trying to jam it back up there D:
TwoXChromosomes X It just isn't sexual, it's not sexual unless he touches her or says something sexual to her. Sexual harassment is bullying or intimidation of a sexual nature, not "at the root" but actual sexual nature, or unwelcome sexual advancements, such as being touched or being talked to like "I love your tits" or "Your chest looks amazing in that shirt" or "could you get that pencil I dropped over there *wink wink*". NOT "Don't talk to her, I like her" 
TwoXChromosomes X Pap smears are for cervical cancer checks. With a total hysterectomy you don't have a cervix. So no need for a pap smear  At least, that's what my MIL is told. She doesn't need pap smears since she has no cervix 
BabyBumps X I'm hoping so as well. Talked to my baby daddy's mum and she said that if things don't change I will have a "back labor" birth. Which from what I understand is especially painful (I'm planning on an all natural birth).
BabyBumps X i completely agree. i'm hoping for a vbac with my next kiddo but just the prospect of uterine rupture scares me enough that i would never attempt it at home without any medical support. hell, the day i was induced another woman was rushed to the OR with a uterine rupture.
BabyBumps X Lucky! After delivery doc said no sex at all until 6 weeks and when I was 32 weeks pregnant I went into early labor and at that point was told no sex until 37 weeks...my little man was born at 37w1day so...haven't had sex in a while! It sucks!
TwoXChromosomes X If it's only your third month on the pill then your body is still adjusting to them.  Some women go on the pill and immediately have regular cycles; for others it takes a little longer for your hormones and things to straighten out.  I don't know that I'd consider you 'late' just yet--try not to stress and if it doesn't come within the next 2 days or so, take a test and ease your mind.  
BabyBumps X I'm little and with my daughter I didn't show and didn't show and then BAM at like 7/8 months I was huge.  Everyone is different and so is every pregnancy. 
TwoXChromosomes X you can use apple cider vinegar mixed 1:1 with water and apply to the area before sleeping.  If it's a yeast infection, it should go away within 1-3 days with this treatment. or you can get monistat 3 from the drug store and it will cure it.  are you sure it's not an std?
TwoXChromosomes X The breasts quickly adjust to making too much milk like I said and the problem is passing and usually easily dealt with. Make sure that the breast is completely empty before switching to the other one. 
BabyBumps X I had morning sickness from 9 to 15 weeks every day all day. including headaches, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, heartburn, and all around discomfort. from 15 to 17 it was off and on. by 18 was pretty much non existent. granted I have bad days of acid, heartburn, uncontrollable hunger, overheating, or light headedness its a lot more tolerable since its not all the time. At 21 weeks now and since I can now feel her kicking that makes a huge difference as I can finally feel the reason why its all worth it moving around. Everyones different though but chances are you'll be fine in a few weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X I had one a few years ago and I did actually agonize over what decision to make. I don't think about it often, but when I do think about it I am sad for the loss of a potential child. I wonder what the child would have been like etc. But it is not something that I always think about. Usually only once or twice a year.   I thought during my decision making process that I would deeply regret my decision later in life, but I don't. I am glad that I had the option available. I already had one child that I was struggling to take care of whose father was in and out of the picture. I got pregnant with the same guy and knew I was headed towards a whole world of shit.  I don't know what my life would be like had I not had my abortion, but I can bet it wouldn't have been good.
TwoXChromosomes X Are you drinking enough water? Sometimes if my pee is too concentrated, it irritates me. Your urine should be almost clear. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had an abortion, and I do regret it. I think about it constantly. I wonder what life would be like if I'd kept it.   **It was still absolutely the right choice.**   I know what you're trying to do here, and I think it's important that women not be shamed or scared away from abortion. But when I had those feelings of regret after my abortion, I worried that there was something wrong with me FOR regretting it. I'd always discounted the stories of regret as being anti-abortion propaganda, and that left me unprepared to deal with my own emotions after.   My point is to please remember that there is no "right way" to feel after an abortion. You are right to not be ashamed, but it's also important not to portray your experience as the norm, just as much as it's wrong of others to portray feelings of regret as the norm. 
BabyBumps X Woo! We're almost due date buddies. :) I'm due the 26th apparently. :D wonder how our puppy will take the new fragile baby...
TwoXChromosomes X I would say the majority of abortions happen because no form of birth control was used.  Edit:  &gt;Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. **Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently,** while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.  [Source]( _induced_abortion.pdf)  So what this means is that 46% of women who had an abortion didn't use any form of contraception at all the month they got pregnant and out of the 54% who do use it the vast majority used it inconsistently thus making the majority of abortions that occur a result of human error (aka nothing standing between the egg and the sperm) not BC failing. Only using a condom some of the times or taking BC not as prescribed doesn't count as BC failing. 
BabyBumps X Aww good for you! I'm 22weeks and my SO can't not only feel the kicks but can see my tummy move when baby kicks.. It's frikkin awesome! !!
TwoXChromosomes X One of the arguments against abortion is that people use it as birth control instead of being responsible and having protected sex. Mocchan is perpetuating that stereotype. FYI, you can have protected sex without having to be on hormonal birth control- there are condoms, copper IUD's, spermicidal jellies/sponges/diaphragms (though the last three do have higher failure rates than I personally am comfortable with).  
TwoXChromosomes X That's not what those statistics show though. I know people here have very strong beliefs about this but don't let your beliefs cloud your rational judgement.   Rape and incest combined account for just 1% of all abortions [Source]( -and-incest-just-1-of-all-abortions.html). According to the statistics the vast majority of abortions are either due to no contraception being used at all or contraception being used inconsistently (aka on and off) and that's a fact.   Yes not being able to afford or not having access to emergency contraception is a legitimate concern but that doesn't override the fact that most people who have abortions did not use contraception when having sex to begin with or used it inconsistently hoping they'll get lucky and the responsibility for that is on them. They most likely wouldn't have gotten pregnant and wouldn't need plan B if they used contraception to begin with but they chose to have irresponsible sex instead. 
TwoXChromosomes X See, but that *doesn't* make sense. Why aren't these girls learning what feels pleasurable through masturbation and other forms of partnered play before they get to putting a penis in them. 
BabyBumps X My mom was really distressed when I told her that I don't plan to circumcise my son, one of the reasons being "cleanliness" and the fact that I'd have to "pull his skin back and clean it everyday".   I'm glad that awareness is starting to spread!   I find it so silly when people ask "don't you want him to be normal?" Cutting off bits of a baby boy's penis is almost done entirely for vanity or falsified "health issues" in the U.S. today and it's very rare than someone NEEDS a circumcision.  
BabyBumps X You are absolutely right!  But so much can go wrong. My boy was in the NICU for a week and I feel most moms would have given up on BFing in my situation. He self weaned at 7 months :) It takes determination, but the benefits are well worth it! I understand why so much lactation support is needed. Its so easy to just give up :( 
BabyBumps X i feel like ultimately, whether or not it's hard depends on the issues you have and your perspective. i never had any latching or supply issues, but nursing did still hurt a little for the first couple of weeks, only at the beginning of each feed (like 30-60 seconds). it was like getting a hickey. and it can be time-consuming, especially during growth spurts when baby is cluster-feeding. i don't think i could've made it 7 months if i'd had to work. but the reason i *have* made it 7 months is because i found it to be so easy. i think every mother should at least attempt breastfeeding, because you can always switch to formula if it doesn't work but you can't switch from formula to breastfeeding. ;)
BabyBumps X I was gonna say, if you were going to a regular OB, then tomorrow could be your lucky day. A lot of times they'll strip your membranes to get labor kick started ;-)
TwoXChromosomes X My best friend is on Depo Provera (the shot) and hasn't had her period in three years. There are potential side effects (like any birth control), but she loves it.
BabyBumps X My husband is a supportive man and he's going to be a great father. However, I was disappointed with his (lack of) reaction to our first ultrasound. I stewed on it for a day and then I just broke down (hooray for hormones!) and cried in front of him. We talked about it and he's gone out of his way to be there with me a little more. He still isn't excited about the same things I'm excited about or in the same way, but now know I'm not alone. Have you tried telling him that you're feeling alone?  Also, you are so not alone. We're always here for fears, rants, complaints, joys, food cravings, etc.
BabyBumps X I *was* hoping for a Halloween baby but then I found out my favourite band are coming to my city on the 1st November so I'm hoping I at least last until my due date now coz my mom got us tickets!!!  I'm having a boy :) Dexter! Do you know?
TwoXChromosomes X I have had WAY less of these accidents since I got my divacup. The risk of TSS is much lower with it because it's non porous and non absorbent, so I can put it in a day or two before I'm expecting my period and check it every 8-12 hrs just in case, and I can leave it in the day or two after my period to catch any of those random heavy bleeds that can pop up just when you think it's over without worrying about it drying out my vagina like the Sahara. 
BabyBumps X In my case it was my dad calling me while I was drunk having a poker game and asking randomly if I was pregnant that made me test. I felt like a terrible person. My period was never regular and I always have weird symptoms with my period, so I never thought I could be pregnant...
TwoXChromosomes X Well, after all my research I think I'm going to go with Lo Loestrin if my current pill doesn't work out. It has the highest amount of progestin of any other method I looked up (even more than Depo, but this one doesn't kill estrogen production, it just overpowers it), and the progestin in Lo Loestrin is extremely potent as well. Coupled with only 10 micrograms of estrogen, that's probably why bleeding is so scant. Apri has 30 micrograms, same as I'm on now, so keep my updated on how things go with it! c:
TwoXChromosomes X This sounds exactly like something I recently got over, and have had to deal with before. Right down to the clitoris pain, though mine wasn't as intense as yours sounds. It started right around the very end of my last period and lasted for a few days after that. I have never seen a doctor for it, but I believe what you have is vaginitis, an infection that causes inflammation, itchiness and irritation, discharge, and a foul odor.  Here's what I do when this happens to me: I try to leave my genitals alone as much as possible (I'm not a virgin, so it means no sexytimes with the boyfriend for a while), I don't wear underwear to keep things nice and aired out, and I clean the entire area very, very well with just plain water when I shower. It clears up on its own after a bit.  Good luck, and try to take it easy. Don't put anything else on the area, at least for a while. Don't want to make things worse.
TwoXChromosomes X So you can't get an abortion if the doctor is a man? Also, by saying that law doesn't belong in a uterus I think she is saying that other people shouldn't be able to tell her what to be able to do with it, but that is tricky because she implies that abortion shouldn't be regulated. It is a careful procedure and extremely dangerous when done by the wrong person so it obviously should be regulated. So, as much as laws pertain to our bodies I don't think the uterus should be excluded. It needs protection as well. 
BabyBumps X I was having terrible terrible hip pain, I could barely get out of bed or walk, or put my pants on :c But one time as I was getting out of the car, I swung my leg out pretty quickly and heard the biggest POP! sound. After that, my hips were okay again(: May not be too much help, but maybe a good pop is all you need?
TwoXChromosomes X Having an irregular cycle doesn't mean you can't do fertility monitoring...How irregular is it?  If it is abnormally irregular (your cycles are regularly longer than 38 days or less than 23) have you had seen a doctor to determine a reason?  If you can't use HBC or get an IUD then your options are fertility monitoring and barrier methods.  Even with fertility monitoring, you will either have to abstain or use barrier methods during your fertile period, and I know I certainly am not going to abstain for 10-14 days a month, so barrier methods are basically a necessity.  Using two barrier methods you can have VERY reliable contraception.  From [scarleteen]( _buddy_system_effectiveness_rates_for_backing_up_your_birth_control_with_a_s):  - Male condom + cervical barrier: 99.88% effective perfect use - 97.9% effective with typical use  - Male condom + withdrawal: Male Condoms + Withdrawal = 99.92% effective with perfect use - 95.95% effective with typical use  - Cervical barrier + withdrawal: 99.76% effective with perfect use - 96.22% effective with typical use  Compare this to the rates of these three methods on their own:  - Male condom: 98% effective alone with perfect use - 85% effective alone with typical use  - Cervical barrier: 94% effective alone with perfect use - 86% effective alone with typical use  - Withdrawal: 96% effective with perfect use - 73% effective with typical use  Compare this to, say, the birth control pill on its own:  - 99.7% effective alone with perfect use - 92% effective alone with typical use  And you'll see that combining two barrier methods is actually MORE effective (statistically) than using the pill on its own.  While I do recommend tracking your cycles, during your fertile time (or all the time if you do not know your fertile time and are not on HBC and do not have an IUD) it is best to use two methods.  However, if you track your fertility you can use 2 methods when you are fertile, and then when you are not you can use 1 or none, depending on your comfort level.  Personally I am comforting using 2 methods when I am fertile and not using any when I am not, but others who want more protection (which sounds more suitable for you) can use 1 when they are infertile.  If you are interested in cervical barriers, I highly recommend the femcap, which is available with prescription in the US and without prescription in Canada and I believe Europe.  I recommend using it combined with contragel green (available online), a lactic acid spermicide that is odorless, tasteless, and side-effect free, as opposed to typical nonoxyl-9 spermicides that can cause nasty side effects and taste horrible.
TwoXChromosomes X As a thought exercise, between removal and termination versus simply removal, do you have justification for the former? I think we agree a man can't rape you, but if you revoke consent during sex do you also have the right to castrate him? A dying patient can't steal your blood/organs, but are you justified in destroying the organs other organs to ensure he can't make use of yours? My issue with your analogy is that you blur the line between the right to remove the unwanted organism and your right to terminate it on principle. If it were a person, the meaning of abortion would have to disassociate from termination. You should not be allowed to destroy people when other options that cause you no harm do exist. Your rights end where theirs begin. 
TwoXChromosomes X Even with all the science in the universe, at that point it would require an artificial womb, so I would still say it's a fetus. What if, ( assuming we live in magic science land) a woman were to miscarry at 15 weeks, would she be required by law to provide the medical attention needed to sustain the life? What if it's expensive? I mean essentially my womb is a life support chamber, so who decides who gets to pull the plug? I would say the owner of the womb. It's not like I can get pregnant with my husband's fetus while a rapist's fetus is taking up the space. I believe my womb is infinitely more precious than an individual hypothetical fetus.
BabyBumps X I wish there were something that could be done... I've got a very strong active baby as well. I'm at the very last few days, if that, of my pregnancy and my entire stomach feels bruised from baby's movement.  I just have to look at the bright side... no need for kick counts and I don't worry about baby's well being because they're always. freaking. moving.
BabyBumps X Only in the movies!   But seriously: Not always. Membrane rupture happens because of many things, but sometimes they'll rupture and there aren't enough prostaglandins to get labor going, or keep it going. Water can break way too early on in pregnancy without the onset of labor (PPROM: in which case, you're gonna have a bad time). It's a good thing to have that sac intact as long as possible, both for protection against infection and comfort of the laboring woman. Also for avoiding really rare stuff like cord prolapse, etc. [More]( _of_membranes)
TwoXChromosomes X The pain and I feel like I start contorting myself into the weirdest positions   to reach certain areas lol. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think you understand.  I don't want to loose weight.  I have a very nice shape except for this little pooch around my belly button.  It looks like two of these ( ) around my belly button.   
BabyBumps X Good luck. I hope you start contractions soon. My water broke and I never started contractions and had to be induced at 39w 5d. This made my contractions much more painful for me, unfortunately. Also I chose not to take medications initially but gave up after about 10 hours painful labor and only 3cm dialation and got an epidural. Then gave birth within 1.5 hrs of that.  Keep us updated!
beyondthebump X My sister in law is pregnant with her second. Her first was born at 36 weeks and over 10 pounds (she also had uncontrolled diabetes)  This time, her diabetes is under control and she's... I'd have to guess 34 weeks now... and not currently having issues with pre-e.  Yet here I am on #4 and 41 weeks along... and for the first time ever I have to worry about it.
TwoXChromosomes X It's murder.   The difference is choice number 1, that's her body, her potential child, her choice. You took a life from her.   Second, it's intent, your intent was to destroy the fetus growing inside someone else. Her intent was to kill herself.   Lastly, the potential trauma caused to the pregnant woman wouldn't be any different if you had done this after birth. 
TwoXChromosomes X Don't get me wrong, I totally agree with the sentiment "my body parts belong to me", but the argument of whether developing embryos are considered life, and whether or not right to life supersedes the right to bodily autonomy is totally a political opinion even if the answer is obvious in your (our) eyes. 
BabyBumps X If they start getting a lot stronger or very uncomfortable where you can barely talk through them I would head to the hospital. Sometimes contractions come in funky intervals. Or it could just be your body getting ready for the big day, or a very long "early labor".... it's hard to say =( At this point you just need to wait it out. *fingers crossed it's the real thing!* 
BabyBumps X Oh my! I know that feeling. I was like 2 days overdue, in labor for 2 days, might I add...and finally was like fuck this! I'm not going back to the hospital til I feel like my back is gonna break!! Good luck girl! Children are little miracles! 
TwoXChromosomes X The clinic I go to recently made it a policy where they don't do pap smears or even use the metal duck on women under 21 years old. I don't know how universal this is (I think they did this to help young women come and get birth control without being scared away by the exam, as it is a birth control clinic, not a typical ob/gyn).  Also, one thing I always forget is that after they take the metal duck out, they usually stick two fingers up there and one hand on top to feel for bumps or something. It always freaks me out for a second, but it's over quickly!
BabyBumps X Both goodwill and children's resale shops usually have some great deals! I got some nice shorts for $4 at good will that are being sold at motherhood for $30! Try Craigslist and garage sales too!!!
TwoXChromosomes X 1. No, but if you do, that's fine too. They are there to make sure you're healthy and don't GAF. If you want some extra peace of mind you could always take a travel pack of baby wipes to do a last minute pre-tidy in the bathroom there before you are called. (Same for getting waxed.)  2. The PAP is a little uncomfy, and the whole thing's kind of awkward, but truly, NBD. Your butt will never be scooted down the edge of the table enough, so be ready to scoot it further :P  3. In goes the [speculum]( -medical.com/product_images/uploaded_images/vaginal-speculum-examination-diagram.jpg) probably with a little bit of KY lube, they open it up which will feel a bit stretched, there's some feeling from both the inside and outside above your pubic bone, the the PAP, which is my least favorite part, but it'll be fast.  4. It might very slightly during the PAP, but like I said, it's fast. And no, pretty darn doubtful there will be any turn-on &lt;:D ou. 5. Docs approve you have questions - that tells 'em you're engaged in your health. Ask the doc (or RN) anything you want about sexual health matters and they will be happy to educate you &amp; help you figure out the best plan for your contraception. Nope, the doc is not going to blab to anybody.  Don't worry - it's truly not terrible :)  
TwoXChromosomes X 1.) Nope, not at all.  First lady exam I had, I was in full winter hibernation mode, and it didn't phase her a bit.  Actually, I don't think much of anything can phase a gyno.  2.) and 3.) Not really.  At 17, there will be no pap.  The doc will feel up your breasts looking for any lumps and put a finger in your vagina to check for cysts.  Since you're not sexually active, there probably won't be any STI tests, so you're set.  If, like my doc, they have a policy of doing them on anyone over the age of 15, it's a quick swab of the inside of your vagina.  No pain or pinch or anything.  4.) It doesn't hurt.  It's awkward as all get-out, but it's not painful, and if anything hurts, you should tell the doctor so they stop hurting you.  5.) Yes, the doctor can tell you that, but no, they can't tell your mother that.  Also remember that your hymen not being intact has little to do with being a virgin.  Tampons and sports can "break" it for one, and hymens aren't exactly a membrane all across the vagina.  It's basically a little circle of tissue around the opening, and at some point you will or have stretch or tear it, not always through sex.  Even if you aren't a virgin, the doctor cannot tell your parents.  However, if you are on their insurance and have any sort of STI screening, they will see that in the statement.  But if your doc does it as a standard procedure with everyone your age, you can explain that to your parents and have them call the doctor's office if they make a big deal about it.
TwoXChromosomes X If it hurts, it's likely infected.  A dermatologist can inject an anti-inflammatory into it.  The swelling will go down that day, it may drain a tiny bit, but that usually fixes the problem quickly without recurrence.  Be careful with triple-antibiotic cream near your nethers, it can encourage yeast infections.
TwoXChromosomes X Ultrasounds are often to get a better look at cysts that you might have, that they can feel for first during the exam. In the US, I've only had an ultrasound offered because my gynecologist something during the exam, which she felt for by pressing on the outside of my pelvic area. So they might only be offered or recommended in the US after the doctor feels something that warrants a, ah *"closer view."*
TwoXChromosomes X That was the most comprehensive summary I can think of. The Dumb Duck comment made me laugh.  Two things to add though. Everyone is different, the first time I went the speculum my (now former) doctor used was too big and despite my yelling "ow ow ow OOWWWW" she kept trying it a few times. Speak up, if it hurts let your doctor know. 12 years of having exams later and quite frankly the speculum is still a very uncomfortable experience for me. It helps to relax all the muscles in your bum and lower abdomen. Your doctor should tell you to do that to help.  Also, I have never not had the doctor give a breast exam as well, this is why the gown needs to open in the front. Since it is your first exam your doctor should also explain how to give yourself breast exams and when is the best time (usually monthly while in the shower and when you do not have your period as during your period your breasts can feel different).  I second the comment to bring socks but also bring a maxi pad. They use quite a bit of lubricant and a tampon won't really absorb it (not to be gross or anything... but you will want one).  Feel free to ask your doctor ANYTHING. They have heard it all before and particularly if you do go on the pill bring up any questions or concerns. Also, finding the right pill can be a process, if one doesn't work for you make sure you can call your doctor to try something else.  
TwoXChromosomes X How much maternity leave should a woman have when she has a baby? Should she work through that leave? She is setting a bad example for women by working through that leave. That is a bad example she is setting. Women should have months and months off to care for baby, not the scant weeks that the CEO is going to take. 
TwoXChromosomes X This is true! However, there is a difference between handing someone an invitation and touching or repeated requests for sex. If handing someone (of age) a sexual invitation and not bothering them further is considered sexual harassment, maybe we are too prudish for our own good.
BabyBumps X I got a horrible cold in my first trimester and every time I sneezed I would pee it was awful.  Now I also get the "I'm going to pee myself" urgent feeling every time I stand up and I don't see at all how I could pee anymore then I already am.  I feel lucky if I make it a hour at this point and I am so happy to hear that other women are going through the same thing.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; If handing someone (of age) a sexual invitation and not bothering them further is considered sexual harassment, maybe we are too prudish for our own good.  More. The response, of disgust at your once off invitation to sex, counts as a sexual harassment. It is a harassment of you in virtue of a (morally permissible) expression of your sexuality.
beyondthebump X I went into labor at 35 weeks, thought it was a combo of gas pains and braxton hicks, as it couldn't possibly be labor pains. was laboring for about a day before I called the doctor since I puked the day before and it had been 24 hours, and you're supposed to call after that. Went into triage, they couldn't tell if it was real labor or prodromal, gave me fluids for dehydration. Checked me before letting me go, was 90% effaced, fingertip dilated. Went in for '23 hour observation'. Water broke, then I knew I was having baby within 24 hours. Had baby 90 minutes later.  That's right, I only knew I was really in labor for less than two hours. And it was my first baby too...  You can totally tell the difference between an engaged baby and not, too. Kept feeling 'pressure on my cervix'.
beyondthebump X I was put on bed rest at ~34.5 weeks for contractions that were a little too productive. So, I assumed, after going off bedrest at 37 and continuing contractions (some painful, some show later, several other 'symptoms'), that I would be having the baby soon...Then the due date come and went. I ended up going to the hospital two days after he was due because something just didn't feel right. Turns out, I was correct, his heart rate was regularly decreasing with major contractions. They monitored me and we ended up inducing, at least no emergency c-section was needed. 
TwoXChromosomes X I think you need to need to hit it a little harder then. For such a strong infection you should be using a 6 day pessary along with canestan cream for your external bits. Double whammy it. Also the cream helps soothe the itchy pain.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;You could think about adoption but I would strongly reconsider.  Why should she reconsider thinking about adoption? It's not for everyone, but if she can't go through with the abortion and can't reasonably raise two more kids, it seems like a reasonable thing to do.
BabyBumps X My midwives have been measuring my bump at every appointment.  It's been pretty spot on except for one time he had a growth spurt and measured ahead.  He's back on track now.
BabyBumps X I'm glad they were able to find a heartbeat!  I had some bright red bleeding at 17 weeks. I of course lost my shit, called the on-call doctor, went to the ER... all that stuff. They did an ultrasound and had me stay overnight. The reason for the bleeding was that my low lying placenta/placenta previa (which had been diagnosed at 13 weeks) was moving and there was a small bleed that happened.  Fortunately, the placenta previa resolved itself and everything is going great now!  I hope you get some good news tomorrow.
beyondthebump X What happened that made them do an emergency caesar? Glad you little lass is healthy!  It's funny, I'm not one of those mother earthy types - I trust in western medicine and have faith in my doctors. But there is something about being pregnant that makes you so finely tuned to your body, so in touch with all the changes.   And something just twigged this week. I've had a fairly miserable pregnancy, I've been exhausted and experienced nausea the entire time. I've also felt a bit anxious and worried (even though the little lad has been nothing but healthy). And then suddenly two days ago, a sense of calm has overtaken me. It might just be because I know I'm now at full term, but it feels like more than that. I just feel ready and have lost the anxiety.
BabyBump X ! I normally have a flat stomach so its weird for me to look down and see a bump. Even if it is tiny. Yay for the new bumps on babybumps! 
BabyBumps X That happened to me when I was pregnant with my son! I went to the hospital just to have it checked out, and it turns out that I had just peed my pants. Oops. I did go into labor the next day, so I think them poking around in there got something going. He was 2 weeks late though, so maybe it was just a coincidence. Hang in there ladies, those babies will come out when they are good and ready. I know it's miserable, but at least you're still getting some sleep! (Hopefully) :)
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, but if the mother keeps the child, she might decide to keep it for herself when abortion is no longer an option.
BabyBumps X I got to hear heartbeat at 10 weeks, though it took some searching and afterwards they told me it might not have been possible at 10 weeks. Wish they had told me before, I sat there the whole time certain the baby was gone! Good luck at your August appt!
TwoXChromosomes X Listen to your doctors.  If you have a family history of blood clots - you do - then avoid *estrogen*, not all birth control.    There are plenty of options that don't increase blood clot risk, like the minipill.  A lot of women are intolerant to external estrogen, like that in the pill, so they're put on progesterin-only methods like the minipill, the depo shot, the implant, and copper IUDs.  I'm estrogen intolerant.  I'm also on the minipill for contraception.  Realize that you *do* have options.   Also, while it's entirely *possible* that your mom suddenly had several large clots after a month of pill use?  I doubt that's what *caused* the clots.  Made them worse?  Sure!  But created them within *a month* is an extremely unlikely scenario.  She likely already had some floating around, so to speak, and the estrogen introduced into her system made everything spiral out of control.  
Parenting X There is something entirely different about a boy, just as there is about a girl. My son is so beyond different from the way my daughters, sisters, and female cousins are. At first I was worried about having a boy (all I knew were girls!), but he is truly my Momma's Boy. 
BabyBumps X I was checked during my group step B test last pregnancy (and the doctor asked me) and then again at my 40 week appointment. But you say you don't want to, it's not something they need to do-- most women are just curious and want to know =) 
BabyBumps X My advice for us fast growing mommas: It might not prevent stretch marks (medically, there is no preventing them, it's genetic), but you can help them be not as intense! Put coco butter or vitamin B oil or coconut oil on your belly. If your belly is itchy, it's stretching, lube it up! I'm a tiger momma because of how fast I grew and I didn't put that much of anything on my belly. It really helps the skin be more elasticy.
BabyBumps X This happened to me at 8 weeks, the bleeding lasted for about 2 days and I had some cramping too so I was really scared. I had a scan and everything was ok and they had no idea why it happened either. I'll keep my fingers crossed everything is ok for you, I think it really does seem normal to bleed early in pregnancy which doesn't help when it happens but makes you feel a bit more sane when you realise its happened to other people too
BabyBumps X Have you had sex recently? Then yep, you could be pregnant. Those symptoms you describe can be early pregnancy symptoms or signs of your forthcoming period. Isn't mother nature fun?  Can you get your hands on a home pregnancy test? That'll start you in the right direction.  Good luck, and I hope you get the result you want!
BabyBumps X Yup.  I feel so sore some days.  Right around 18-25 weeks was the worst, its much better now.  Hurt to sit sometimes!  I thought it was increased blood blood flow to the area making everything sore. My ligament pain is only in my uterus.  Did you get the same pain during your period before?  I usually had it during that time though not as intense.  Feels bruised, man.
TwoXChromosomes X depo was a nightmare for me too.  depo was a treatment option that my OB and I ruled out right off the bat. I had two depo shots last year and bled continuously for 7 months with heavy, painful, clotty periods every 3 weeks. I had awful mood swings and felt out of control. I hated that there was nothing that could be done to get it out of my system.
AskWomen X I would try a flavored lubricant that's specifically made to go inside your vagina. Googling flavoured lubricant yielded [this]( -sex-gels.html?gclid=CJvg9qTmq7ECFUXc4AodeU4AGg) result. Good luck sugar-coating your hooch!
TwoXChromosomes X If it's a bacterial infection, and you've been treated and its recurring, I think it might be possible for your partner to have it and keep reinfecting you?  Not a diagnosis, just throwing it out there as a possibility.  If that's the case, he should get treated too.
TwoXChromosomes X This is really common - B.V. (bacterial vaginosis) thrives in the conditions that are often created when killing off a yeast infection, and is often a secondary infection to yeast. This may address why you're having them back-to-back.  One reason why you could be getting them - and why I've gotten them over and over in the past, is because you and your partner (who remains asymptomatic) are passing it back and forth between the two of you.  Diet can also encourage yeast/B.V. infections - a diet with heavy amounts of sugar (think soda) could encourage the infections.  Did you use antibiotics to get rid of the bacterial infection? If so, you very well may have given yourself another yeast infection.  I would go back to the doc, let her know you're suffering again, and talk about getting rid of the yeast infection and what you could do to break the icky cycle.  I'm sorry.. I know it sucks. Good luck.
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you! I used a cream insert for the yeast infection and then for the BV also. I will see about my bf getting some treatment if that could be triggering these as well. What did your partner use to get rid of his infection(?) 
TwoXChromosomes X You may want to talk to your doc about switching antidepressants. Some have far, far worse libido-lowering side effects than other. 
TwoXChromosomes X Douching is a bad idea. Your vagina has a delicate balance of allsorted bacteria and douching will upset this balance and might cause infections.  If you want to stay clean, use a warm, wet, SOAP-LESS washcloth to gently clean the skin around there.
TwoXChromosomes X My mother has had a similar experience to you, but she has thrush located in her mouth (a vaginal yeast infection is also known as vaginal thrush, thrush can happen in different parts of your body).   She has had it to a varying degree for about a year now. It can be very hard to get rid of when it seemingly has a 'grip' on you, which may have happened when you unfortunately went untreated for so long.  She has totally changed her diet. She doesn't eat any sugar, not even fruit . Also, according to her anyway, she says that doctors aren't very good at treating it, and that pharmacists seem to know more about cases like this and how to overcome it.  For my mother, it was actually because a doctor prescribed a particular antibiotic that she ended up with it. Be careful with antibiotics, and I would say try to find a pharmacist to discuss what sounds like a deeply-imbedded case of thrush. 
BabyBumps X Unfortunately not, with having had a prior c-section and a *horrible* induction experience leading up to that. I don't get why it happened, so many women go into the hospital, start an induction and have a baby effortlessly in very little time whereas my cervix didn't react at all to being induced. I'm kind of okay with that. I'd frankly rather recover from surgery again than find myself once again stuck in a "bed" with three iv feeds and two monitors (one for the contractions, one for the baby,) being fussed at by nurses every single time I moved to try to get comfortable through the pain (no epi or pain meds whatsoever.) 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think there is a social stigma associated with taking the Pill, but I am Australian, and there aren't too many people here who have a problem with contraceptive use.   With perfect use, the pregnancy rate on the Pill is 0.3% per year. (Typical use is between 2-8% - a reminder to be strict with yourself).   The withdrawal method has a 4% pregnancy rate (per year) with perfect use, but a 27% pregnancy rate with typical use (read - it's hard to consistently pull out in time). (Male) condoms, by comparison, have a failure (pregnancy rate) of 2% per year with perfect use, and 15% with typical use. Combining Pill use with one of these options will make a relatively small difference, and nothing but abstinence will guarantee you won't get pregnant.   The most reliable contraceptive method is Implanon, so that's something to consider if it's causing you stress. 
Parenting X Sorry that you are going through this.  If it happens on its own, expect a lot of bleeding.  I was 12 weeks along when I had one of my miscarriages, and we were terrified because of all of the bleeding, but apparently that is normal.  I wasn't in too much physical pain, but emotional is a whole other story.   Again, sorry to you and your wife :(
TwoXChromosomes X If you change your mind then you should be prepared to deal with the consequences of that decision - raising a child alone. 
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think there is any harm - the packs suualy say if you miss more than 3 in a row discard your pack and wait until the first day of your next period to start a new one. I've been on every brand and type of pill imaginable (plus the patch) and have never had any issues, and my doc says it's fine.   Out of curiousity, why did you stop your last one, and why are you now regretting it?
TwoXChromosomes X Don't forget the chance that you'll bring home an STI that they think they're completely protected against because they think you're in a monogamous relationship.  That's their health you're fucking with in addition to everything else.  They have the right to know what they're risking by having sex with you, and they can't come to an informed decision if you withhold information that could impact their sexual health.  Even if you and all of your secret partners use condoms, there's a good chance of catching something like herpes or HPV, and condoms fail, leaving you open to HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, and any other STI's you can think of.  And then your partner in your (supposed to be) monogamous relationship has the risk of being infected with any of those, too, and they don't even know that.  Even if you usually use condoms with your monogamous partner, they should know what they're risking when they have sex with you, and since you're supposed to be monogamous and presumably have been for a while, STI's are probably not on their list of "risks of having sex with monogamous partner," nor should they have to be.
BabyBumps X *hugs*  I haven't had much nausea.  Mostly just feeling queasy or bleh.  I haven't been very emotional either (no weepies) but I have been feeling lonely and down.  I think a lot of it also has to do with my crappy work schedule which should be getting fixed soon.
TwoXChromosomes X I feel so conflicted.  On the one hand, I would never ever want to set restrictions on what a woman wants to do with her body. Too much of that shit is already going on.  On the other hand, it's heartbreaking. At 5 months their face is there. They can hear outside the womb. Hair starts to grow. Internal organs are maturing. It's not yet completely viable, yet it's not just a fertilized egg anymore. It would look like a fucking baby if you took it out. Thinking about getting rid of it stirs up so much inside of me.  The only reason any woman should ever need for an abortion is "because I want to" so it doesn't really matter to me what the reasons are. Good and bad reasons are irrelevant.  Women should be able to abort if the fetus if isn't able to survive on its own. But let me tell you, it fucking breaks my heart.
TwoXChromosomes X I hope it helps &lt;3 the terconazole cream was the only thing that kept me sane as I finished my round of antibiotics... such a horrible infection D:
TwoXChromosomes X Sure. It's still freeloading at that point off of me. And at that point, it's medically still considered a fetus, not a baby.   If the fetus died in utero 1 hour by itself before it was born, then would I be charged for murder? Of course not. 
BabyBumps X Ever since finding out I was pregnant I was determined it would be a boy. I told everyone that too.  Every dream I had told me it was a girl, but I still maintained it was a boy.  It's a boy.
BabyBumps X So she didn't produce any milk?  I bet by 35 weeks you'll be able to manually express something by hand (a few drops from each nipple).  Sometimes it takes a while for it to come in...I bet she would have had more success with the following kids.  
Parenting X Laws for breastfeeding do not typically differenciate between public and private property. If a woman is allowed somewhere while shes not breastfeeding, then shes allowed to also breastfeed. Some babies, like mine, hate being covered up. My daughter will not leave the receiving blanket alone while shes eating. If i try covering her, i spend more time fighting to keep her covered, and my attempt at breastfeeding is much more noticeable than if i expose minimal breast to feed her. If some one doesnt want to see it, then they only need to look away or leave.
BabyBumps X If you have blood in the mucus then call your doctor. If cramps get worse or closer together call the doctor. Other than that just relax.
Parenting X " you just don't starve an infant out of respect for other people's cultures."  Because it's impossible to pump ahead of time.  Or to use a hooter hider or a blanket.  Better whip out the tit for all to see because the above are impossible to do.
BabyBumps X Our plan is to use walking, massage and the bathtub to get as far into labor as possible. After 6 centimeters I am open to an epidural but want to go as far as possible on my own. I am also against pitocin or any other induction method so it'll be a fight...
Parenting X Whipping your sweaty balls out isn't exactly providing another human being with nourishment. Not all babies tolerate being covered, and it's not always possible to pre-pump. When a baby needs to eat, it needs to eat. Outside of a child latched onto a nipple, no one ever seems to complain about seeing breasts. And so what if you saw a boob? If someone flashed you, I doubt you'd argue. I don't like seeing people's ass cracks or rolls hanging out, but I've never seen anyone ask them to cover it up.
BabyBumps X I'm wingin' it!   I only have a few desires, which I communicated to my fiance: I don't want to be asked when I want the epidural: when I want it, I'll let them know. I only want my mom and him in the room when I deliver. I want delayed cord cutting. And finally, I want an hour after the birth with just me, the baby, and my fiance for bonding and feeding. That's all!
BabyBumps X Hmm.  Well, my mom's milk supply dropped drastically at week 6 for me and my brother - it went from lots of milk to no milk. She ended up resorting to formula.  It happened with me, too, but because she warned me about it I had a game plan - i.e Mother's Milk tea. At ~6wks, my supply plummeted and I guzzled the tea. Sill BFing at 12wks. :}
TwoXChromosomes X I did it twice. Whoo dumb self.   It was a lot heavier bleeding, and it threw my cycle out of whack by a few weeks? I'm not sure, it was a while ago. I just know it misaligned my period.  And then I got on birth control. 
Parenting X Why shouldn't little kids see a baby eating the way nature intended? Why are breasts something to be shamefully hidden?
AskWomen X Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone in your urine. That hormone won't be present in high enough concentrations to be detected by a pregnancy test for ~2 weeks; if you test too early, you'll get a false negative result (and waste a test) so it's pointless trying. Even then, it may not be accurate. Either wait and hope for the best, or start looking online for where you can get a morning-after pill from locally.  Waiting to see whether your period comes is very inaccurate -- many factors can affect your period and only one of those is pregnancy. Stressing about a possible pregnancy could even delay it and make you worry even more. Edit: Relying on your period as an indicator also requires that you already know how many days are in your cycle and when your next period should begin. I'd be very surprised if you already have that information but don't understand how to use pregnancy tests. :)
BabyBumps X I can go into work as I please, I took last night off hoping I would go into labor today, no labor today so I think I'm gonna go into work..... I was due on Saturday but little miss thing has her own agenda.
AskWomen X If you're thinking it was a miscarriage, you could go pick up a pregnancy test. They usually will give a false positive for a few weeks after a miscarriage.
Parenting X Yes, if you're working with a specialist, that doc will want to see you very early in the pregnancy to work out the issues.  After 2 losses and 16 months of trying, I got pregnant - thankfully we had started seeing a specialist.  He did blood work every 2 days for the first few weeks.  I was a human pin cushion, but it helped to identify some of the issues that likely kept my previous pregnancies from sticking.  He was able to medicate accordingly and get the pregnancy to stick.  It's very important to have early intervention if you have a history of early losses - and the standard OB is not always able to provide such resources.
BabyBumps X I'm only 14 weeks and can almost swear I've felt baby 'poking' me.  I've had flutters since 9.5 weeks, and they've been getting stronger and more frequent since.  I felt the 'holy crap!  What was that?!' factor with that poke;)  So funny!!!    I can't wait to feel the kicks daily:D  Enjoy that sensation OP :D
BabyBumps X Haha well the truth is, because this if your first especially, it doesn't really mean much. Some women are 3-4cm dilated and practically completely effaced from 36/7 weeks and go past their due date, while others are "baby is very high, cervix is very thick" and end up going into full blown labor later that night/within a week. Once you've already been through labor the dilation/effacement can be more of an indication, but for a first timer, you never really know! I had a friend walk around for 2 weeks at 5cm before the doctor told her to just come in and they'll start things for her. 
BabyBumps X I had a lovely bout with hyperemesis (including hospitalization) from about 7-14 weeks.  Zofran wouldn't work, got sent home on Reglan by mouth and Compazine suppositories in case it got too bad to control with pills.  I lost about 10 lbs in 2 weeks.   Last week is when I first started feeling pseudo-normal again... I still get really nauseated, occasionally vomit, but the zofran seems to be helping me if I take it once a day.    I still can't handle meats very well, nothing fried either...but I'm slowly reintroducing foods into my diet.  Hyperemesis is the worst thing ever and if someone had told me pregnancy was going to be this awful, I would have put more thought into it before I got pregnant, hehehehe...Of course I'm excited for my little one, but this has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Hurray for feeling better now! Little victories... :)
BabyBumps X I have so many weird little sensations that I'm not quite sure if it's gas or digestion or fetus... but not 30 seconds before reading this I felt a distinctly repetitive movement on my left side... I think that was it... I wish I was sure! :/
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, it is irresponsible to get pregnant when you don't mean to. Absolutely. In most cases, there was *something* you could have done but didn't, and whatever the reason was that you didn't probably shows how irresponsible you were.    How much sympathy I have for anyone seeking medical help doesn't have anything to do with whether or not they get that medical help. If they need it, they should get it. Afterwards, sure, open a discussion with them about why they needed that medical help, and what they could do to avoid needing that sort of help again in the future. Help them access the resources and support they need to avoid it. Reach out to others at risk and do the same thing,  but in the meantime let them get that help.  No one should be born because their mother couldn't get an abortion. That's a shitty reason to be here, and a shitty reason to become a parent. The only reason to have children is because you **want** to. It's irresponsible to 'just' have the baby, as if there is no other choice. Women should be encouraged to take hold of their reproduction, and see that it is a choice. Laws and society should not get in the way of that ownership of reproduction.
BabyBumps X Strangers started asking me how far along I was at 11 weeks.,.  But I have a tipped uterus so I think it smooshed things around differently....  I couldn't distinctly feel anything but bloat until around 14 weeks though....
AskWomen X That depends on the IUD.  The "Mirena" IUD (Which is technically an Internal Uterine *System*, not an Internal Uterine *Device*) releases hormones which will almost always lighten a woman's periods, and in many cases, stop them altogether.  However, the "Paraguard" IUD, as stated, typically gives women heavier periods, from a few days longer to sometimes a week.  The women you knew likely had a hormonal IUS, not a copper IUD.  
Parenting X I think it's ok for any woman to whip it out whenever and wherever she wants to feed; however, I wouldn't want my wife to do that, I just wouldn't be comfortable with her having her boob hanging out anywhere. Thankfully, she doesn't. She prefers to sit somewhere and doesn't usually bother using a "hooter hider" or blanket unless there are a ton of people around.  I think businesses should provide a nice area where any woman would be happy to breastfeed. If the woman chooses to not to use it, they should just leave her alone. It will only last 10-20 minutes and then it's done.
BabyBumps X When I got pregnant, I was 50-60lbs overweight. Most of the weight I gained (and you too) comes from water, blood, baby, ect. In my first trimester, I had morning sickness so bad I lost 20lbs. I gained some of it back, but not really in fat. I'm pretty much the same weight (if not a little less) than I was when I got pregnant.  Let me tell you something. When you start to show, you'll forget about your tummy. For me, I'm sooo big, I'm WELCOMING my old little tummy back! It really makes you feel like you took yourself for granted!
TwoXChromosomes X I thought of it but I think I'd be worried to have a piece of copper inside myself. A friend told me about vaginal rings, I think I'm going to try that. The problem is that it might have the same effect on my libido as the pill, in which case the IUD would be the best solution...
AskWomen X I think I look at it more from the issue of bodily autonomy. And phimosis does not particularly require circumcision as far as I know. There are 2 or 3 different methods available, and yes, I had a boyfriend with phimosis once, he had the operation done when he was 25 and they didn't circumcise him, instead they placed a small slit so that the foreskin widened without having to be removed.  I am very, very much on the side of bodily autonomy where it comes to irreversible non-medically necessary changes to an infant's body.
BabyBumps X My pregnancy has been good and bad. I suffered from all day sickness up until 30 weeks and I basically swapped that with heart burn, although it's on and off and doesn't bother me too much.  The only complaint I have now is that I often have trouble sleeping whether it's because I'm anxious or just really restless. If you're lucky enough to be feeling good now, enjoy it and hope it stays around =] 
BabyBumps X I am really lucky. I've had an awesome pregnancy.  I'm older and have some higher risk factors so it was hard to say how my body would handle being pregnant.  But, all went perfectly--until about 38 weeks.  Then the true tiredness kicked in. Not wanting to go upstairs, walk anywhere, get in and out of the car etc.  I have a small window, usually, of feeling pretty good in the morning, but that wears off quickly. It was kind of a shock to me since I had been feeling so great all the way up until 38 weeks (minus some nausea at the beginning and just feeling tired at the beginning).  Thankfully I've been on maternity leave for 3ish weeks so I just nap at will. 
BabyBumps X I felt pretty good up until about 36 weeks - all of a sudden, the heat was absolutely unbearable. In the last few weeks, I've also had to deal with increasing swelling, hip pain, pelvic pain, and frequent contractions. And I've been having a harder and harder time sleeping.   Sorry to be negative! I hope you keep feeling fantastic!

Take the supplement just before sex as a prophylactic measure, but if you are infected it won't cure you - it'll prevent infection or mask the symptoms.  Drink tons of water too.
BabyBumps X My doctor said that they're normal as long as the cervix doesn't start to open and she doesn't want that to happen for a couple of weeks at least, ideally.  She put me on modified bed rest (I can still work) but I'm supposed to rest and drink a lot of water in the meantime. My BH contractions were lasting too long and I had some gross BMs (yay, tmi!) and nausea which I think are all symptoms of possible preterm labor. But it doesn't sound like you're having that problem at all! It's just our bodies getting ready to push out a baby!!  =)
BabyBumps X My sister was 3cm and 80% for 3 weeks before she even went into labor, she labored for over 10 hours before her water broke, and had the baby about 4 hours after that. You might go early, you might not :) Keep us updated 
BabyBumps X At one point I felt like I could pass out. Overall it was just a weird feeling. I have a footrest under my desk to prop them up a bit but I don't sit at a desk all day, I work in a lab so I'm back and forth. I've experienced it from getting up too quickly before but that wasn't the case this time, it just hit me out of nowhere.   I'm sorry you're dealing with it too. I hope you don't have to do bedrest :(
TwoXChromosomes X Do you wear tampons? Those can cause some extreme cramps if they block up the cervix. I recommend a menstrual cup, it's a lot more cervix/vagina friendly.
BabyBumps X I agree with Mae. With my youngest son, I had braxton hicks for several weeks. I was 35/36 or so weeks with him and was dilated to 3 CM. He wasn't born until 39+5 weeks. I was 5 CM at 39 weeks.  And here I am in a similar spot again- 35.5 weeks- 3 CM, 70-75% effaced.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, I almost always wear tampon unless my flow is extremely light (which it usually has been since I started the pill...dunno why it's heavier than usual this time). I'm contemplating getting a diva cup. They sound pretty damn awesome.
TwoXChromosomes X Pap smears are no longer recommended in patients under 21. She might still get a speculum exam to visually check, or perhaps a bimanual exam (fingers in the vagina, feeling that abdomen for the uterus and ovaries), but no pap unless she's got a dr that doesn't follow the recs. HPV is usually only tested for with an abnormal pap (you can send them out to do this automatically).  
TwoXChromosomes X No, in both cases you're killing a perfectly healthy fetus/baby because his/her mother does not want to be a parent.  The only difference is the location: inside the womb vs. out of it.    You've argued that killing a 39 week fetus in the womb ought to be legal.  Should killing that same being out of the womb be legal or illegal?    Arguing that something abhorrent ought to be legal because "no one would actually do it" is strange.  Would you extend that reasoning to anything else, like gun control?  *AK-47s ought to be legal, but don't worry, no one will actually use one without a really, really good reason.*
BabyBumps X I was 5'5" &amp; about 240 when I was 15 wks as well. People I knew could tell I was pregnant near 20 wks, but I became legit pregnant looking around 26 wks I'd say. I still have that "squish" on the sides &amp; underside of my belly, but the middle/upper part is undeniably a baby bump.
TwoXChromosomes X i was told at 15 that due to some problems with my ovaries and uterus i could never have children, i am very ashamed of this but i miscarried 7 times within the time i was 15 to 19, i was stupid and got myself into some bad situations.  but back to my point, i ended up pregnant again at 19, but my son made it to term, i found out i was pregnant again when he was 2 months old, so i now have 2 happy healthy sons even though i was supposed to never be able to. but even if you never conceive, you can adopt a baby when you choose it is the right time in your life, i wish you luck in whatever happens, there is always hope :)
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, I'm worried about when I lose weight. I'm aiming for 50lbs in the next 4 years. I could potentially drop to a 34DDD which is a tough size to find.  From past experience, when I lose weight, it doesn't come off the boobs. 
BabyBumps X Totally fine. She found out she was pregnant very early because she would regularly take pregnancy tests due to the absence of periods. I'm not entirely sure exactly how they removed the IUD, perhaps they checked with an ultrasound first to make sure it wouldn't disturb the pregnancy. I know it's best to get it out as early as possible, but in some circumstances it might be left in place (in a more advanced pregnancy). 
BabyBumps X This is from a few days ago [26 weeks]( ).  I'm going to be all belly in a few weeks - I'm 5' tall so baby can only go out from now on....
TwoXChromosomes X Also a PCOS'er. I feel your pain.   My periods were like that BEFORE birth control ... Have you talked to your ob/gyn about maybe not having periods ...? I use the nuvaring for 4 wks, take it out and put a new one in. No periods. I do have mild cramping and ovary pain throughout the month, but NOTHING like my normal periods.   Also, are you on metformin? I don't know if it's still 'standard of care' for PCOS (i've heard varying stories and haven't cared to look it up myself), but it was when i was diagnosed 5 years ago. My periods regulated on just metformin (though i wasn't as bad as you ... I was about every 6-8 weeks) and i just feel a lot better since i've been on it. I don't know if they know exactly how it works in PCOS, but the theory is that it corrects the insulin resistance that often comes w/ PCOS, and that regulates other hormones. In fact, my last hormone panel (while we were trying to conceive, so i was birth control free) was NORMAL!!   Does your ob/gyn specialize in PCOS? I know some know more than others ... I saw a 'reproductive endocrinologist' b/c we were trying to conceive, and he was extremely knowledgeable. I think endocrinologists deal w/ this too ... It IS an endocrine problem ... The ovaries are just a symptom.   Best of luck. Hang in there. 
BabyBumps X I was 5'1" about 165 lbs. I didn't start showing (noticeably) until about week 30. When I had my first one I was about 5' 115 lbs and still didn't show until about 24 weeks. It really just depends. Right now I'm pretty noticeably pregnant (although not as large in the bump as other women as far along as me) and I've still got a bit of flabby skin hanging right below my tummy. Not sure if that will go away eventually or become part of my bump. Hope this helps.
BabyBumps X I think the baby isn't big enough until 11 or 12 weeks to see on abdominal u/s, that's when they perform the nuchal transparency u/s. They did mine outside and vaginally at that point, but I had gotten an ultrasound at 8 weeks and they were still restricted to vaginal to find the baby at that point. That's from my understanding, at least, but I think OP isn't far enough along for anything but vaginal. 
BabyBumps X Firstly, Congrats!! :)  Secondly, I'm 5'6 and was 175 when I got pregnant.  Because I was about 270 a few years before, I have a lot of extra skin.  I didn't show noticeably until week 20, and at this point in week 28 I've still got extra skin to fill out, but it's getting closer.  
BabyBumps X Yes, I am so done.  I have a constant severe pain in my ribs and the only position I can be in is laying on my back.  If I sit, stand, lean- whatever- within an hour I'm in severe pain again.  This pain triggered IU, so my belly is contracted 90% of the time.  Usually it's just mildly uncomfortable, but it hurts when anything touches my contracted belly, and if my bladder is even mildly full my contractions turn painful.  My insomnia is back as well, I miss my sleeping pills. And I have another 7-12 weeks to go. :(
Parenting X Agreed - for the first six to eight weeks when supply is being established mom should just focus on nursing as much as possible.  Also, pumping just adds another thing mom needs to do.  I never got into pumping because it didn't seem like a time saver. It is just one more thing to do and is a lot less efficient at getting milk out than nursing. Also, if you miss a feeding you still have to pump to alleviate engorgement and maintain supply.  The thing that helped me was having my husband assume responsibility for all household tasks and holding baby while i napped while I focused on nursing. Side nursing is how I got through nighttime feedings. It took practice but now I barely have to wake to feed my son. 
BabyBumps X My husband and I both wanted to find out because we knew that as soon as we found out gender we were going to name it (had names picked out forever.) And for us that helped us bond with the baby. We liked being able to call the baby by its name and not "it" all the time. Also, I was really hoping for a girl, and I wasn't sure how I was going to react if I found out it was a boy- I did not want to have a bad reaction at the birth of my baby. Turns out, I was totally fine when the ultrasound said boy, but I'm glad I found out because it's given me plenty of time to get used to the idea and now I couldn't be more excited to meet my little boy!
BabyBumps X The nubs get bigger or smaller depending, lol. At 15 weeks they can tell, but it takes a clear shot and an experienced tech, by 20 it's much easier to see boy or girl. I'm getting my determination at 18 weeks although I'm dying to try and go now, lol. 
BabyBumps X I was SURE I'd feel entirely different when I became pregnant.  I thought I'd feel all happy and glowy and wonderful all the time and that it would just be magical.  Well not so much.  I didn't feel different.  I didn't feel magical-I felt sick and tired. Now at 18 weeks I can feel my baby kicking around inside me-and it's STILL hard to believe sometimes.  
TwoXChromosomes X I use the Instead Softcup. It has no stem. If you try the DivaCup and the stem bothers you, try the Instead Softcup... instead. It's like inserting and taking out a Nuvaring, not sure you would know what that's like, but its the closest thing I know to compare it to. 
BabyBumps X Although it isn't exact, I just put your numbers into babycenter's Pregnancy Weight Tracker using my prepregnancy data (I was also at a healthy BMI prepregnancy). You are well within the healthy range. American pregnancy also says that 1-4.5 pounds in the first trimester is normal.   I would switch midwives. One of the first nurses I saw about my pregnancy tried to tell me that I shouldn't be concerned about lack of early weight gain with twins and that I'd be fine if I only gained 25-35 pounds total. I now have a doctor who actually knows what she's talking about and I feel much better!
BabyBumps X Thats why I just opted to wait until 19-20 weeks to get my first ultrasound. Hearing the heartbeat was and still is exciting enough for me.   It'll be more exciting in a month! Plus you will have your SO around. Maybe it's for the best. Seeing your LO for the first time together! 
BabyBumps X I felt the same way for the 12-21ish week period.  I was past the anxiety of the first trimester, but I wasn't feeling movements or anything cool yet.  I didn't feel pregnant at all, and was really pretty bored with it..  For me, it picked up around 22 weeks, when I started to feel him move on a more regular basis and honestly, I don't really know where all the time in between then and now went.  You'll get past this plateau and time will start to fly once you realize everything you need to get done before baby gets here!  :)  
BabyBumps X I was obese when I got pregnant and gained 20 lbs in the first 12 weeks and my OB never said a word to me! I ended up not gaining any more weight until about a week before delivery. Had no problems with BP or GD. And I weigh 40 lbs less than when I started, 70 pounds less than my highest pregnancy weight!
TwoXChromosomes X When someone sits down and the blood pooled in her panties touches the seat and someone else has to clean it up, I see it as very unsanitary. Panties were not made to hold period blood, they are meant to collect normal everyday discharge. 
BabyBumps X I miscarried at 6 weeks 2 days in December.  My hcg was 20.  It was so low, they would not even do an ultrasound.  I went back three days later and it had dropped to 4.  I was devastated.  Had that baby survived, I would be almost due at this moment.  My due date was 8/8/2012.  My period refused to come back.  They did an ultrasound to check for PCOS, and I did not have any.  So, they gave me Provera to jump start my period and hopefully begin the ovulation cycle again.  It worked! I got pregnant that same cycle.  I'm now 15 weeks pregnant.
BabyBumps X I didn't start feelin sick and tired until week 8 really but then it was terrible and didn't let up until 16 weeks...and I still gag a lot and puke every now and again. You'll be feeling something soon enough. The exhaustion is incredible. That might kick in as soon as 7weeks. I just remember coming home, taking my bra off and thinking I'd just take a little nap and then realizing it was time to go to work again. Enjoy the energy you have while it lasts! 
BabyBumps X Once I moved up into the second trimester last week, I saw all these threads where ladies were talking about just now finding out about pregnancy, going in to get their pregnancy confirmed, being due in March, etc.  I was like, oh man! That was me not so long ago.  I became a baby bumper at just 3 weeks pregnant, so I can relate to their excitement.  It won't be long until I join the third trimester club, then the full-term club, and finally graduate.  *tear* 
BabyBumps X That's awesome that you've found an agency that can understand the things that you want and is going to be able to help you figure it all out.  I'm sure your baby is going to have an amazing experience growing up.  Both to be in the care of a couple that desperately wants to raise a child and has been able to prepare for them, and to know how much his/her birth parents cared to give them the best that you could.  :D
BabyBumps X We tell her that her baby brother will be here for Christmas :) that seems to get her excited! I can't get her to sit still long enough yet to feel Drake kick, but i'm sure it will happen soon! That's awesome that yours is so excited to meet baby :)
TwoXChromosomes X I recommend reading *The Purity Myth* by Jessica Valenti. She discusses the problematics of only "excusing" abortion in cases like rape because it relies on the assumption that it's *okay* for a woman to not want a child if her *purity* had been *stolen* by her, rather than because her informed decision to have consensual sex resulted in an unwanted pregnancy.  Keep in mind that other forms of birth-control are not fail-proof! Condoms can break and pills (although rarely) may not be absorbed properly. Also, by saying abortion is "too often" used as a form of birth control, wouldn't that suggest that *other* forms of birth control *should have* been used to avoid pregnancy? But how do young people having sex know how to properly use contraceptives if they're taught abstinence-only in schools, or they're expected to remain virgins until marriage?  And regardless, to even assume women use the possibility of abortion as birth control is absurd and condescending. Do you think a 15 year old girl has the $500-$1000 it costs to get an abortion? Or that she would even want to go through an invasive procedure, esp with the shame that society imposes on her? Most likely, she wasn't educated on how to properly use contraceptives, or maybe it was just an accident!  Regardless, we need to *trust* women to make the right decisions for themselves, and support whatever decision that is, rather than patronize them and control their bodies.
TwoXChromosomes X Please don't downplay the potential side effects of the ParaGard.  While I think it is a wonderful option for many women and I am thrilled you are having a positive experience with it, the ParaGard doesn't just "increase cramping."  It is basically guaranteed to make your periods much heavier, more painful, and longer for at least the first 3-6 months.  While some women are very happy with their ParaGard and luck out and do not have significantly heavier or more painful periods, others are not so lucky and are never rid of the intense bleeding except when ridding themselves of the IUD.  I don't like hormonal birth control for myself having had bad side effects from all the forms I have been on (note: I have not had a Mirena), and was thrilled to get my ParaGard.  However, my periods only got heavier and longer, until I was bleeding for 2 weeks every month.  My cycles also shortened to 23-24 days, so I was bleeding more often than not.  During my 2-3 heavy days I would bleed so much I would have to change my menstrual cup every 2 hours.  2 hours!  Overnight, I would bleed through my cup, an overnight pad, and then onto a towel.  I tried a variety of methods to try and abate the horrendous bleeding, and it never ended until I got the IUD out.  The Mirena has the smallest amount of hormones of any hormonal birth control out there, and something like only 5% of women experience hormonal side effects from it.  Given that the OP ALREADY has a history of long, painful periods, I think trying the Mirena first would be a better bet then going with something that is almost guaranteed to give her even heavier and more painful periods.
BabyBumps X Your regular OB's treatments and tests sound stranger to me than the specialist's. The thing that sounded strangest to me was that he would put you on 9 months of Clomid and then tell you that you weren't ovulating without verifying with an ultrasound. When I was on Clomid (prescribed by a fertility specialist, not my OB) they would give me an ultrasound when they expected ovulation and they could tell me which ovary had ovulated and how many eggs were released. They could tell if I was about to ovulate or if I just had. It was actually really cool.  The prenatal care you have been receiving from the specialist sounds normal for a woman that has had fertility treatments. It's not uncommon for women that have had a hard time conceiving to have a high risk pregnancy and a higher than normal risk of miscarriage and therefore be closely monitored.  Congratulations on your pregnancy, by the way.   
BabyBumps X Haha I get told I'm having twins, but I'm not. I get asked if I'm sure I'm not having twins, maybe one is hiding, etc. No, its just Leo in there, we've seen him multiple times now lol. I've also gained a ridiculous amount of weight for my size, but luckily I'm still all belly, and with my belly being so big it makes the rest of me look small haha
BabyBumps X Your milk doesn't even come in for sometimes a few days after the baby is born. But you will have colostrum for your newborn to suckle. Just remember a teaspoon of colostrum is a feast for a newborn. 
BabyBumps X :) Thank you, I guess this feeling I'm having is due to the dreaded "in-between looking fat and looking pregnant" stage, I just never thought it would bother me :/
BabyBumps X Yay! I'm hoping we're early and its more of a Thanksgiving baby (of course every time I say that my mom just starts ROFLing). But hooray Monday- I can't WAIT!
TwoXChromosomes X I wholly agree (and have even described it as a "parasite" myself at times!)  Fetal viability is a huge concept that I think gets overlooked and ignored all too often in the debates about what should be permitted and what should not.   I don't think I, personally, could ever be comfortable with the idea of an abortion that was performed after the point a fetus would most likely be viable outside the womb, but up until that point, just as you said--it's very much fully dependent on the woman.
BabyBumps X The reason they tested me was for severe itching, which revealed high liver enzymes. The ANA test showed I had autoimmune hepatitis and the biopsy is to determine the extent of damage to my liver, if any. Basically, the assumption is that I've unknowingly had this for a while and the pregnancy caused a flare up of some kind.    I'll know more after I see the rheumatologist and will let you know if it seems like something you should be concerned about as well. For now, I'm just not worrying about it, and it doesn't seem like there is a significant risk to the baby, which was my main concern.
BabyBumps X Thank you. The pregnancy wasn't easy though. I have been super nauseous and sick my entire pregnancy. I'm now on Zofran to control it because I kept losing weight. I was throwing up around 3-6 times a day.
TwoXChromosomes X Awesome. I had hpv and had to have my cervix frozen and then scraped for pre cancerous cells. Glad you are clear too. =)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; if it is a stupid idea to not use condoms and rely solely on hormonal birth control.  Yes, it is responsible to use only hormonal birth control. Like you said yourself, birth control used correctly is just about as close to 100% effective as you can statistically get. Condoms are great for when you either are not on a hormonal birth control, or when you are not sure of your partner's sexual history. You are doing all the right things. You're getting tested, you're in a stable relationship, and you're using your pills perfectly. Don't worry about. I myself hate condoms, so I actually went on the pill before losing my V-card so I wouldn't have to use them with my long-term bf ;)
TwoXChromosomes X The pill is going to mess with your period for a while, expect stuff like that monthly.  Nothing to be alarmed about, the pill usually takes 5-7 days to fully get into your system and start working, but maybe it started early for you.   Remember, the pill stops your period. That why we take 7 days of placebo.
TwoXChromosomes X If condoms are not working and you are afraid to rely on just your hormonal methods, why not use a different barrier method as assurance, such as [contraceptive sponges]( _sponge) or a [diaphragm]( _(contraceptive\))? Neither of these methods have a low enough failure rate that I would be comfortable using them alone, but in conjunction with hormonal birth control, they help shift your chances of pregnancy to vanishingly small. I personally would feel okay using just hormonal methods, but your personal peace of mind is of very high importance!
TwoXChromosomes X Fresh garlic clove, peel it, and shove it up there. Worked for me.
BabyBumps X I was really scared with my son but I found it was an out of body experience and time wasn't a factor. I have a really low pain threshold but I did it with no drugs! I also had a water birth which I loved and will be doing again. Good luck, it's not as bad as you think it's going to be x also, remember to breath!  Haha seems obvious but my immediate reaction was to hold my breathe but Breathing made it hurt less
TwoXChromosomes X im sorry, human persons? an embryo is a person now? you know i WOULD say it is wrong to compare these two issues. the 12 people who died werent INSIDE the body of the killer at the time.
AskWomen X Agreed!  I had a c-section, so I didn't get the birth experience I'd hoped for.  However, I LOVED that feeling of growing my baby inside of me...carrying him everywhere easily, and feeling / watching every little movement in there - just amazing!  And hearing his heartbeat...seeing him on the ultrasound...all just magical for me!  The first five months of puking several times a day...not so magical!   ;  ) but it was all worth it beyond that.  I think Most women, toward the end of pregnancy are ready to "get it out"!  Not me...it was hard to let go of that part!
AskWomen X My boyfriend has HSV-1 I don't think it's a big deal. I have it too, I get oral breakouts when I stress and occasionally he will get breakouts other places. A majority of HSV-1 breakouts are oral and over 90% of the population has been exposed to it.   Are you sure you have HSV-1 and not 2? How frequent are your breakouts?   Source: -simplex-000079.htm
BabyBumps X Awesome! They told me I was probably due a week earlier (but the doctor needed to confirm it) but I don't know if that means I'm now almost 20 weeks instead of 19 or how that works?!
CsectionCentral X I had a c-section super early at 29 weeks and I had to pump to get my milk going at all. I wasn't even able to try to nurse for several weeks. Because of all these factors (and stress I'm sure!) my milk never got to the point I could exclusively breastfeed, unfortunately. Now my son is home (yay!) and nurses before pretty much every bottle feeding.
AskWomen X It's not a *total* rip off, IMO, there is a trade off: women have multiple orgasms, they have different kinds of orgasms (vaginal and clitoral) and they have more intense orgasms.  Also women can give birth to children.  So my contention has always been that as women have the superior equipment, it simply requires more maintenance  :)
TwoXChromosomes X I got it, and I love it. It's reduced my periods (the last one I had was 10 months ago, so they might have just stopped), and I don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill.  However, please keep in mind that everybody reacts differently to it. In another TwoXC discussion, another woman told me her periods lengthened and increased in frequency after she got an Implanon. If the symptoms are extreme, get it removed and look into other methods.
BabyBumps X I think it mostly depends on exactly how heavy you are to begin with, and how you carry it. I'm 5'3, started at 195ish. This is me at 4 months. , just yesterday. At this point I've gained 15 lbs. , so I'd say I look pretty typically pregnant. If you're top heavy it will probably take longer to start showing.  
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think it matters when you start, I was mid cycle when I first went to the gyno and got birth control and she told me to take my first pill that night.  That being said, your body might have more difficulty adjusting to the hormones if you took it before your period started, so you should expect some spotting within the first month or so. Also it'd be a good idea to use a condom until you've finished the first pack.
BabyBumps X I've got a short torso, too. My hips seriously end above where my belly button is. I mean, I can notice a little showing, but so far, no one else has.   Thank you! :D
BabyBumps X Thanks for sharing. I'm about the same weight as when I started. I'm eating and slowly gaining and my doctor doesn't seem too concerned so I'm not worried...yet. Of course I'm only at 23 weeks. When did you gain the most weight? 
TwoXChromosomes X Me.  I gain weight VERY evenly.  When some of us at my job did a weight loss thing, we had to put in $50 each and weigh ourselves in from of everyone in the contest. They almost fell over at how much I weighed vs. what they thought I weighed.  (Also I won.)  At the time I weighed 197 but I really looked at least 15-20 lbs lighter.  I have been holding at 183, and would like to get down to 155 someday.  that is the higher end of my healthy weight range.  Problem is, I am really comfortable with myself at this weight and it makes it hard to do the next push.
BabyBumps X I don't get ultrasounds besides the 20 week scan and at my NSTs after 40 weeks so I don't have to worry about being pressured into induction anyway!
beyondthebump X I am 6 weeks postpartum and am breastfeeding. I have had period like bleeding twice since my bleeding stopped at about 3 weeks. I called my Dr. today to make sure everything was normal and they said bleeding off and on is normal up to 12 weeks postpartum.
CsectionCentral X Good luck with the induction! I had an emergency c-section after 40 hours  of unprogressive labor (I was induced due to pre-e). I was most surprised with how quickly I recovered! The one thing I wish I had done differently was insist on having the baby brought to me. They rushed him away asap and I didn't see him until I was in the recovery room.   
Parenting X My triplets were born just shy of 32 weeks. Just turned 1. It gets soooo much better.   One of my NICU nurses is coming to the party. Woot!
BabyBumps X I gained 50lbs with my daughter. I was 130lbs before pregnancy lost 20 right after I had her but 30lbs stayed :( She's 3 now and im on baby number 2. Luckily this time I'm not gaining as much. 
TwoXChromosomes X I definitely plan to do a home birth next time if at all possible. I had a lot of complications which I think could have been prevented had I not been induced. I had a fever and dangerously high blood pressure and the baby was in a lot of distress. Our blood mixed together and it turns out we have an ABO blood incompatability, so she had severe jaundice from birth. She aspirated a *lot* of fluid and it was a while before they let me hold her because it took to long to clear her airways. I think a lot of this was from the *stress* of the unnatural labor.   I'm surprised in retrospect that they didn't give me a c-section. Thankfully I have both insurance and medicaid.
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm, I still didn't know that women recently post-partum were more at risk. Had I heard that at the time I probably would've waited.
TwoXChromosomes X Something like that, yes. I never exactly measured but there was always quite a bit of string. Two loops, each about 3 inches wide with some left over.  Edit: You got me wondering about the string length. According to [The Mayo Clinic]( =what-you-can-expect), your doctor may trim the strings when they're done. Clearly my doctor didn't, but it never bothered me. The strings soften up in a couple of weeks and even beforehand you never feel them.
BabyBumps X give your doc a call and they usually will tell you over the phone. I had a ton of spotting first pregnancy lol so we did blood tests and then ultrasounds out the wazoo.  It's probably nothing though so I wouldn't worry about it but I know I do a ton of worrying.
Parenting X Congrats on your boys!  I just want to start off with saying that my argument is against circumcision in infants- what a man decides to do to his own body is his business.  I dont want to fight anybody, I just want to share some information Ive found to help the OP make a choice.  Feel free to look at the reasons given from the other side of the argument- its an important decision that you need to make- I just thought it would be helpful to give what you asked for.  That said, here are my reasons not to circ.  1)It is easier for a man to circ later, than it is to try and renew an already circed foreskin.  Getting circed is an out-patient procedure and will cost him some time and money.  The time is short.  Attempting to renew a foreskin takes a couple years of commitment to wearing a device that stretches what is left of the foreskin, and it will never be like it once was.  Theres a lot of information to be had on this - )Complications   3-9% of boys experience complications right away. 5% have complications later.  You can find a detailed list on one of the sites Im providing of just WHAT, but just think of it like this- their penis is tiny right now, wouldnt it be better to come at it with a scalpel when theres more to work with?  And when you wont be putting that fresh cut in a diaper?  Stuff you may not know is that a lot of circed men end up with hair on their shaft, curved penises, and painful erections because too much was cut off.  3)Pain/Trauma  Its very painful no matter what age you are.  Did you know they strap down the poor child spread eagle?  Being restrained in this way is very traumatic for a baby.  Im not saying they wont eventually forget it, but it just seems like a better idea when the boy/man is old enough to know whats going on.  Imagine if a doctor said nothing to you, strapped you down, and cut your penis- no explanation.  Seems scary to me.  4)Cleanliness  The argument that it is easier to care for a circed penis than a non-circed penis is an uneducated one.  A freshly circed penis needs a lot more care and attention than an uncut one.  You are actually NOT supposed to pull back the foreskin, or force it back at all.  The foreskins purpose is to protect the glans (head) from dirty things (such a urine and feces) and abrasion.  The accumulation of smegma is actually a healthy thing, it is a natural emoliant that keeps the glans soft and sensitive.  5)Sexual Pleasure later in life  When you leave a man intact, the glans stays moist, and sensitive. When you cut him, his glans becomes dry, calloused, and desensitized from exposure and chafing.  Men who are uncut, and later get circed report feeling desensitized, some say that more than half the pleasure is gone from sex.  Add to that that the foreskin itself contains nerves that derive sexual pleasure- complete removal of it takes away that kind of pleasure completely leaving only the less sensitive kind derived from the glans.  6)What are the reasons FOR the procedure?  This procedure is one steeped in religion.  It is supposed to be a covenant with god to show your devotion to him and separate yourselves from nonbelievers.  If you dont believe, thats certainly not incentive.  The reasons the medical community STARTED to circ all boys was to try and curb masturbation- which they used to attribute to many diseases that have since been proven not related.  In fact most any medical argument pro-circ has argued has been disproved with the exception (so far) of a 60% drop in the potential to contract HIV/AIDS, but only in the case of hetero-sexual intercourse being the means of transmission.  Considering your child wont be sexually active for at least another 12 years, its a weak argument for circumcising an infant.  The last pro-circ argument (that I am aware of) is that your child will be different and teased.  Keeping children intact is on the rise here in the States, and if we continue to educate instead of go with the crowd, uncut will be the norm.  Circed or not, your child will have to deal with being teased at some point- given my other reasons not to, this is also a weak argument FOR circumsicion.  In conclusion  Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to give the facts.  I admit that I feel strongly about the subject, and that you may find something compelling on the other side of the debate coin, but I wanted to step up and give information.  These are the things my husband wishes he knew when he had his sons (previous marriage), these are things many of my male friends wished their parents had known.  We get so outraged about female circumcision, yet we do this to our boys without batting an eye.  It makes me sad.  Websites: 
Parenting X He was 7 weeks early, and weighed 3 pounds 14 ounces at birth.  Went down a few ounces before rebounding.  He was 14 pounds 7 ounces this morning. 
Parenting X I didn't circumcise my son. I don't see the point. If he is that worried about the cosmetic aspect when he gets older, he can have the procedure done.  You can fluff up statistics on HIV (in Africa) or UTI or phimosis (&lt;5%?) but in reality, it is a cosmetic procedure that most other countries don't routinely subject their infants to.   I am not altering my child's body without his consent. Period.
TwoXChromosomes X Plain, no sugar added yogurt. Right in there. It cools and the probiotics kill the yeast.
AskWomen X I've never cared about the size of a mans flaccid penis. It's not going inside me when it's flaccid so why should I care? 
BabyBumps X Okay, sorry to bug you but I'm trying to get a pulse on this whole early pregnancy bleeding thing. My best friend had bleeding heavy enough about 4-5 weeks into her pregnancy that she thought it was her period. I'm having bleeding but not heavy enough to get on my panty liner. But enough that I'm slightly concerned. No pain though, just a lot of nausea and a full feeling like I've drank too much water but in the uterus area.  With the lack of pain or cramping, I'm not thinking ER trip will be needed. My GP's office didn't seem concerned either.  What was your bleeding like? Mostly watery? Mostly blood? Any clumps? Please please excuse me if it's TMI, just comparing to me and what my best friend experienced. 
TwoXChromosomes X Absolutely not. It is none of anyones goddamned business if a woman has an abortion, or how many she has.  I think that in most cases where women are having many abortions, they are either unaware of their contraceptive options, or they are unable to obtain them. The answer is to provide all women with access to free contraception and to have mandatory comprehensive sex-ed in schools. The answer is NOT taking away a woman's right to make her own medical decisions.
BabyBumps X I seemed to miss the 2nd trimester energy bus too. I felt pretty good during my second tri but I didn't have much energy 
AskWomen X I had a drug free vaginal birth at the beginning of this month. I ended up laboring for close to 48 hours however the first 30 hours was like nothing more than a periodic crampy feeling. I went for walks, slept and watched a movie.  Once things ramped up on their own I could still relax through contractions and was dozing in between.   The worst part for me was transition, or when I was finally dilating the final few centimeters.  I did that in a jacuzzi tub and had my husband pressing very hard on my lower back to help deal with the pain.   Pushing was the easiest and I honestly did not experience the ring of fire when my baby crowned. Pushing lasted all of six minutes and once my baby's head could be felt by me she came out in one push with only a small tear that wasn't stitched.  All in all, I'd do it again the same.
BabyBumps X I actually forgot I was pregnant once. The morning after I got the positive test I went outside for my morning smoke, and as I put the cigarette out, I remembered that I'm pregnant. I felt soooo horrible.   You're not alone. It's easy to slip your mind, especially if you're lucky in the first tri and don't end up with terrible morning sickness. 
TwoXChromosomes X no need for plan B, assuming you are taking your b.c pill correctly. Do you take the pill every day, at a similar time?
TwoXChromosomes X I've been to the gyno every year since I was 16 (now 25). It's no big deal. Your doc has seen far more vaginas than most teenagers have seen in porn.  What happens is you lay on a table, put your feet into stirrups, and the doc pulls in an overhead light. The doc gets warmed tools, lubes them up, and then inserts a speculum (it looks like a duck, really). This helps to open the vaginal up for examination. If you are getting a pap smear, the doc will use a long q-tip to gently scrape a few cells from the cervix (for me, it tickles because I am a freak). The doc will take all that out, lube up the fingers, and insert one or two inside while pressing on your abdomen to check for other issues.  NO idea what kind of lump you're talking about, so I can't say anything about that.  Price wise, it depends where you go and if you have insurance. If you go to Planned Parenthood, many of them are publicly funded, they're free to under 18s. Some aren't, so you have to check. They can also accept insurance. If you have insurance and are going to a private doc, then it'll usually say on the insurance card how much it costs.  Good luck, and don't worry too much ;) It's something you'll be doing at least once a year for many years to come, so it's good to get the first one out of the way! 
BabyBumps X Haha, I always end up finishing the package within a week. I'm a fatty. Oh well. I've only gained thirty pounds and I'm almost done being pregnant, so I don't even care anymore. 
BabyBumps X They check EVERYTHING at the anatomy scan, it takes ages. The chambers of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, limbs,  everything. I had to get up and walk around a few times during mine cause she wasn't in the right position, and it took well over an hour to get all of the precise measurements. I'd ask if they're doing a thorough anatomy scan, or are you paying solely to find out the sex. I'd be concerned they don't recommend one, I thought it was the one scan everyone suggests you do. 
BabyBumps X I had an initial dating ultrasound at 8 weeks, but with a different OB, and then I got a second ultrasound with this OB after I switched when I was 12 weeks. Both were fairly brief, &gt;20min, and just basically seemed to be looking for CRL.
TwoXChromosomes X Early pregnancy symptoms can mimic PMS and other illnesses. If you think that you could be pregnant you really need to take a home pregnancy test and/or see a Dr. You can pick up a home pregnancy test for as little as a dollar at the dollar store.
BabyBumps X Yeah, it's hard on both ends. I think I was judged at my job a lot for always running to the bathroom to throw up and it unnerved me. I was constantly weak and in a terrible mood. But damn it teaching Kindergarten is hard work anyway and having morning sickness made it 10x worse. I was pulling over on the side of the road to throw up every morning on the way to work...like clockwork, at 7:15, I had to pull over and vomit. Then I had to get right back in my car and go to work. There was no way I could just take my entire first trimester off. I had a couple of days I couldn't go in. And people who had had easier pregnancies gave me a LOT of grief and I wanted to punch them in the tits. Okay, congratulations, your pregnancy wasn't this hard. Mine is! Nothing I can do! Gah you would have to pay me millions to relive those first 14 weeks.  But I think I could see someone having a hard time after you didn't throw up and be like "man that girl is weak." Unfortunately I had a stomach of steel before I was pregnant. I would get the same stomach virus going around to everyone in the school that made people puke their guts out and all I would get was gas and a fever. Pregnancy fucked my shit UP.
Parenting X Hell fucking no, don't do it. I would rather lose a finger than my foreskin.   First up: it's not yours. It's his. Bodily integrity is a human right. Imposing cosmetic surgery on non-consenting infants is not.   Second, foreskins are awesome. Let me count the ways:  * Tens of thousands of nerve endings. That's an *astounding* amount of sensory bandwidth.  * Those nerve endings include a whole lot of sensitive stretch receptors - as the foreskin moves, it reports a whole lot of positional detail. That's a whole extra *kind* of sensation we're talking about.  * Frictionless gliding mechanism. The foreskin isn't just a "piece of skin", it's a toroidal linear bearing, providing *completely* frictionless movement, far superior to any amount of lubrication. Okay, break to explain this one:  Take a stretchy satin shirt, with the sleeves too long, about a hand-length past your fingertips. Put it on, turn the end of the sleeve in on itself, and glue the cuff to your watch strap. You now have a functional model of an intact penis. Your hand is the glans, the sleeve is the foreskin, your arm is the shaft.   Now grasp your sleeve, and extend your arm to look at your watch. The fabric *rolls* over your hand - it doesn't slide. There's no friction against your hand at all, because nothing slides over it.   Or take a pinch of eyelid/elbow/scrotum skin, and rub between thumb and finger. Again, no friction on your finger pads whatsoever, despite a firm grip. This is what we experience. We don't need lube to masturbate, because we have something far better built-in.   * Stimulation from friction **sucks** next to frictionless massaging. Intact guys have access to both - and while friction can be an interesting place to visit, none of us would ever want to live there. * The frenulum is known by some as the 'male clitoris', and is exquisitely sensitive. Even if it's preserved (it usually isn't), one of the things it's most sensitive to is stretching as the foreskin retracts. No foreskin, no stretching, you've just lost a vast amount of sexual pleasure.  * The foreskin protects and moisturises the surface of the glans (which is an *internal organ*, and does not have skin), keeping it sensitive and supple. Men undergoing foreskin restoration report that the difference in sensation is akin to the difference between wearing a condom and going bareback.  * Because we don't rely on friction for stimulation, condoms don't suck *nearly* as much for us as they do for circumcised guys.   There are no good reasons to circumcise.   * Hygiene is not an issue. Five seconds in the shower, just pull back, wash, release, done. Washing your ears is harder work than that, but you don't go cutting those off.  * I daresay that there are lots of guys in the world that find intact female genitalia 'weird', too - but if someone suggested you should cut up your daughter to suit them, you'd punch them in the face. Think about that.  * In some places, the majority of girls are circumcised, too. If you went to live there, would you have your daughter circumcised so she would be "normal"?  Even if you wanted to, there's no good reason to do it early.   * It's his body, it ought to be his competent adult choice. You wouldn't give him a tattoo - or even let him get one himself - until he was an adult, so why this?  * Done as an adult (assuming he wanted to), there's vastly more margin for error, plus he could actually choose exactly how he wanted it done.  * In infancy, the foreskin is fused to the glans, like your nails are fused to the nail bed - and needs to be forcibly stripped free. Why deliberately choose the extra-traumatic option? * Infants cannot be given sufficient pain relief, either during the operation or during the healing process. There's research to indicate that the trauma has permanent effects on neural development, including permanently lowering their pain tolerance. Why would you do that to your own kid?  * A diaper environment is a *terrible* place for a wound to heal. Jesus, just think about that.    And that's not even covering stuff that can go wrong. Google for 'botched circumcision' sometime, along with 'necrotizing fasciitis'.   In short: there's lots of inherent downsides, lots of risks, no benefits, and no all-fired hurry to do it as a child.   Just leave it alone. Your kid does not need bits cut off him.    
TwoXChromosomes X I went to get a lump checked out. They did not perform a pelvic examination. (No insertion of anything.) He just looked at my lump (a sebaceous cyst) and said I could get it removed or keep it. If it hurts and is that big it sounds like a cyst. Cyst removals are pretty easy, you can find them on youtube even, no big deal. I ended up keeping mine so basically the only thing that happened is he just looked at my vulva area.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think mine is severe enough for accutane, but its definitely noticable and annoying as all hell. And yeah, I've web thinking about an iud too, but it scares me to have a foreign object up in me for that long, plus a close friend of mine had one and after 2 years the doctor couldn't find it anymore (her uterus just absorbed it) and she had to have some crazy painful stuff done to get it out, however she still claims it was worth it cause she basically had no periods and def had no babies.
BabyBumps X For me I received it so late in labor that minimal amounts really had time to get to my son.  This would vary depending how long labor was but I received it not long before actual delivery.  The fear of prolonging labor and distress that can cause in the baby seems to make me feel more comfortable with drugs such as morphine. I however didn't have morphine as it does not work for me i don't remember what exactly I had.  It can make the baby a little lathargic when they arrive but I'm not aware of any more serious side effects, I'm sure there is potential for worse effects but I only received one dose. This time I plan to try all natural no drugs but I'm not afraid to ask for them if I need them 
BabyBumps X Totally normal. Morning sickness always comes back to me the last couple weeks. 
BabyBumps X I started showing a lot earlier with this pregnancy.  Probably around 10 weeks you could tell I had a little "pooch".  
AskWomen X I used to date a guy whose penis was average length (5.5") and a good girth. I liked it a lot, and he was wonderfully enthusiastic in bed. BUT the biggest turn-off was how insecure he was about his size! He could not shut up about penis size, whether it was his, what he estimated others' to be, etc. Constantly referring to himself as small made *me* start to think of him as small, when I would not have done so otherwise.  Basically, don't worry about size so much. You are average, not small. Skill, communication, closeness, etc., is soooo much more important. 
BabyBumps X What kind of pain? I have had a bit of aching , I just assume it is ligament pain from the uterus stretching. 
BabyBumps X I'm 17 weeks and not showing at all! I figured with my second I would show sooner but still nothing not even a little bump. My MIL thinks its weird but she's not to happy that I haven't gained any weight either. Guess its different with everyone. 
CsectionCentral X My OB told me that if you can wait for an epidural, sometimes labor can go faster.  They also said that your chance of success is heavily dependent upon the reason for your first section.  If you dilated and ended up with a section because of the baby, you have a better chance of having a successful VBAC.  I never dilated the first time, so my chances weren't great, but I wanted to try.  My doctors were very supportive.
TwoXChromosomes X I absolutely agree. I just really think a person's decision should be well thought out.   My pregnancy was a total accident. I had just started college, we had just gotten married and we had no idea what we should do about the pregnancy. I am *so* happy we went to planned parenthood and got what I felt was an unbiased counselor to discuss our options with us in an open, non-judgmental setting. I felt it was very helpful and I wish everyone could experience that. She started by stating that our options were abortion, adoption, or keeping the baby and asking which options we wished to discuss. We decided on abortion and keeping the baby since I didn't think I could handle an adoption. So she explained to us in detail what our options were for healthcare (I wasn't covered at the time) if I kept the pregnancy and assistance afterward. She also discussed abortion procedures with us and where we would have to go for that and what we might expect to pay. It was early in the pregnancy, so it would have been a chemically induced abortion. In the end we opted to keep the baby. But I just can't say how happy I was to have a mediator between my husband and I who really weren't thinking soundly in the flurry of emotion that is an unplanned pregnancy. 
BabyBumps X I had no real morning sickness to speak of.  In the first trimester there were what I considered 5 bad days total.  I didn't actually throw up, but I had nausea.  And my nausea wasn't all that bad either, I could still somewhat eat on those days.  The only times I have actually thrown up this pregnancy I was either sick, my gag reflex acted up (like brushing my tongue or swallowed something wrong), and one night of throwing up from a migraine.  I'm 31 weeks pregnant with a perfectly healthy little girl.  Up until the late 20 weeks my only real complaints were fatigue and increase in trips to the bathroom, with occasional hip pains which were pretty well taken care of with chiropractic care. While the increase in hormones can cause symptoms, such as morning sickness, it does not mean it will.  You can have a perfectly healthy and successful pregnancy with little to no symptoms.
BabyBumps X I hope you don't have morning sickness!!!   But mine didn't really kick in until 8 weeks. So you may be in for the sickness yet!!
CsectionCentral X This is something I didn't know (about dilating being a better chance of VBAC). I can't imagine the frustration of going through labor for hours &amp; hours to find out you didn't dilate. Dud the dr say why dilation didn't progress?
CsectionCentral X Is there ways to find things like small tears before hand like in ultrasounds? How scary was it for you to know had you gone through vaginal delivery that it may have been resulted in rupture? Sorry for all the questions lol. One more... Will you have more kids &amp; if so knowing how it went both times would you schedule a cs or try vba2c?
TwoXChromosomes X It IS the same thing. The pro-abortion feminists at Jezebel are saying pregnant women should be allowed to kill their babies because they are terminally ill, not because they have already died.   A "severely malformed" baby will still be a live birth. It might not live for much longer, but it'll still be born alive. (A baby in untero is alive from the moment of conception).  A stillborn is a baby who has died in utero. There's a difference between killing something because it won't live for long, and extracting an already dead being from the body. 
BabyBumps X It's super difficult to wait!  I keep wanting a reason to have a ultrasound and check on my girl.  I also had 3 in the first half and nothing since the anatomy scan :-( 
TwoXChromosomes X That is exactly what I experienced as well.  They even gave me a hard time about pumping - basically saying that I wasn't bonding with my son since I was feeding him my breast milk from a bottle.
TwoXChromosomes X I actually like the idea, but hear me out.  We all know breast is best, even the formula companies say so in their marketing brochures.  I can't speak for other hospitals but where I gave birth, formula was given out like candy.  Breast feeding isn't easy for some women, but with persistence, it can be done.  However, if formula is shoved in your face during your stay in hospital (like it was in mine) I can see how an already exhausted, first time mother might just give in and give up on breast feeding.  I managed to breast feed my girl for a month - then my breast milk dried up (medical reasons) and I switched to formula.  This initiative isn't telling people to stop formula feeding, it's just stopping hospitals from shoving formula down mother's throats.  That is something I can get behind.    At the end of the day it's the mother's choice.
CsectionCentral X Let me know when you do, if you remember. I had an all-natural Hypnobabies up until pushing labor then emergency CS too!
TwoXChromosomes X I wasn't able to breastfeed my son - I pumped milk for him for 3 weeks, then formula-fed him.  He is a smart, funny, healthy, happy little boy.  Don't let anyone make you feel bad for doing what is best for your child.  Breast milk is obviously best, but formula is a fine option.
TwoXChromosomes X Old- not cared for well/ protected from the sun, etc. Lubrication- I'm allergic to spermicide in certain condoms so I swell up and it's bad. Also, like uwwu said, not enough lubrication would make it easier to break (too much friction), wrong size, and roughness. 
Parenting X my son was born at 29 weeks and is doing great.  he's 16 months now  did you have any complications? 
BabyBumps X In pregnancy especially your body doesn't always absorb iron like it should whether naturally or through supplements (though any dr will yell you food is better). My iron is fairly low right now and I have a high chance of blood transfusion after I have the baby. I've been on rx iron and taking with vit c and my body still isn't absorbing right. My hemo is right around a 8.8-9 so I guess its not low enough yet to meed iv.
BabyBumps X Yep, I had minimal morning sickness but I still say the first trimester was the hardest. I remember crying because nothing tasted good. I remember not feeling pregnant but still not being able to drink etc. And being paranoid about everything that could go wrong. I hated knowing nothing about the life that I was growing. So yeah, in my opinion, it all gets better from here. Except sex. Enjoy sex as much as you can pre-3rd trimester. That gets tricky.
BabyBumps X My iron has been low my whole pregnancy. OB had me increase iron in my diet and add an iron supplement but I guess my body isn't absorbing the iron anyway. They said that my iron level keeps getting lower and lower despite what I'm doing so this is why they have to bypass my digestive system and send the iron straight to where it is needed.
CsectionCentral X I didn't have a VBAC, I want to.  I have to wait 2 years (first daughter is only 5 months, she was an emergency c-section I want to give it time for healing and so my kids are a little bit apart in age too).  If you go to the AMA you can ask about a VBAC attempt gone to 2nd c-section.  She may be more help on how things are when things don't go as planned either time.
BabyBumps X I do not envy you. I may find myself where you are soon though.   I get the membrane sweep tomorrow and if no labor Thursday... I get the NST.   WHY ARE ALL OUR BABIES STUCK!?!?   IS IT THESE DAMN BUMPBOARDS?!?!??!??!  WHAT ARE THEY PUTTING IN OUR WATER?!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!
BabyBumps X If I did my last two wouldn't have been born at 41w6d and 42w, just shy of my scheduled induction.  I cannot tell you anything that will make you feel better, I'm sorry.  But I will say, baby has always come shortly after I hit a point where I just say "you know what? I'm still pregnant. Oh well." and within 24 hours, labor starts.  But I cant force that feeling... It has to happen on its own. Forcing it just causes more anxiety.
BabyBumps X This is awesome.  Especially because women who can't breastfeed for whatever reason still has access to all that... But a woman who really wants to breastfeed that has problems is more likely to turn to that free formula than consult a lactation expert to help her out because it's already there.
BabyBumps X I told my husband he had up until our youngest son was 30 days old to find adequate research as to why he SHOULD be- I provided a ton for why he should be intact. Not just about how he will get made fun of (rates continue to change here in the US) or how he will look different than him (all penises look different). Until they are able to retract it on their own, you clean it just like a finger.  We have one circumcised son and one intact son. Our choices were supported by our pediatrician and the midwife (who also has circumcised and intact sons).
CsectionCentral X If my labor is at all indicative of how footling breech labor feels, it doesn't hurt at all! (Except when baby is turning from vertex to breech.) But I assume my labor was comfortable due to my Hypnobabies practice more so than his positioning. In addition to breech, he was posterior.
BabyBumps X Yes, I really believe hospitals push formula. I'm sorry you were treated that way by your nurses and doctor. Choosing how to feed your child is your decision.   I wanted to breastfeed with all my children, but had inverted nipples which made it very, very hard to do. The nurses in my hospital didn't give me time to try and work out my latch issues before they supplemented my daughter w/o even asking me (they took her for a bath and feed her formula while they had her away from me). This then began a battle with nipple confusion where she wouldn't nurse unless I was wearing a nipple shield.   Hopefully the hospitals not pushing formula as much will give women like me more help and support. Although, it shouldn't take away from women like you who choose to use formula.  Edit to add: All my deliveries were at the same hospital in less than 4 years (yes...3 babies in less than 4 years!). That was almost 6 years ago...so things may have changed. I'll be delivering there again this time and will find out if they still seem to push formula as much as they once did. Although, I'm much older and wiser this time around and will hopefully be able to make my voice heard more on the breastfeeding issue. 
TwoXChromosomes X My sister had the same issue with the nurses at the hospital when she chose to use formula because of issues with a previous breast reduction.  They tried guilting her into breastfeeding even though she couldn't.  Luckily she had done her research and sufficiently pushed back enough that they gave up and let her do what she wanted.
BabyBumps X Effacement is the thinning/softening of the cervix, getting it all prepared to dilate (open) and let the baby's head through.  It's part of the first stages of labor!  Sometimes it happens very fast and labor starts quickly, and sometimes you can sit at a 2-3cm (meaning the cervix has opened about 3 cm) for weeks before anything happens.  But it is a start!
BabyBumps X I didn't get any cans of formula from my hospital.  They did send us home with some extra because I was having supply issues but nothing in a swag bag.  I think this experience is very different from hospital to hospital.
BabyBumps X "I have told him (after everything i have read) that we should get a butt plug and play with it to make things easier and less painful, but for some reason he thinks buying a butplug unnecessary. "  It's not unnecessary but it's not necessary either.  My husband and I had anal sex quite often for a while as I was told I couldn't have regular sex after I had a cerclage placed.  Use lots of lube, start with a finger and then if you have a dildo or something try that.  The most important thing is that you be comfortable!  Go SLOW.    We stopped because my orgasms might have been causing my cervix to shorten.  Boo for no sex.  
AskWomen X No, never. I would find it kinda gross and I'm fairly sure I pee more than I bleed for the most part so I don't think it would absorb it all. Plus it probably wouldn't have the time I'd imagine to absorb all the liquid before it starts to.. overflow.
TwoXChromosomes X Sounds like you're sorted out, OP. But I do want to contribute that, yes, depo provera gave me awful acne. It was also just an awful birth control for a multitude of other reasons, but a month on low hormone pill BC has got my acne almost entirely under control. I think I'll be back to normal in another month.
BabyBumps X I get two throughout my pregnancy - the first is a viability ultrasound usually done around 8-11 weeks (if you're unsure of the date of conception, they'll also date it then), and then the anatomy scan done around 20 weeks. From what I hear, most doctors do two; a select few will only do one, though.
TwoXChromosomes X It's also nice that my husband gets to feed her, too. I think it's good for their bonding (though I was eventually planning on this happening with expressed breast milk when I went back to work).   I can take good medication for my PPD now and not have to worry about the baby getting it, too. Of course it is arguable that my PPD is as bad as it is now because I can't breastfeed, so go figure. 
BabyBumps X Yeah, it amazed me that she wanted to have a natural birth, yet was at a hospital with a regular OBGYN. She lived in LA, surely there were better options. 
TwoXChromosomes X Haha I've had like a million pregnancy scares. The last one was one that I was 21 days late. Turns out I had just been so stressed that it was delayed. It COULD be pregnancy but it could also be a bunch of things or it could be nothing. In any case go to your gyno. Sometimes bodies are just weird.
TwoXChromosomes X It sounds to me like she may have [endometriosis]( ). She should be seen by a gynecologist, who can diagnose and treat the condition via laparoscopy. 
BabyBumps X Reading this thread has been so cathartic for me. Being ok with gaining weight has been my number 1 stress so far this pregnancy. I was in Weight Watchers when I got pregnant and was at my lowest weight since middle school... While I know it's normal and healthy to gain weight for this baby, it's quite the mindfuck sometimes too.   Hang in there and listen to these ladies-- such good advice in here!
Parenting X I can't even figure out what your argument is for circumcision.  Circumcision is not part of the culture in my country so I don't see any reason to do it. In my opinion its purely cosmetic.
beyondthebump X I had an epidural, and it was THE BEST. My labor was complicated and the epidural allowed me to relax enough that I went from 4 cm to 10 cm in an hour. I was able to catch a little sleep and prepare for pushing. Baby got 9s on all his APGARs and latched like a champ. He had no issues whatsoever, and I had zero complications from the epidural. Every woman is different, and every labor is different. Don't feel pressured to labor one way or another. Do what feels right for you and you can't go wrong!
BabyBumps X Congratulations!!! Feb 17 is my mom's birthday :) My due date is Jan 27, but all babies in my family are born late so I'm secretly hoping for a birthday present for grandma-to-be :) 
TwoXChromosomes X I've been on the Nuvaring for like 6 years and love it.  it's more convenient than the pill for me. It has a lower dosage of hormones than the pill so has less side effects. My boobs grew a whole cup size too yay
beyondthebump X An ounce combined is pretty good at 4 weeks!  I found middle of the night my breasts were engorged and it was a good time to pump (except for the need-to-sleep thing).  But if you find they are full in the morning, go for it then.
BabyBumps X I don't even remember my 2nd trimester! I was just reading stuff today and it said (and of course the weeks are different depending on what site you are on) that 27 weeks is the 3rd trimester. Heck yea! :)  I feel great on most days. I've had a great pregnancy so far. I'm just always tired. Hoping the nesting urge comes soon so I can start working on my house instead of having my husband do all the hard work LOL. Oh, and sleep is very little lately...the bump gets in the way too much. Even with a body pillow it doesn't help and then I wake up sore as heck because I moved the wrong way too many times throughout the night trying to get comfortable.   But 3 months left and my baby girl will be here so I think I can deal with the uncomfortable sleep for a little longer :)
BabyBumps X I'm going to play it by ear. All that a rigid birth plan does is create anxiety if you have to deviate from it. I plan to do everything I can to go natural but I also want a labor experience that is enjoyable and safe for baby and I. I plan to accept pain meds if I feel that I hit a wall and am too exhausted to go on and last resort, worst case scenario get an epidural only in an extreme circumstance. I labored for 20 slow moving hours, totally paralyzed with an epidural last time and absolutely hated it.
BabyBumps X Did you actually get tested for it? Sometimes bacterial vaginosis can seem like a yeast infection, but requires other treatment.  Also, if you are still having sex, you should have him treated for it as well or he could just keep giving it back to you.
BabyBumps X I did not want to be bed ridden either. So, I got my epidural at the last possible moment. I only had to wait about an hour before baby was born after that.
TwoXChromosomes X Right now I am looking into the non hormonal IUD called ParaGuard. My gyno &amp; I consider it to be the best option for me right now. And a having good relationship/trust with your gynecologist is key. Do some asking with your girlfriends to see who they go to &amp; what their experiences are with different forms of birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X Yes.  There are hundreds of pills with different formulas, there is the ring, the patch, hormonal and non-hormonal IUDs, and the implant.  Edit: _contraception  So if you've noticed any changes in mood and what not, your wife might want to look into a different type of BC.  I personally can only handle the Nuvaring, though I haven't tried the implant.
BabyBumps X Oh that's what that means!!  Sorry :).  They got me to 3cm with Cervidil before my water broke.  I hope you go into labor naturally soon!!
BabyBumps X I've made a little list! But my midwife said I won't need a lot so to pack light! So my list has now gone bye bye and I'm thinking the essentials. So pjs, maternity pads, toiletries, slippers, nipple cream and breast pads, bra's, baby stuff( blanket, clothes, vests etc) and then probably phone chargers and something for my SO! 
TwoXChromosomes X yeah, it's very interesting the range of emotions that accompany this.  even though it's a choice, it's not an easy one.  i'm surprised it took 3 weeks to get you in for an appointment...?    i'm sorry your friends and family weren't supportive.  i imagine that made it a LOT worse.  i've been really really careful about who i've told, because even ONE person who told me babies are a gift really made it harder on me.  i needed it to just be my own decision.  good luck with your emotional recovery.
BabyBumps X Ummm, how frequent are your BH hun?  If you're 31 weeks they shouldn't be increasing in intensity. The general rule is if you have more than 4 in an hour, especially if they don't stop from pushing water and laying on your left side, you should get a call in to your doc.  I have Irritable Uterus my rule has changed to 4 intense BH in an hour.  But if the intensity has been increasing throughout the day I might get a call in.  ETA- especially since they're that painful.  They really shouldn't be making it hard to breathe.
BabyBumps X Congratulations! Mine did blood tests at 3w5d (to see if I was pregnant) and 4w (to confirm rising hormone levels), then scheduled a 6 1/2w ultrasound. I've been so nervous about this one because it basically shows if the pregnancy is viable and if you have more than one. We've got another ultrasound in 2 weeks then we're being turned over the the OB.  Good luck on twins if that's what you want! I didn't know until today that I wanted it. I guess things have a funny way of working out. Also, good luck on the early symptoms, for me the morning sickness has been killer.
TwoXChromosomes X I got sore very quickly even with lube. I also seemed to be balancing a never ending problem with either yeast or bacterial infections. 
BabyBumps X I had some morning sickness early on that was fairly brutal, but weeks 14-37 (where I am now) have been WONDERFUL so far. I often forget I'm even pregnant. :)
TwoXChromosomes X It's a good idea to be above board with your lovers about having herpes, but as far as it impacts your health or your ability to have healthy sex, it's not really a big deal.  The stigma of herpes is dramatically out of proportion to its realities.  In reality, it's mostly an annoyance, as long as you are responsible about it.  The likelihood of transmitting the infection while the infection is dormant is near impossible.  So if you don't have sex while you're feeling an outbreak coming on or during an outbreak, all your lovers should remain uninfected.    The bonus of having a genital herpes infection, rather than oral, is that most people experience very few outbreaks.  Oral herpes tends to recur more frequently.  And the bonus of having any herpes infection at any of the possible sites, which are oral/nasal, genital/anal, fingers, and eyes (with RARE exception), is that infection of another site, even with another strain, is greatly reduced due to antibodies.  Furthermore, by adulthood, most people have one of the herpes viruses, even if they are asymptomatic carriers, so lots of lovers will be protected without even knowing they are.  The primary health risk associated with genital/anal herpes is an increased risk of HIV infection, which is really only present during an outbreak due to having an open sore.  So if you don't have sex while you have an open sore, which you shouldn't do anyway, your risk is essentially the same as anybody else's.  The only herpes infection that is potentially dangerous to overall health is occular (infection of the eyes), because it can, under certain unfortunate circumstances, cause vision loss.  So if you have another outbreak, which may never happen, don't touch your junk and then your eyes, and you're good.  FYI: I have oral/nasal herpes; it's merely annoying; it's led me to do oodles of research, hence my knowledge on the subject of all manifestations of herpes; and as far as I know, I've never passed it on to the hundreds of folk I've kissed or sucked or fucked since my initial infection.  So just be above board and safe, and you're good.
TwoXChromosomes X The judgments in this thread are upsetting. We obviously have a seriously dysfunctional relationship with sex in this country. The people who have unwanted pregnancies are also the ones with the least access to sex education, the least access to birth control, the least information in general.
TwoXChromosomes X Mine talked about her yardwork and took a swab. She used something afterwards that was very slippery. The speculum will feel funny but it's over pretty quick. All in all the anticipation is worse than the checkup.
TwoXChromosomes X Go ahead and get an exam. There are a lot of things that can be problematic with ladybits, so it's best to start early, get yourself comfortable with going in for an annual exam. It's good to take care of yourself &amp; know that you're healthy down there!
BabyBumps X I find it's easier to just come and complain when I need to as an outlet so I don't drive my hubby and friends nuts.  There are often times I've considered posting how great and content I've felt and how much energy I have on a certain day and realize that in a room full of hormonal women it might not go over well.  First trimester was really rough for me- in some ways rougher than the previous ones. I was sick all day, but hardly ever vomited. I had heartburn, migraines, and morning sickness though that left me physically drained. Thankfully it went away about 12 weeks. In my prior pregnancies, I had really bad back pain, but I haven't really had any this time. It's been pretty easy since first trimester got over even with dealing with mild gestational diabetes.
BabyBumps X MY pregnancy has been easy by definition.  Awesome first trimester (NO sickness, mild boob soreness, not terribly exhausted), great second trimester (more energy, no boob soreness), and my third has even been good (still feel good, sleeping well, not peeing too much, no swelling)!        But at this point, I'm just kind of...*over* it, yanno?  I wrote a post about how I dislike being pregnant, but I think it came from two things 1) a shitty day 2) lack of autonomy.  And coming here to bitch and moan to people who empathize and are in the same boat is WORLDS better than bitching to people in real life who just *don't get it* and looking like a Negative Nancy. 
Parenting X &gt;Male circumcision was never meant to do this  Just one article for you, I'm at work: _of_male_circumcision#Male_circumcision_to_prevent_masturbation  &gt;Male circumcision, when done correctly, does not. And what happens when it isn't done correctly? You cannot believe that there are never problems.  Lastly, I don't under why people don't allow their boys to choose for themselves when they got older, the way we do with other body modification. If my son wanted to get circumcised for whatever reason when he grew up I would support it, because he is making the decision for his body.
CsectionCentral X Oh! As far as labor pains go.... With my first, my water broke first, then when contractions started they felt like bad period or diarrhea cramps.  They were totally manageable, and I went something like 12 hours before considering an epidural.  But with the second,  it started as an intense uncomfortable pressure, and rapidly (by the time i got to hospital) devolved into hellish pain -- I was having to focus on a little LED in the exam room, breathe through them, etc, and I have a pretty high pain tolerance.  I think it was only so painful because baby was transverse, though, so don't let that scare you! 
AskWomen X In a monogamous relationship where both partners have gotten checked out for sexually transmitted anything and are both clear, and both partners don't go out and sleep with other people, using the pill/shot or using the pull out method properly is a good enough method for birth control.  If a person has multiple partners, has sex casually, or goes through boyfriends/girlfriends like underwear, then a condom is effective as both birth control and STI prevention.
Parenting X see response to JoustingTimberflake  &gt;Male circumcision, when done correctly, does not. And what happens when it isn't done correctly? You cannot believe that there are never problems.  by that reasoning we should never do anything that has any possibility of causing an issue.    we chose to do this for boys at birth because largely because men would elect not to do it at an older age, even though there are health benefits not only for them, but for women as well.  people seem to forget that male circumcision benefits the health of WOMEN too 
BabyBumps X Are you sure it isn't a bug? I've had morning sickness this whole time, my best friend is pregnant at the same time and thought she had morning sickness but it turned out to be a virus that lasted a week. Either way, real coca colas  always make me feel better. 
TwoXChromosomes X Somewhat tangential  One of the times I visited my doctor, she told me that they no longer test young women for HPV.  I asked her why, and she told me that if it turns out positive, the next natural step is to do a biopsy of a cervix.  This involves physically removing a part of the cervix and can later cause complications during pregnancy (such as premature birth).  But typically your body flushes HPV out on its own over time (while you're young), and so often it'll clear up, and the biopsy was a waste.  It's not concerning until later in life when your risk of cervical cancer becomes more serious.  But HPV is just one of many reasons to see a gynecologist.  If  you're sexually active, you should be having regular check ups once a year.
BabyBumps X Give your doc a call.  If you are starting to dilate they might be able to place a stitch (cerclage) in your cervix to keep it closed.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;The [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]( _And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Adolescent_Health_Care/The_Initial_Reproductive_Health_Visit) (ACOG, 2004) recommends that young women have a complete physical exam that includes a pelvic exam with a pap smear, by age 21 unless they are sexually active. For sexually active women, this exam is recommended approximately three years after the first sexual encounter no matter what age that occurred. -[Source]( -for-women-childrens-health/medical-services/gynecology/the-well-woman-exam/#who)
TwoXChromosomes X This.  I almost can't believe she advised you in that manner.  If you tested positive fo HPT you should definitely be seen annually.  It can lead to genital warts/polyps that can lead to cancer.  
Parenting X I started taking a prenatal vitamin and living a healthy lifestyle before starting to try. Used the fertility friend app on my iPhone to track my fertile times for the first two months, then in the third month I added tracking my basal body temperature. Turned out my fertile period was a few days after my cycle suggested it should be, so doing BBM did the trick and we conceived on our third month of trying! Plus I was almost 35 at the time. Conceiving isn't hard for everyone, good luck to you!   
TwoXChromosomes X People experience different symptoms with UTIs. For me I felt like I always had to pee -- and when I did it smelled like ham (ham is forever ruined for me). Get it checked out as soon as you can, if it's a UTI it could damage your kidneys to let it go for so long. Otherwise it could be an infection, sometimes chlamydia has similar symptoms to a UTI ( this is what the doctor told me, luckily I just had a UTI and my problems were solved without a gyno exam! ). 
BabyBumps X Is your groin swollen? *hugs* in general though. A pulled groin muscle isn't fun! It happened to me during my last pregnancy at around 34 weeks. My doctor just told me to stay off me feet, take a bath and let it heal itself :( 
TwoXChromosomes X Also if you have an itch, weird smell or discharge coming from your lady bits that's not normal for you, do not be afraid to go see a doctor.  I made an assumption that an itch and dry skin down there was a yeast infection and turns out it was Vaginitis which is something I do not wish upon anyone. 
CsectionCentral X I don't blame you at all, my first birth ended up as an emergency cesarean after stalled labour @ 42 weeks. I was in friggin AGONY, full dosage of Pitocin and stuck at 8-9cm for hoooooours. I only had an epidural for an hour or two as it actually *fell out*. I was starting to second guess my decision to have a repeat cesarean this time around, until I had a labour scare and ended up in the hospital with contractions at 30w5d. Everyone handles their labour &amp; birth differently so I can only speak for myself-- but as far as this bitch goes, contractions HURT. Screw that. :(
TwoXChromosomes X It would definitely depend on how both my partner and I would feel at the time, but thinking about it now, I would probably look to adoption as an option. Raising a child is a huge responsibility and having no warning or time to prepare would be a very difficult situation to be in.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, not really planning on giving anyone else blowjobs ever again.   But even before I was in a monogamous relationship, I was well aware of STD risks and took lots of precautions.  The only person I have ever been with willfully is my husband. He had only been with one other person one other time and got tested afterward and came out clean. We're both at pretty low risk, so I am looking forward to lots of barrier free sex without being paranoid of babies in my future. 
BabyBumps X If it makes you feel any better I didn't hear a pop. I went a few hours thinking I'd become incontinent. I had a very strong bag though, it broke on top on its own but they still had to break the frontal bag (nearly a day later) to get things moving.
BabyBumps X I had a touch of nausea at 6 weeks and it went away by week 7. However, for the last three days it's ramped up. I puked for the first time last night. While I'm luckier than many, I didn't miss it completely.
TwoXChromosomes X Really? That is so awful then! However, I have an IUD and I highly suggest it! I just got it about 6 weeks ago (Paragard - no hormones, which would probably be a great choice from you). I posted about my experience, if you want to check it out [here]( _my_paragard_iud_today_heres_my_experience/). It was pretty painful, but it's so easy now! You can have spotting for a few months (which I am experiencing), but not dealing with taking a pill everyday and not pumping my body full of hormones has been FANTASTIC. Good luck!
BabyBumps X It seems to be so far (apart from the epic cold/virus I got last week!) I honestly feel fine 90% of the time except I'm really tired and since the 2nd tri began I now need the toilet like a trooper!   I was worried too as mostly everyone else I could see had epic sickness and sore boobs and peeing non stop, I was petrified until I actually had the scan and only then I started to chill out a little (I'm a natural born worrier though, and as you know from TFAB, I was dying for this to happen!)   I guess we're both just lucky with the lack of symptoms :) x
AskWomen X Damn I wish I had had this advice when my friend had her multiple miscarriages and then found out she couldn't get pregnant again (she already had a daughter).  I didn't do a lot of the Don'ts, but I now know why she hated it when I kept going on about how she should try again and because babies can happen, etc. 
BabyBumps X Technically, you SHOULD be able to tell the sex by 16 weeks on a regular ultrasound. I had my anatomy scan today (18 weeks), but I already knew at 16 weeks what the sex was after asking an U/S Tech friend of mine to take an early peek.  Some techs out there don't like to dole out the verdict that soon, but you might be able to find one that will....so maybe a cheaper ordinary ultrasound is something you can look into for before your husband leaves :)  
AskWomen X She was talking it's width while hard, with the length of her pinkie (so like 1.5 inch dick... that is indeed small).    The moral of the story was don't walk around bragging about a huge dick to compensate for your little one.  
BabyBumps X I keep having dreams of a baby girl.  However, in my dreams, I already have 2 boys (my first was a boy), so I don't know what to make of it.  Some ladies tell me that they dreamed the gender of their baby before they found out.  I say their dreams have a 50% chance of being right.
TwoXChromosomes X American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises your first pap smear at 21 (even if you're not sexually active). They used to recommend that you have your first pap smear 3 years after you first have sex if that happens to fall before your 21st birthday, but studies have shown that significant cervical dysplasia (that doesn't go away on its own) starts after age 21.    Now is a good time to look into getting the HPV vaccine, however that is something your regular doctor can do. I had the series of 3 shots and no side effects. If you are concerned about medical problems in your vagina, such as pain or irregular periods, a gynecologist would be better.
BabyBumps X For fun, I've noticed two things about baby Leo: when i lay on my back, i can feel him scoot right up into my ribs until i can't breathe. Little brat lol. But then i get him back by tickling his feet when he pokes them out of the side of my belly, and he squirms and kicks when i do that :D
BabyBumps X I loved my sonoline b. I used it two pregnancies, then towards the end of my last found out someone very close to me got pregnant after 4 years of trying and sent it to them... I think I was almost half as excited as they were when they told me they found it the first time (and I was *very* excited)
TwoXChromosomes X Like bahhamburger said, **please see if you can get the HPV vaccine.** It's three shots that are given over several months (I think about six?) and the majority of women and girls have no side effects. You'll probably find some bad stories about it on 2X, but please keep in mind those represent a *very* small percentage of the people who get it. It reduces your chances of getting cervical cancer by protecting you from about 80% of the different types of HPV strains.     It's important that you get this done before you become sexually active (probably before having oral sex as well - there are strains of HPV that could be passed this way, even if your partner is asymptotic) because otherwise it will offer you no protection. Men can carry HPV but are often not as susceptible to it as women (IIRC, can't totally remember the validity of that) and it's common for them to show no symptoms. To further complicate things *there is currently no way to test if a man is a carrier,* so you have to make sure you're taking precautions. Condoms help (btw, use condoms! :P) but won't protect you from all strains of HPV.     Also your dad sounds pretty cool, but I imagine there are things he thinks are common knowledge that you don't know. So keep asking questions! 2XC, [r/twoxsex]( ), and [r/askwomen]( ) are all good resources if there is a topic you'd rather not discuss with your father.     I would type more but I think this is enough wall-of-text for now :)
TwoXChromosomes X My doctor says first Pap smear at 21; this was recently revised, because of the HPV shots.   First gyno exam is different. You should see a gyno if you are already sexually active, or intend to become sexually active. My OB/GYN recommends that even if you are not sexually active, you have your first visit the summer before you start your freshman year in college.  What that visit entails will depend on your personal situation. It will not include a pap smear since you're not 21 yet. In fact, it may not include any pelvic exam at all -- just peeing in the cup, blood pressure, weight, and the rest is a simple "get to know you" visit, so you know you have a doctor to turn to should you become sexually active in college. 
TwoXChromosomes X I got lucky and had an amazing doctor after I started getting UTIs with my current bf.  She was totally understanding and supportive.  She suggested cranberry tablets and a HUGE glass of water after having sex.  Every time.  And when this didn't work flawlessly, she gave me a prescription for antibiotics, and told me to take one pill with my cranberry and water, again, only after sex.  She said that getting a UTI makes you prone to getting another, and my experience agrees.  So keeping yourself UTI-free for like 6 months with antibiotics (I'm not a fan of drugs, but this is worth it!) will make it possible to go without the antibiotics in the future.  Also, I've found that drinking lots of lemon water, instead of regular water, helps.  And for the same reason, getting potassium citrate capsules and taking those with water when you feel something possibly coming on also seems to help quite a bit.  They also help with the burning, and even the discomfort associated with the cranberry pills, by making your urine more basic.  Besides being more comfortable for you, basic urine makes it harder for bacteria to thrive.
TwoXChromosomes X Pee right after you have sex. It flushes the urethra and gets any bacteria that may find its way in there out. :) I had a bad UTI after my first time with my second partner, and my friend/coworker gave me that advice and I've never had an issue since!
TwoXChromosomes X I'm just curious, what about in a situation where the woman was on birth control, using condoms, etc, but for whatever reason their method of protection failed?
TwoXChromosomes X Had my copper IUD for about 3 months now and I love it. The insertion wasn't bad at all. It was uncomfortable but very quick. My cramps have been worse, but they aren't crippling and they get better with every cycle so far. 
TwoXChromosomes X A lot of women have a mental block on it. I was with an older, more experienced guy who actually taught me how to have orgasms from intercourse alone. The trick for me was to clear my mind and focus on exactly how the sex felt, and to think about the pleasure growing with every thrust. The key for me was not to think about orgasm at all or I'd intimidate myself into not getting off.  When you masturbate, how are you positioned? You might have trained your body to only orgasm when in a certain position. I have the opposite problem from you, actually, that I can only get off if I'm on the bottom, and I think it's because I always masturbate on my back or stomach.
TwoXChromosomes X My doctor doesn't need to do a pap to give me birth control :). But since I'm on Family planning I have to have one yearly for their records or something.  I didn't realize the recommendations have changed, but I definitely don't agree with them at all. I think pap smears should be done at 18, and when a person first becomes sexually active. There's things that a pap can catch that other tests wouldn't. I know a few girls that had cervical cancer and it would have been almost to late to catch if they had waited until 21 to have their first pap. Mine keep coming back abnormal so I go in more frequently than most. 
TwoXChromosomes X My cousin had three of her kids via IVF because they said it was impossible for her and her husband to get pregnant on their own.  One year after the twins....She got pregnant 'accidentally' because she had been told it was near impossible for them to concieve on their own so they did not bother with contraceptives.  
TwoXChromosomes X It doesn't. Either ending a life is murder or it's not. If someone is a criminal and they cannot be trusted to live in the public and it is decided that they should be terminated- is it murder? If a woman doesn't want to become a mother and has a doctor remove the group of cells that would eventually become a baby - is it murder? Either one may be for the greater good, why is one okay and the other not?
beyondthebump X I have a family history of bloodclots. My midwife and doctors informed me that the period after giving birth = higher hormones, which means higher chance of clotting. So I would suggest taking a baby aspirin daily, and if you have any other symptoms (or family history of blood clots), to go get checked out. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have a copper one and I am not going to lie... it hurt like a bitch to get put in and the next month was painful! But now its all evened out and I 100% happy with it! :)
BabyBumps X First seven weeks were amazing! I felt great, glowing with the best secret. I found out at four weeks and floated on air for three weeks. Come week 8, I ended up going to the ER because of intense dehydration and vomiting! Turns out I got hyperemesis gravidarum, a rare but hardcore form of morning sickness. Around week 18 it ceased, and I have mostly good days since then! Point is not to scare you, but rather that it's pretty common to feel okay wet first, even when your hormones are gearing up to smack you upside the head! Hope your pregnancy goes smoother than mine! :)
BabyBumps X I think low iron levels is a fairly common occurrence. My hematocrit was just barely below the average/ideal range. My OB just suggested taking additional iron pills (1-2 pills a day), even though my prenatal vitamins also contain iron. I took it for awhile, then stopped because I was noticing some bowel issues, as I'm sure you can guess. But I'm still eating foods high in iron. My OB said that they usually like to see higher iron levels because a lot of blood will be lost during/after labor &amp; delivery, so it would be best to supplement now.  Don't worry too much about it. It's not that bad.  Definitely do talk with your OB to see what they suggest.
BabyBumps X ok do not get a prenatal with higher iron level.  It's not going to help because prenatals have calcium.  Calcium hinders the absorption of iron.  What you want to do is take an iron supplement and not at the same time you take your prenatals.  You'll absorb more of it this way.  Also taking it with orange juice is a good idea (make sure it isn't one that includes extra calcium) because vitamin C helps with the absorption as well.  Also green vegetables are iron filled (like spinach and broccoli) and it's an excuse to eat more steak :)  edit: to help with constipation try the ferrous gluconate because it's easier on your stomach or you can try the liquid forms.  It's not perfect and may still constipate you a bit but not quite as bad as the other.  Also you should know that it could turn your poo green so don't freak out if you have green poo as that's normal.
TwoXChromosomes X I know everyone's already suggested peeing/washing after sex, and keep doing that. My doctor said while there is no solid evidence for cranberry helping to prevent UTIs, he personally believes it can help. Cranberry juice won't cut it, take a concentrated pill supplement daily. Maybe try buying online if they seem expensive in stores. Also it won't help once you've GOT a UTI, but they do apparently work on prevention.   Edit: also avoid caffeine and sugary drinks while you've got a UTI, stick to water. 
BabyBumps X That's about the same symptoms I had at 5 weeks. I didn't get morning (all-day...) sickness until 7-8 weeks. Fatigue arrived at around the same time. Congratulations again! 
TwoXChromosomes X I switched to the Nuvaring and found I had less side effects than with oral contraceptives.  A lot of gynecologists are recommending it for women who have had severe reactions with the pill.  I tried 6 different oral contraceptives and either gained weight or had severe mood swings.  I feel pretty balanced now and have not experienced weight gain.  Talk to your doctor about switching to another type of birth control.  It might be the dosage, or you might want to try something like the Nuvaring, or go a completely different route and try an IUD (those have some serious risks).
TwoXChromosomes X I just got a Mirena iud two weeks ago. I was pretty freaked but I literally had the easiest insertion ever. I took ibuprofen before and my doctor would only do it when I was on my period so I was naturally more dilated. Took like 2 mins and felt like an uncomfortable-ish cramp. I've had very few cramps since, no spotting, and only some extra discharge. I think I'm an atypical case from everything I've read but the doctors weren't surprised it wasn't bad.  Edit: I'm 24 and have never been pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X Pills with estrogen don't work very well for me. My favorite one is a progestin only pill, although you have to be *very* careful with it. If you forget to take it within 3 hours, you'll need to use a backup for of birthcontrol for a week.
BabyBumps X I had zero symptoms until week 10 and I just dry heaved one time and had zero appetite. First pregnancy here too. 18 weeks and still don't feel pregnant, haha
BabyBumps X Very common. My hips still bother me now but buying a body pillow helped. I sleep with it between my knees. I can tell when my hips are going to start bothering me because they start tingling. Now I'm dealing with this with my arms...pregnancy induced carpel tunnel. If I sleep on my sides my arms fall asleep and hurt BAD from shoulder to fingers. Definitely not fun. 
AskWomen X If my child was breastfed exclusively and didn't have any expressed milk handy, sure. 
AskWomen X If I was unable to breastfeed, I would try to get breast milk donated to me. There are many organizations that donate their extra breast milk for mothers who are unable to produce. I think it is amazing. I would not however, want another woman actually breast feed my child. That is a bond meant for mother and child. Imo. I would not give up the bond my son and I have from it now for anything.
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah, and at first it may poke you in the vagina when you sit down / move around. It will soften with time, however. And if you have no particular reason to have the string cut very short, ask them to leave a bit of length, allowing it to curl up nicely by your cervix.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm up to four who've no-goed the IUD, and seven who've refused a permanent option.
AskWomen X By "slime" do you mean vaginal discharge other than natural sexual lubrication?  Vaginal discharge is 100% normal depending on the color/texture/time of the month.  Vagina's excrete liquids daily as part of our body's natural maintenance- though anything extremely thick and colored other than white/off-white/clear can be a symptom of an issue.  Also, different women have different smells- you might find some more welcoming than others.  I don't know what to say about the "dead skin" not having seen it myself.  I'm not sure if you should bring it up, but since she's a virgin it's totally appropriate to encourage her to see a gynecologist- who would notice if something was wrong.
AskWomen X Sometimes natural vaginal discharge that occurs throughout the day can have a thick consistency... but as far as the the rest of the description, I have no idea what you're talking about. 
beyondthebump X haha yeah it was pretty bad I had relief from an epidural for about 3 hours then it wore off. So that pretty much sucked. Plus I had Pitocin and contractions were hell after that!
beyondthebump X &gt;dealing with SPD for 6 months  How long does that take to recover from? I don't know if I had SPD, but my hip started hurting while I was pregnant. Now, almost 4 months later, I still can't walk much before I hurt pretty bad. Sucks!
BabyBumps X When I saw an OB, I went from monthly to every 2 weeks about that same time. My homebirth midwife I saw every 3 weeks and then switched at 31 weeks to every two weeks this time. (I asked her if we could go do that instead of starting 2 weekers sooner since things were fine. Ended up going to 32 weeks since she had to reschedule.) Started weekly a couple weeks ago. Same schedule as last time almost. 
BabyBumps X My co-worker/friend went in at 40 weeks, 3 days and they were going to induce her. She went into labor before that and they kept bullying her into the epidural. They kept saying she was running out of time to get it so she caved in and got it. Only half her body numbed and the numb part got really bad shakes/chills. She pushed and pushed for hours and they finally told her she'd need a C-section. She said the next time around, she wants to go as natural as possible because she felt cheated of the birthing process. :(
beyondthebump X [Very first photo]( )  This was taken only minutes after I'd given birth. I had labored for 46 hours, pushed for 6 minutes on a birth stool and was immediately moved to bed for skin to skin while the chord pulsed down. My husband and I were enamored with our new little girl.
AskWomen X Um, hell no. Wearing pads are uncomfortable. I'm sure wearing a diaper wouldn't be much better.   I have a diva cup for a reason. 
BabyBumps X I had dollar tree tests when we were TTC. That's what I got my first positive on. I followed up with a digital after the positive. 
BabyBumps X My OB did an ultrasound during my first appointment.  I was about 8 weeks.  Had to do it transvaginal though, because the baby was too small to pick up a heartbeat via ordinary U/S.  But it was awesome to get to hear it and see the baby so soon!  So it depends on your doc :)
AskWomen X It's really hard to "lose" a tampon inside you since most tampons + their strings are longer in length than the average vagina when a woman isn't aroused.  
BabyBumps X Mine has the hiccups at least once a day for many weeks now.  Sometimes he hits my hips, once near my stomach, but most low in my abdomen.
TwoXChromosomes X A close friend of mine had exactly these symptoms (frequency/urgency of urination and itchiness which would occasionally subside for a couple days, but then come back... all over the course of a month or so) with an absolutely 100% clean urinalysis. She finally went to her gyno and was diagnosed with [bacterial vaginosis]( _vaginosis). This is not exactly a disease, per se, just an imbalance in the natural vaginal flora. A week (or was it three days...?) of oral antibiotics and she was fine.  Since it's an imbalance of bacterial flora, I'd say any number of things could cause it. If you are sexually active, it could be anything from a new partner to a new brand of condoms to just pure bad luck. If not, I'd guess you can get it from contact with a public toilet? (The inside of your underwear brushes up against something by accident, picks up some stowaways, and then applies them to your vagina.)
BabyBumps X This Thursday!! I can't believe you are already having your baby... I just realized I've been on this board for *11 weeks*!!  crazy!    I can't wait to wake up and see your post one morning :)  
Parenting X Bottom line, you're too young to raise a child. You're both still children yourselves. you'll miss out o a huge swathe of your young life bringing up a child and you or your partner or both of you will probably end up resenting each other.  You'll need a huge swathe of support and help from your parents to do this. In fact they should end up being the proxy parents for some time to allow you to finish your studies, get a job to support the family and put a roof over your heads. In short, if your parents can't or won't help significantly you'll have a hell of a struggle. Even if they can, you'll have a difficult time from here on in.  Realistically, abortion or adoption should not be thrown out of the mix when making a decision at this stage.
Parenting X I'm going to play devil's advocate here. I understand you want to keep this baby but are you sure about that? Talk that over as a couple with your parents and hers. This is a hell of a burden for a couple of early teenagers. You really do have a long life ahead of you to prepare for something like this and as it is right now, you won't be financially supporting this child, your parents will and they may not be able to do so reasonably.
Parenting X Please consider abortion or adoption.  You're 15.  You're not equipped to raise a child.  You couldn't get birth control right, how are you going to raise a child successfully?  Please consider why abortion and adoption are off the table?  Are you trying to do the right thing?  How is a 15 year old raising a child in our society the right thing.  I had my first when I was 21 and i' positive it was still too early.  PM me if you need to talk about this.
beyondthebump X I started feeling better in stages.  Immediately after birth, the reflux was gone and I didn't have to get up 12 times a night to pee.  A lot of the random aches and pains were gone, too ans I was able to sleep normally again.  (as normally as a newborn will let you sleep)  I had a 3rd degree tear and it took about 2 weeks for the lady parts to heal up and feel normal again.  The weird thing is, I never had hip pain while I was pregnant but now my hips are achey.  I guess it's just everything moving back in to place, but it's kind of annoying.  Hopefully that will go away soon.
TwoXChromosomes X Huh?  UTERINE contractions help the CERVIX dialate.  (Which is, I'm quite sure, where you're getting "cervical contractions" from.)  Absolutely nothing "dialates" the vagina in any way, shape, or form.  The cervix gets large enough for the baby to pass through, and the stretchy elastic nature of the vagina stretches for the baby to get out.  This is exactly the same as sex.  Vaginas are stretchy and widen when something is in it.  Cervixes only widen when a baby is coming out or if a doctor gives you a shot to dialate it for some other reason.  Cervixes and vaginas are not the same thing.
TwoXChromosomes X Get this checked out with your doctor.  I had very similar symptoms right before my PCOS diagnosis.
AskWomen X It's common for most American men to be circed.  But many parents choose not to circ these days, so most little babies, toddlers, and young boys are intact.
BabyBumps X Last night my husband spooned up behind me and said, "Was that her?!" I hadn't even felt it, but she apparently kicked his stomach through my back. Mine loves to punch my cervix. At least she's not kicking my rib that my shingles run down anymore. :/ 
TwoXChromosomes X You may have [Polycystic Ovary Syndrome \(PCOS\)]( _ovary_syndrome). It's thought to affect 5-10% of women. *PCOS is the leading cause of subfertility and infertility so it's not something to be taken lightly if you want to have kids in the future.*  If you have quite a few of the symptoms go to the doctor. You'll have to have a blood test to check your hormone levels and a vaginal ultrasound to check for cysts.  If it is PCOS hormonal birth control is actually a good method of controlling the symptoms - it regulates your hormone levels eliminating most problems and prevents further cysts from forming. Some lucky women even lose the cysts they had before BC (I'm one).  Long term treatment depends on your particular form of PCOS. If you have insulin resistance Metmorfin is a good choice but has no beneficial effect (just side effects :( ) if you're in the sizable minority of women without insulin resistance. If you are overweight losing weight is the best long term option. Low glycemic index/carb diet often helps regardless of weight.  Don't look down on (or let your mother scoff at) hormonal treatment just because it has a contraceptive side effect. A lot of drugs have much worse side effects, this is a very benign one! Your health is at stake here, there is no such thing as an amoral drug, just amoral people.
BabyBumps X From what I've read and gathered from asking my doctor and others, if one chooses to get an epidural, it's best to wait as long as possible or at least until 5cm because the anesthesia can sometimes stall labor.  I have absolutely no idea what I'm getting myself into so my plan was to just labor for as long as I felt that I could naturally and then ask for an epidural if I feel the need to. If I don't feel like I need it, then I won't get it. If I want the relief, then I'll get it. Simple as that! 
BabyBumps X My bump is small too, people are surprised right now when I tell them I'm due on the 20th.  No one even started noticing or commenting on my pregnancy til I was about 30 weeks along I'd say.  It'll show up. 
BabyBumps X I know the only reason my 8-week ultrasound was done transvaginally was because I just didn't have a full enough bladder for the tech to see anything using the external transducer. I would assume my 20-week one will be external, providing they can get a good enough view.
AskWomen X If you guys regularly use manual foreplay you might be fine. Does she masturbate at all? Or use larger tampons? I found my first time didn't hurt and was very enjoyable. It can be if you take your time and are truly trying to be comfortable. 
BabyBumps X Popcorn feelings at week 12..  I started feeling slight flutters at week 14, it was few and far between and felt like something was sliding down my belly from the inside. It got kinda stronger this week, but again, it's not constant.  I'm not 100% sure it's baby, but I'm fairly positive it is.  I am very much ready for full fledged kicks though. :)
BabyBumps X Me too. Only recently do I have a noticeable bump and even then, it's much smaller than other women who are similarly far along in pregnancy. Kinda sad about it since I only have a few more weeks left and I feel like I didn't experience a big part of pregnancy. I'm jealous of these perfectly round, protruding baby bumps!
BabyBumps X I had my first ultrasound between 8 and 9 weeks. Baby looked like a frog (ultrasound tech was not amused by me insisting it looked like a frog :P) , so we called him/her "Frogger" for the first little bit. A few weeks later I got a picture and frogger now looks like a turtle! I'm sure its clearly a baby, boy or girl by now!
BabyBumps X You could write that you would like minimal intervention, you would like to labour with the help of your (doula? Birth coach? SO?) only unless it becomes medically necessary to do otherwise.
TwoXChromosomes X Please get your thyroid levels checked, this sounds like it could be hypothyroidism. These are also potentially symptoms of depression. Always important to think about what else it could be, besides the pill.
BabyBumps X Ugh. Could not get back to sleep after a 3:45am pee. The worst part is my legs &amp; feet aching even after sleeping or resting with them elevated. Come on, baby, any time now! 
BabyBumps X You look lovely! I remember when I was pregnant with my first I got asked that all the time! And people thought I was due "any day" from about 5 months! Wear that bump proudly!
BabyBumps X Just wanted to let you know not to give up hope that your every minute of every day sickness could end at any time. For me, I went to bed nauseous, woke up the next morning and it was gone. For good. I still had serious food aversions that continued to make me feel sick but the general nausea went away just like that!  Here's hoping tomorrow is a better day!  
TwoXChromosomes X Oh don't get me wrong, I am not against abortions at all.   I just think she could of been more responsible about her reproduction health.  I understand that life gives people unexpected situations but I at least hope she is on some form of birth control now. 
BabyBumps X The only real pregnancy book I read through was Dad's Guide to Pregnancy for Dummies because my SO bought it and wanted me to read it and tell him the important parts :P I enjoyed it a lot more than the other books I got.
TwoXChromosomes X On the planned parenthood website it says "Of 100 couples who use the symptothermal method correctly for one year, 0.4 (fewer than one) will have a pregnancy." Wikipedia says "several studies have found actual failure rates of 2-3% per year." It can go much higher than that (up to 25%) but from what I've read it seems like those studies include people who knowingly had completely unprotected sex during the time they knew was the most fertile. 
BabyBumps X "Kicks" are not always the baby kicking you with his foot. It could be a hand, an elbow, a butt, a head, or any other extremity. And baby can move move more than 1 limb at a time.
TwoXChromosomes X Some women manage to get pregnant on two forms of birth control. Other women can't get pregnant for years after stopping birth control.
TwoXChromosomes X i would just like to say that i am probably one of the most adamantly pro-choice people i know.. but i don't think that an abortion is something to be taken lightly. i completely support this woman's decision, and in her position i would have probably made the same choice. however, her nonchalance about the situation was pretty unsettling. once you become pregnant and become attached to a child that you created.. it's kind of hard (for me) to look at abortion as "just a medical procedure."  that being said, everyone has their own way of coping with things, and this was hers. i just thought i'd share why a story like this might make some people uncomfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X I apologize for thinking you knew she had a second abortion. So let me try to get this straight: You thought she was not being responsible for her reproductive health because she wasn't using birth control and then got an abortion? I still don't get how that is not being responsible for her reproductive health. She made the decision not to use birth control, obviously knowing she would be absolutely fine with having an abortion if she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant, and had an abortion. She doesn't seem to have a problem with it, and her reproductive health seems fine (doesn't seem like she had any complications). So all I'm really seeing is that you are making the judgment based on your personal beliefs that it was irresponsible for her not to use birth control, even though she was apparently well aware of the possible outcome and dealt with it in a way that doesn't seem to be having a huge negative effect on her life.  I think it's pretty damn responsible to have a safe, legal procedure done instead of having an unwanted child, regardless of whether or not she was on birth control at the time of conception.
TwoXChromosomes X the first time I had sex it wasn't painful. But I was incredibly wet from half an hour to an hour of foreplay. sex has hurt maybe once or twice because there wasn't enough lubrication.  Definitely make sure she is wet enough.
TwoXChromosomes X There are potential side effects with any option. Some women hate the Depo shot, some women love it. You don't know how your body will react until you try it. But it may shrink your areas of endo, so it may be worth taking a chance on, to you.
Parenting X This is fantastic. I was lucky enough to find an amazing midwife who owns her own birthing center. She was on call 24/7 and if she was out of town, there was a second midwife to take her place. Best decision of my life. 
AskWomen X The equivalent to male circumcision in a female is the removal of the clitoral hood. Some people have had this done voluntarily as adults - I think I saw a Cosmo article from the 90s that talked about it. But removal of just the clitoral hood happens relatively rarely in comparison to more dangerous/traumatic practices: removal/cauterization of the clitoris, removal of the labia minora, or removal of most of the vulva creating a hard scar with a small hole that must be re-opened for intercourse or childbirth. It's definitely not the same thing as circumcision.
AskWomen X &gt;It's definitely not the same thing as circumcision.  But I believe it has the same underlining principles:  1. The removal of pleasure.  2. The lack of choice (though for FGM it is extremely forced). 3. The cultural bias of what "looks" aesthetically pleasing.  4. A source of power and/or money.    I agree that it is not the same practice, it is worse, but male circumcision and FGM share these common traits.  Sometimes people will spin that FGM is not at all the same in order to justify the legality of male circumcision, which isn't right either. 
AskWomen X Come on, unprotected sex is not the smartest thing...if remaining unpregnant is what you want. You're always supposed to take pregnancy tests in the morning, because your urine has remained in your bladder for a longer time/less movement, etc.  Go to a doctor. Get birth control if you're not pregnant. Or at least use some condoms/spermicides. Know that condoms can break and spermicides are less effective than condoms.  Double up on birth control methods in order not worry about getting pregnant.
BabyBumps X You came to the right place!  Yeah healthy babies!!!!!  That first trimester is so stressful so it's soooooooo exciting to hear that everything they can check for so far looks good.  I love reading bumpers so excited about their babies... I've been pretty giddy myself :)  Everyone reacts differently and sometimes I feel like a big ball of squeels every time I read about other women's pregnancy updates lol.  I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
TwoXChromosomes X I really, really recommend it if you are monogamous or want a backup birth control method.  If you look up recent articles on the IUD, you'll see it's often called the "forgotten" birth control method because hormonal methods are "easier". But it has 1/10th the failure rate of BCP, lasts for at least 5 years, is human error-proof and fertility comes back when you take it out. If you get the copper IUD (like me), you don't get hormonal interference.  Downsides: It's only really good for monogamous folk, because STD's are more likely to travel up the string and cause worse problems in the uterus, apparently. The boyfriend can sometimes (like 1 out of every 30-40 times) feel the string. It's uncommon, but the IUD can move out of place or perforate your uterus. Insertion is uncomfortable + a few seconds of outright pain, and at least some cramping (in my experience).  I weighed my downsides/upsides, and it comes out really positive.  My sister uses the Nuvaring and it seems like so much trouble...
BabyBumps X The dressage made my day! I'm a week short of starting my third trimester and feel the same way. I felt like this most of first trimester... Sleepy tired sleepy... It's all coming back now! 
TwoXChromosomes X So suppose my boss rapes me... Obliviously that is a criminal act and a felony, can I still take the company to civil court and file a tort for sexual harassment based on that incident?   
TwoXChromosomes X well... no issues that you've noticed. i'm sure you've flushed tampons in public places or other peoples' homes and apartments. and while yours alone probably didn't cause any calls to plumbers, a pile of them certainly would, in a place with narrow pipes, etc...
BabyBumps X I started taking Nature Made Prenatal Multi + DHA (the big bottle from Costco) before I got pregnant and was trying to conceive. Once I was pregnant, those were making me very very nauseous. My doctor said she gets tons of free samples of prescription prenatals, and that I could try different ones to see which ones I liked best.  Prefera OB-One prenatals didn't make me sick at all. It is just one pill that has both DHA and the vitamin in it. So I've been taking those throughout my pregnancy. My insurance doesn't cover the prescription so I just get more from my doctor every time I have an appointment. 
BabyBumps X I think my husband is just really excited.  Plus, he wants to take two weeks off from work RIGHT NOW, but is going to wait until baby comes... so he's secretly hoping I go into labor soon.
BabyBumps X I'm so excited for you! I'm a little over 19 weeks as well with a boy! When is your due date?!
BabyBumps X The newest thing my little one does is when I try to go to the bathroom, she jams her feet up into my ribs and pushes her head down as hard as she can, like she's thinking "Oh, you're pushing??  Is it time for me to come out now??"  It's so freaking uncomfortable.  I dread trying to poop now.
BabyBumps X new chapter organics perfect prenatal. At $70 a trimester, its not cheap. but they dont hurt my tummy, and have folate, which is a lot more absorbable.
TwoXChromosomes X Lucky you. Here in the US it's a luxury if you get two weeks paid time off and three sick days, and many companies strongly encourage you to NOT take it but cash it in at the end of the year instead.
BabyBumps X Super cute bump! Only 5 weeks to go? That makes us pretty close for dates. I'm a thin girl too, but my bump is HUGE. Maybe it's just big to me? Lol 
BabyBumps X Yup, I'm pretty newly diagnosed but have suspected it for years.  Nice to know others are around! Just trying to lose the weight in preparation for TTC, when we're ready.  Metformin has been a godsend in that regard.  It really scares me sometimes that PCOS could stop me from getting pregnant :(
CsectionCentral X Spinals work faster, are a set level of anesthetic (epidurals can be turned up or down because it's a flow of medicine), no tube remains in your back and they have a set time limit-epidurals can be topped up.   Spinals are slightly riskier I believe (though both are low risk overall)? I had a spinal with my EMCS and I also vomited, had the shivers/shakes, wasn't allowed out of bed and had a catheter in for 24 hours. I don't think any of that is solely because of the pain relief, but rather the emergency c-section aspect.
TwoXChromosomes X I've had mine for almost 6 months now, and I love it.   Some pain with insertion, but nothing worse than bad cramps.   Best part? I haven't had a period since the day I got it. :)))
AskWomen X Cranberry pills are better than cranberry juice, and take 3-4 times the amount they recommend, and drink an absurd amount of water. If that doesn't clear it out within a couple of days tops, or if it gets worse in that time period, definitely see a doctor. And then stay on cranberry pills regularly to keep it from happening again.
TwoXChromosomes X I would suggest once this situation is over with that you find an alternative form of birth control that does not depend on you remembering on an everyday basis. If you have not had any issues with the hormones I would look into something like nuvaring or possibly the implant or mirena.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, the unprotected sex was technically both weeks. It was just week 2 that I had missed the pills.
TwoXChromosomes X I don't think your sister's argument is wrong.  She is entitled to her opinion, and you really have to respect that.   Abortion is a moral issue. Some people, myself and your sister included, believe that abortion is *actually killing a baby.* Even if the baby is just a bunch of cells, it is still human, it is still a child. Therefore abortion, in all its forms, is murder. It is morally repugnant.   I wish that we lived in a world where abortion wasn't necessary. Where pregnant women could get all the help they needed. Where sexual education was taught thoroughly everywhere. Where contraceptives were easily available, affordable, and reliable. Where women weren't raped.  I do recognize the necessity of abortions for dangerous or non-viable pregnancies. I am completely against late-term abortions, except in the cases of dangerous or non-viable pregnancies.   I also believe your sister's argument that the only way to 100% not get pregnant is abstinence. Of course women want sex. I want sex. However, I know that when I have sex, if I get pregnant, I can handle the situation. I use contraception so I don't get pregnant. I do know the risk that I could still get pregnant. Any woman (who has been educated enough to know what sex is the number one cause of pregnancy) knows that if she has sex, she could get pregnant. Any man knows that if he has sex with a woman, she could get pregnant. You are liable for your own pregnancy. If you 100% don't want to get pregnant, don't have sex. If you're willing to take the risk, however small, that you may get pregnant, by all means have sex. But if you do get pregnant and you come to me for advice, then don't get angry at me if I tell you I am against aborting.   The only reason I want legal, accessible abortions is so women don't die from botched abortions. I do have some pity for women who accidentally get pregnant and can't afford it. I don't want legal abortions so it can be a form of secondary birth control. Personally I am very much against aborting a viable pregnancy.
AskWomen X Has she ever been to a gyno?   I'm not sure if irregular periods is something to be worried about. I know several healthy women who have irregular periods. However, the constant bleeding sounds odd to me. Any hormonal bc? Is she taking any medications?   
BabyBumps X Sperm does help soften the cervix. But remember you can be effaced and dilated weeks before she comes! Unfortunately there  are very few signs that labor is imminent. Just relax and baby will come when s/he is ready:)
TwoXChromosomes X This is obviously a HUGE decision, but I think the best approach is to simply ask yourself "which would you regret more, having the baby or not?"   Then, do what you need to do to make that decision easier (i.e. having an abortion or looking into how you could make it financially feasible to have a child). 
AskWomen X &gt; Reproduction, however, obviously works differently in the two genders.  It may, but I don't see any politicians trying to ban vasectomies or Viagara, which would be the male analogue to banning abortion or birth control for women.  &gt; whereas reproductive health affects the mother, the father, and the baby, so it's a lot more complicated.  It does not affect the biological father at all unless he is the one carrying the pregnancy (which has never happened in recorded history).  It also cannot affect "the baby", as there is no baby until birth occurs. A human being is not a single living entity but a vast system of interdependent entities. Your cells are not "humans" because they are not a complete system and therefore violate the basic definition of what a human is in biological terms. An embryo, likewise, also violates the definition and is likewise not a baby.  Calling an embryo a baby is like calling an acorn a mighty oak tree.
BabyBumps X Yeah, don't laugh, but when I go into labor, I CAN'T STAND ANYTHING on my body.  It happened with the first and it was such an odd feeling.  It wasn't an option, I just couldn't stand anything on me during the final stage of labor.  With my second, it was so fast, I was actually still dressed (lol - she was a one "pushing" contraction baby - delivered by the nurse &amp; anesthesialogist).  LOL  But my third... had to be naked again.  Very embarassing after the fact, but it was cumpulsive at the time (and with this one I had no meds, so it couldn't have been a reaction.)
BabyBumps X You should feel your baby kick at least 6 times within 2 hours. If not you may need to get an ultrasound.. try walking around, having some juice or lying completely still, to feel the babe.
TwoXChromosomes X Legally yes, adoption might get complicated. Emotionally, all options are difficult. If he knows she's pregnant, then he'll have to know about an abortion. I mean, he'll figure it out eventually.   I'm all for whatever OP decides to do. I am posting about adoption as a possibility in case OP's guilt was revolving around terminating the pregnancy as opposed to raising the child.   This is going to be tough for their relationship no matter what happens. I'm less concerned about controversy in this thread than OP coming to a decision that she can live with.
AskWomen X Definitely pleasure (or pleasurable pain). Unless it turns into "ow ow ow", then it's not pleasure anymore :p It's sort of controllable for me, but it takes effort and concentration to not moan when things are good... which in that case also removes some of the pleasure.
BabyBumps X It can cause perpetual engorgement, a forceful let-down that can be hard for the baby to handle, and an imbalance in the amount of foremilk and hindmilk the baby gets.  Foremilk comes first.  It is thinner and keeps the baby hydrated.  Hindmilk comes second.  It is thicker and fattier.  If you have too much milk, the baby can fill up on foremilk before the hindmilk starts flowing.
AskWomen X I have heard that those can be quite cold and painful.  Then again though something about a finger in my butthole I am just no comfortable with haha.  I am waiting on the day when they can just look at you with a special pair of glasses and say "yep your good" and you can go about your business.
TwoXChromosomes X Oh I see! Well, I have never had children, and that was a concern I had but the doctor reassured me that there is only a small chance you can have an ectopic pregnancy (where the egg attaches outside of the uterus, but usually in the Fallopian tube) with the IUD. As long as you remember to remove the IUD professionally before you want to become pregnant, you should be good! Also, mine is good until 2019 or so.  (I have the copper ParaGard, which releases no hormones, but the most popular one called the Mirena, which i think is made of plastic, secretes a small hormone dosage.)   I also read an article where in the long run, they calculated that an IUD was much cheaper than buying other birth control methods, for as low as $4 a month! Crazy! 
TwoXChromosomes X Any of these things isn't a huge risk if you get regular pap smears. A positive HPV pap would mean that you have to get paps done every 6 months until an x amount of regular paps in a row.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm surprised this hasn't been listed yet!! I used to get UTIs once or twice a month for _years_ when I was taking oral birth control pills. On the order of at least 1 a month. Since switching off (to the nuvaring) I have not gotten a single one in more than 4 years.  I do still take daily probiotics and cranberry supplements.
BabyBumps X I just want you to know that my contractions felt nothing like my braxton hicks/menstrual cramps. It was just a pain that kept coming and going away. Start timing them. If the pain gets 5 minutes apart consistently for an hour, call the hospital and go in.
BabyBumps X I do! I've started to get annoyed and a bit grossed out by my shrinking stretching belly button right now, and every time I whine about it, my husband tells me it just looks like a normal belly button. I think this is because I compared it to my dog's asshole one day. 
BabyBumps X I have to agree. Then again I'm from a state where it's slowly being legalized. I don't smoke pot, I don't like it.  However since it is illegal... I get it.
BabyBumps X I really wanted a midwife this time around. I'm hoping for a VBAC and figured a midwife would be my best chance of success. I did my research, and found a midwife that works with a hospital that was recommended to me. After my first 2 visits though I didn't like their policy, well it wasn't so much her policy, but the hospital she was affiliated with. I had to have an epidural because I was a VBAC in case of an emergency, I wouldn't be allowed to go more then 2-3 days overdue-- I decided to find another midwife. I ended up getting referred to an OBGYN by a doula I was looking to hire, and I fell in love with him. IMHO, it doesn't make a huge difference who you decide between the two, you just need to find out that shares your views on birth and you click with.
BabyBumps X I'm an ER doc myself so I've worked with both OBs and midwives in my training, and I love both. But I want my pregnancy to be overseen by an OB and I'd prefer (if possible) that the OB who knows me best be the one to deliver my child. However, the midwives I've worked with are largely excellent and usually have better people skills than the OBs. Luckily after working with both, I knew which OB I wanted and I love-love-love-love-LOVE her. She has all the empathy, care, and skill I wanted. If I ultimately deliver with a midwife (the hospital where I go will have both midwives and OBs available and they work closely together), I'll be happy. Really, as long as I have a healthy baby I'll be happy.  I think the key thing is to find someone with whom you can relate. Someone you can trust. Someone who listens to you. You need to be able to get questions answered. You need to be able to make choices that work for you and your family about the pregnancy, delivery, etc. So ultimately it doesn't matter too much (as long as the OB is available quickly in case something goes wrong during delivery).  I hope you're able to find someone wonderful. Don't stress out about it, though. Maybe ask your current OB for a recommendation for someone similar?
TwoXChromosomes X The pills I did stay on for a long time, the effects never got better. Some had such bad effects that I didn't bother staying on them long enough to find out. My symptoms were mood related. Eventually feeling extremely depressed or extremely angry all the time wasn't worth it. I got a copper IUD which is pretty great so far. 
TwoXChromosomes X What are you taking? Generally the lowest dose pills have the fewest side effects, but if you to too low you may spot or not be protected from pregnancy. I recommend taking the lowest dose of hormones that works for you.   I haven't experienced any mood effects from the pill so I can't answer your question. If it isn't too bad try to stick out - you just have one more month. If things don't get better make sure that the next pill you try has a different progestin compound. 
TwoXChromosomes X The good news about trich is that it doesn't cause serious damage, the bad news is that it is NOT always prevented by condom use and can't be reliably detected in men. I don't think any of the men I've had sex with have even been tested for it.   Trich is an STI. You *had* to have got it from one of your previous partners. This isn't anyone's fault, since it isn't usually tested for in men (and the test sucks), but there really isn't any other way to get it. They all need to get on antibiotics even if they've tested negative. The women they had sex with need to get on antibiotics. If someone is refusing to be tested/treated and blaming it on you... my guess is that that's the guy who gave it to you. People who are stuck up about STDs tend to be the people who don't take precautions and thus acquire them.
BabyBumps X So true!  With my first, I bought all this stuff and had it all ready.  With my fourth, all I have done is bought a package of newborn diapers.  LOL... bad mommy here i guess.  One thing you do need to leave hospitals in my state is a car seat.  Other than that, I think your list is perfect.
BabyBumps X Mine was pretty basic: family medical history, estimated due date, and she gave me a bunch of forms for referrals for ultrasounds and blood tests. I came back a few days later for a blood test to confirm the pregnancy. I haven't had any internal exams apart from a vaginal ultrasound to check the position of my placenta.
BabyBumps X I don't blame you! If I have issues just getting up and down my stairs I doubt I can walk from one side of a store to the other comfortably. I've never been pregnant before, so I'm not used to this lack of mobility. I was waddling and limping at one point because of hip pain lol.   I've been resting until my fiance gets home at 5:45. Unfortunately he has to mow the lawn pretty much as soon as he gets off and it hasn't been mowed in two weeks lol.
BabyBumps X Are they getting more painful? I had this on Tuesday. Woke up with them, went into the office to be monitored they were coming every 10 minutes, then by the afternoon they were every 6-7 minutes, by 10pm they were every 3-4 minutes. They got slightly more uncomfortable, but not what I would consider painful. I called the OB, went in, I was having contractions but they weren't strong enough to do anything. I was there for 4 hours, no change in cervix, they gave me a sleeping pill and then sent me home :(  I hope this is the real deal for you!! But if not, it's a good sign that your body is getting ready =)
CsectionCentral X Labor was... well hard. Every contraction felt like someone was ripping me apart from the insides.. no that's not right. I really can't describe the pain. It was the most intense thing that I have ever felt. My whole body would stiffen and I could not move or breathe. I couldn't even cry out. I was crying silently during them and trying not to scream in between them. I remember thinking things like "How can anyone do this more than once?" and I was told that at one point, during transition, I said that I no longer wanted the baby. I was obviously not in my right mind, but that can kind of show how incredibly hard it was. I wanted it to stop. As hard as it was I didn't ask for an epidural. I brought it up a few times but my fiance always reminded me that I didn't want it and to think about it before we called someone. I didn't get one though. At the beginning of labor the midwife discovered that the baby was "sunny side up" and she wanted to turn him. I got on my hands and knees and she used her hands (one inside and one on my belly) to turn him successfully. That was painful. I was walking around the room and I sat in the shower for about an hour which was a huge help. I also rocked in a rocking chair for a while, and ever sat on the toilet for a bit. From start to finish my hard labor was 4 1/2 hours. I hoped for this, my mother's were the same length.   Everything was going fine up until I got into the tub with the jets. I labored in it for about 30 minutes and they checked me in it. At about 4:45 am or so I was almost at 10 cm, the almost being a small lip in my cervix. I felt the urge to push and told my midwife. After a few contractions with the urge still there I put my legs up and pushed. IT FELT SO GOOD. I mean I didn't want to stop. It was so relieving. Like being incredibly incredibly constipated and finally feeling the urge to go. They had a portable doppler on my belly while I pushed.               
TwoXChromosomes X I use a 7-fold, which is a little different, but here's my strategy:  Fold.  Hold bottom, insert partway.  Push until the rim is just past my pubic bone, at this point the stem is still outside but the whole cup (or almost the whole thing) is inside me.  Pinch the bottom of the cup until it's fully popped open.  Tug on the stem a few times to ensure suction.  Using the stem, push until it finds a comfy spot.    Leak-free every time.  I suppose I can feel when it's not fully open.  I don't feel it at all when it's in right, but if it's not open all the way, it feels uncomfortable.
TwoXChromosomes X Hmm. Your ultrasound was normal but you still have pain? Did they put you on birth control yet? Or Lupron which basically makes you menopausal but is supposed to help wit the symptoms. I had an ultrasound recently that basically showed it (after having similar symptoms as you but way more often) and they put me on birth control. Hopefully that will make it better until I can go in for my laparoscopy (I assume its the surgery that you will go through). Maybe you can try seeing a specialist for it and see what they say about it.
TwoXChromosomes X It depends on where it is located and how bad it is but they are never 100% certain unless they do surgery. My doctor said that because of what came up on the ultrasound and my symptoms that it's basically endometriosis but they want to see how I respond to the bc.  Also, I can't believe their giving you Vicodin! There were times that I couldn't even walk from the pain and all my doctor gave me was advil. Good luck though:)
beyondthebump X I've done two sessions of the c25k program and its going well. Went for a hike with hubby and baby today. My body its starting to feel more normal... before I felt like I was still all belly... but the scale isn't really budging much and I still can't fit into my damn prepregnancy jeans! I know I'm being impatient. I've just got to keep at it.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm on the NuvaRing, and I cycle through my period and insert a new ring every 3 weeks.  Though about every three months I start to spot bleed until I take out the ring and give myself a full period.
BabyBumps X Hey, don't feel like you have to have an epidural just because you get pitocin! I made it through without any pain meds- my nurse was really careful to start the pitocin slow, and back it off when my contractions got super intense. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you want to skip periods with a pill, monophasic is the way to go.  "Periods" (actually just breakthrough bleeding) while on the pill are caused by a drop in hormones.  Biphasic and triphasic pills will have a less extreme drop than the placebos, but are still likely to cause break through bleeding.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on Trisprintec and had issues with spotting as well. My doctor ended up prescribing me a different birth control. 
Parenting X Also I just realized you think an employer pays for it....    The maternity benefit is paid by way of unemployment insurance (the insurance is paid as a part of the government wage deduction)... So you pay for it over time. And by the time you hit family starting age... You more than likely have paid for you first child's maternity benefit.    
TwoXChromosomes X I also suffered from chronic yeast infections and the only thing they helped me was probiotics, specifically femdophilus. 
TwoXChromosomes X A few years ago I woke up one morning with debilitating UTI pain completely out of nowhere, peed blood, no lead up of any kind. As I was without insurance I went to an emergency clinic where they tossed me a prescription to antibiotics and pushed me out the door. No culture was done. I took the antibiotics, and it didn't go away, just got worse. Three more runs of  emergency clinic antibiotics and four years later, I finally had insurance and was tested. I never had a UTI, I had [ureaplasma urealyticum]( _urealyticum). It's a vaginal infection that's almost asymptomatic, but in very rare cases results in bladder inflammation and/or sterility. All of the antibiotics that they gave me attack bacteria by removing its cell membrane, but if there's no bacteria it'll just attack whatever is there, such as the bladder lining. Between the two it was about the worst four years of my life. The infection is gone, and after another two years of carefully watching my diet and supplementing I'm in much better shape, but wow I would not wish that experience on anybody.  **tl;dr:** Always get a culture before taking antibiotics.
BabyBumps X I totally agree. Too many women get hung up on vaginal delivery/no pain mess etc. etc. as the only methods a person should use, and can get rather sanctimonious around those who are willing to admit they may need a c-section, epidural or induction. I think we all want wat's best for our babies and Gould be supportive of each other no matter what th journey. Props to OP for shooting for a vaginal birth if tht's eat she thinks it's best fo her baby AND dethswatch for challenging it as the only option a brave/loving mother would take. 
BabyBumps X *pats on back* There, there. It will all be over soon (the nausea I mean). My sickness lasted until about 14 weeks. I threw up *everything*. Even water. :(
BabyBumps X I started pregnancy around 208lbs. My doc said the same thing to me about what normal weight gain should be for my pregnancy.... The first trimester I didn't gain a lb. Now I am 21 weeks and I've gained about 10lbs just in my second trimester and I'm not even close to being done. You will probably go over your recommended weight but I wouldn't stress too much. This is my third pregnancy and with my second I gained 32lbs. I didn't have any health problems with me or my baby and he's a very healthy 2 yr old. Continue to eat well and I'm sure everything will be fine. 
BabyBumps X I was at 189 (it was a low day) which my doctor counted as my "pre-pregnancy" weight (I was already pregnant).  Now I'm 23 weeks and somewhere around 215.  Sooo... 26 pounds? And I've been watching what I've been eating down to the calorie.  Some people just gain more while others gain less.
TwoXChromosomes X Sometimes "sand" or "gravel" forms in the liver itself, and even after the gallbladder is removed this can lodge in the common bile duct, causing intense pain. It's not common, but it happens.
BabyBumps X Those limitations for us larger ladies are total BS. 20lbs is *ultra* conservative when you take into account the extra blood volume, amniotic fluid, baby, and fat reserves you naturally put on.   Even if you gain 30-35lbs, its not the end of the world. Don't stress it so much. 
TwoXChromosomes X Most women will have a strange period every once in a while. Don't worry about it unless there's a lot of pain or an unusual amount of bleeding. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm told there's a chance that going from the higher hormone levels in week 3 pills straight to the lower hormone levels in week 1 pills can result in "escape ovulation."  I'm not sure why this is different from higher hormone levels in week 3 to no hormones in the placebo week.  When I tried it with a triphasic I did some research, got two packs and tried taking two weeks of week 1, then two weeks of week 2, then two weeks of week 3, which went exactly as well as I mentioned above, but on the plus side, I did not get pregnant either.  Woop woop.
Parenting X Completely agree with you. IF you said from the beginning that you were going to back up your wife's decision no matter what, then when she decided it was time for formula, that was it.  I know our pediatrician was pushy with her when shementioned in one appointment that she waas going to try formula instead of breast feeding.  The doctor basically just said "Well you can try pumping instead of nursing"...didn't even acknowledge the formula as a viable option.    I think whatever the parents decide should be the end of the discussion. It's good to have that extra input from professionals, but I do not like how pushy they can be.
BabyBumps X Unless you are over 35, it is most likely not an amnio. It's probably a blood test, most likely checking for spinal bafidia (sp?). If your numbers weren't high and you're under 35 I don't see any reason why an OB would have you do one. He's probably referring to the blood test, but you can always call and double check. 
BabyBumps X That gives me hope!  The past 3 days my walk has turned into a slow old lady waddle.  SUCKS.  Totally know the "oof" sound getting out of bed lol.  Thanks for the love :)
BabyBumps X I just asked on of the CRNAs I work with and she stated "gas is nitrous oxide and it's bad for the baby and can cause hypoxia. Epidural is safer because none of the local crosses the placenta". I was so hoping our hospital provided that because I'm not getting an epidural unless absolutely necessary. 
BabyBumps X That sounds like what she was referring too. My ob asked us both times if we wanted to. Both times he also told us it wasn't needed, and is not correct every time. He said a lot of people opt for it, and if it's positive, they have an abortion for fear of the hardships. He said 3 of his 6 children tested positive, he and his wife prepared for the worst, and ended up with perfectly normal babies. To imagine the amount of babies aborted over a false-positive astounds me. The risks are also too much for me to chance with my babies. I wouldn't do it, especially since your baby seems fine anyways. 
Parenting X When I had my daughter, I tried to breastfeed.  I saw a lactation counselor.  I tried to pump.  My body physically did not produce enough milk to satisfy the baby, so she would suckle until I bled.  I kept trying for about six weeks, supplemented with formula, until my milk dried up virtually overnight.  I HATED breastfeeding the whole time I was doing it.  I know it's better for the baby, but it freaking HURT.  Not to mention how I didn't feel like a person anymore, just an udder for some parasite to latch on to whenever they felt like it.  I became very resentful of my child and had to be medicated.  You can't bond with your baby over breastfeeding if you're busy resenting the kid!  Not to mention the feelings of guilt for being resentful of your child when you know you shouldn't be.  My husband wanted me to continue breastfeeding anyway, but he wasn't helping with any of the work, and I had to go back to work after my six weeks off.    Skin-to-skin touch while bottle feeding can still be rewarding for both mother and baby.  After switching to formula entirely and being treated for post-partum depression, I didn't feel as hateful toward my offspring.  I love her to pieces, I just wasn't prepared for the vacuum of sheer *need* that infants have.
BabyBumps X Definitely could be! With my first I felt it at 17 weeks, I thought it felt like a fish sort of swimming in there/a tickle like you described, but I didn't feel anything again until around 19/20 weeks, when they become more obvious. This pregnancy I started feeling at 16 weeks, and maybe because I knew what it felt like, they were distinct kicking. 
TwoXChromosomes X Rice (not the microwave kind) in a sock.  Put it in the microwave for 45 seconds.  Instant heating pad. 
BabyBumps X I was 19 weeks and a few days and it felt like popcorn popping in my belly :)
TwoXChromosomes X I have a doctors appoint this week to get a new prescription for my birth control and was thinking about switching from the pill.  Are you able to skip periods with Nuvaring?  I take my pills for 3 months at a time so I only have my period 4 times a year.  Are you able to do that with this?
BabyBumps X I'm jealous :/ My doctor is letting my go until September and I'm due tomorrow. But lucky you and I hope labor happens on it's own very soon! 
BabyBumps X I've still been doing a weekly photo, and [22 weeks]( ) is at the bottom of the page.  I'm really curious now to see how I go in a few weeks, because my uterus is so high (but measuring only slightly bigger).  Once it runs out of space to go up, does it go outwards faster instead?
BabyBumps X I lost 13 pounds by my second trimester, although my doctor had it recorded as about 8 since I lost some weight before my first visit.  It wasn't from throwing up either, and I was eating more than enough.  I was a tad overweight to begin with (160 pre pregnancy, at 5'1) so I think my body just wanted to readjust some of the weight to better support pregnancy, because I started gaining steadily since about 23 weeks.  I'm now up to 165ish as of last Thursday. Generally your body will do what it needs to do.  If you're not starving yourself I really wouldn't be too concerned.
BabyBumps X My doctor scared me into induction with my last baby. I was in labor for 39 hours, they broke my water too early, i developed a uterine infection, she got stuck, they gave me an episiotomy and used forceps to get her out. She was in the nicu for 5 days. In those 5 days, they moved the iv (for antibiotics) to 4 different spots; they drew lots of blood, and I had to formula feed because I was too stressed to make my own milk; and she had to be wrapped in a billi-blanket for jaundice.   Also, my mother-in-law was told to get induced because my husband was estimated to be 11 lbs. He was only 7 lbs 2 oz. The weight is always a rough estimate. My doctors never even tried to guess my daughter's weight, and so far they haven't with this one either.   My doctor is wanting to schedule a c-section for me, and I refuse. I refuse to have an induction also. I want the baby to come when she is ready, not when it's convenient for my doctor. He didn't even deliver my last because I went almost 2 days longer than he thought I would. 
BabyBumps X I lost 13 lbs in the first half of my pregnancy I've put back on most of it now (I'm 33 weeks). I had an appointment today and in the last 2 weeks I haven't gained a oz.  doctor asked if the babies moving and if I'm feeling ok but otherwise wasn't concerned.  In my experience many ppl lose in the first tri due to morning sickness and food aversion.  Unless your doctor can tell you specifically why they are worried I wouldn't worry.     BTW I'm not over weight and lost weight in early pregnancy but am totally healthy here in the home stretch 
Parenting X Honestly, you just sound selfish to me. You're not ready to have a child? Well if she chooses to keep it, you're going to be a father whether you're ready for it or not. You made a person, and you need to remember that; it's not just a mistake you made that you can forget about and it will go away. You should take responsibility in some way. I understand that you can't be there physically, but to completely ignore the child would be wrong. Sorry to be so blunt, and I'm sure there are people here who disagree, but it's just my opinion. Step up, help support the baby financially at the very least, and don't make that child grow up wondering why he or she isn't good enough for you.
BabyBumps X I wouldn't worry. I lost 25 in the first trimester and still haven't gained it all back. 
BabyBumps X At 13 weeks, the baby kept kicking while my midwife was listening on the Doppler .My midwife kept saying "did you feel that?" but I thought she was pressing more or something! She assured me it was baby kicks-I had no idea you could feel them so early!   The best way to describe feeling it otherwise is like feeling a goldfish move in a bag full of water. I found putting my hand on the outside of my tummy helped me feel movement as well. 
BabyBumps X My advice? Do something everyday to take your mind off pregnancy, baby, and impending labor. Over thinking everything is exhausting and, the reality is, we won't have much more baby free time anyway. So let's enjoy it while we can. :D
BabyBumps X How do you know if you have a tipped uterus? I've always had a mini bump below my belly button - I jokingly called it my "baby protector" before I got pregnant and just recently realized that it could be a tipped uterus and no amount of situps would have made it go away. Lol. Would my midwife have told me I have a tipped uterus?
BabyBumps X Ah lucky! I wanted them to do it last week, but I was only 1cm dilated and they couldn't do it :/ I hope you go into labor right after the sweep!!
Parenting X Come to Quebec, Canada :)   We all have 1 year, half of it is paid at 70% of our salary and the other half is paid 50%. Father gets 5 weeks, paid 70%
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using a DivaCup for about two years now and I LOVE it. No more cotton-crotch and no more leaking for me.  Taking it out is messy the first month or two until you get used to it, but I can take it out without spilling anything now. If I'm at home I rinse it out in the bathroom sink; if I'm out and about, I dump the contents in the toilet and then wipe it out with TP. Getting it in and out is easy for me, but I do have a relatively short vaginal canal (I can touch my cervix with my fingertips without much trouble).  In what way does it seem risky to you? Maybe I can help address your concerns more directly. :)
TwoXChromosomes X I was using the Diva Cup for a long time. I could never master how to discreetly empty the cup in a public restroom on long 15 hour days where I never see a private bathroom. The first day of my period is always the heaviest, so I fill up the cup in 5 hours. Unless I'm in my house, it sucks walking around with a full cup. Not only that, women's restrooms suck because of all the judgment and paranoia. Also, I couldn't keep it from leaking at night? I've spent weeks and months practicing proper insertion and researching, but I still leaked. I've gone back to tampons and underwear liners and I couldn't be happier to destroy the environment. (I'm kidding on destroying the environment of course)
CsectionCentral X I actually wouldn't say they are way more dangerous if the person delivering the baby is experienced with them and is aware of the (minimal) risks.  That's why in Canada they've recently updated the [guidelines on breech births]( -20090617a_e.asp).  In my case, the fact that my water broke before labour started, and that the baby wasn't descending (and hence not getting labour going) meant that a c-section was suggested.  We had planned ahead of time that if the baby didn't descend we'd accept that advice, though I was really hoping we wouldn't have to.  And thanks, things did end up well in the end! :)
CsectionCentral X Well I guess I should qualify my original statement by saying it *does* depend on what kind of breach presentation it is. Presenting with an arm, or an arm and a leg can be a pretty dangerous.   I narrowly avoided a c-section. My baby was in the head-down position. But I had been induced and after nearly thirty hours, I was having regular contractions but my cervix was less thana centimeter dilated. So I had to be manually dilated, and then the baby had really broad shoulders and got stuck. We ended up having to use vacuum assistance and we got her out at last. 
BabyBumps X I get 6 weeks of paid maternity leave. Not every company is like this, but most do have policies that they discuss with their employees when hired. Government jobs get a month I believe (probably more actually) But because there are so many independently owned companies the policy varies.  If you are working at a company like Burger King or Walmart (chain variety of business) I think you don't get paid maternity leave which is a reason I believe women should strive for education beyond high school and get a job in a place that does have paid maternity leave PLUS insurance and such.   I'm not sure where these numbers are coming from but a lot of friends and family got the minimum time of at least 4 weeks paid maternity leave after the baby was born. A lot of male friends/family got a week or two paid maternity leave as well as their wife.  
BabyBumps X Depends on where u live and what kinda work you do.  I've got no paid leave :-( yah for working a per diem job (I only get paid for the days in in my office, no sick time or leave) 
BabyBumps X I read somewhere that morning sickness is more prone to multiples pregnancy. Basically, the sicker you are the more likely you are to have multiples. If you're only having one this time, maybe it won't be so bad?  (I'm also feeling quite terrible and got sick for the first time yesterday. No fun. No fun, at all.)
TwoXChromosomes X Just so you know, Soft cups and Diva cups aren't the same thing. Soft cups are disposable and Diva cups last for years. 
BabyBumps X I was scared of vomiting ESP people knowing or seeing I was sick pre-pregnancy (on the verge of emetaphobia).  Then the morning sickness hit like a truck when I got pregnant.  Now I just want to heave to feel better and could care less if a coworker walks into the bathroom because I feel TOO bad to care.  
BabyBumps X I am Canadian! I will be attaching 2 weeks of sick leave before my mat leave begins and my employer also tops up my mat leave pay.
Parenting X Not sure if you are a dad of mom but from my experience as a dad it's fairly normal to feel that way as you have no real connection to the un born baby yet.  Trust me when the baby is born you will feel that connection.  Don't be worried this is normal.   Hope that helps. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had an abortion a few years before I got mine. The mirena made me just as nuts as any other hormonal birth control, so if the pill, shot or patch fuck you up, so will this.  I have a paraguard now, been happy with it. the first two months I bled like a volcano but after that everything has been just fine.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm definitely taking baby steps :p tampons just stated to get uncomfortable and pads make me feel like I'm wearing a diaper. Not to mention I've always had ridiculously heavy periods, and there's always the fear of embarrassing leaks. I just wish I could use with soft cup and pee without it dislodging and leaking!
TwoXChromosomes X 20 when I got it, never been pregnant before. My doctor warned me that some patients find the insertion incredibly painful, but she did a lot to try to prevent mine from being so. It was inserted on my period, I was given a pill to stick up the night before that would also dilate it, and she gave me numbing shots in my cervix too.  Couple that with the fact I also just apparently have not much sensation in my cervix, and my IUD insertion wasn't painful at all. Slightly uncomfortable is probably more of the right word. Kind of like a prolonged pap smear with some very mild cramping.  I've had it for about two years and I love it. I have the Mirena, and I've stopped having periods altogether. When I was on the pill I could feel it messing with my libido and my wetness, and I've gotten both back since switching. It just feels more natural, as weird as it sounds.
CsectionCentral X Was your son breech your whole pregnancy?  What kind of things did you and the docs try and do to help him turn?  Could you feel a difference in labor because he was breech?  And finally... this one may stir up some controversy but I would love to hear yours (and others) thoughts... do you think the lack of teaching and education for OBs and midwives (at least in hospitals, perhaps home births too, IDK) is why they are so "afraid" of breech babies?  I had a friend who was due after me have her child before me because he was breech so the dr. told her she HAD to get a c-section.  They didn't even want to try delivering a breech baby.  While I'm at it, one more, I know you had discussions about c-section before hand so you had some idea it could happen, but was there talk of "skip the vaginal birth all together and go right to c-section" the way my friend ended up having to do?
CsectionCentral X I am not OP but I had a c section because my munchkin was breech. I was given options by my doctor. He set out all the options and was open about the risks of each. He didn't give his opinion and he let my fianc and I have time to discuss it at home. We decided the best option for us was the c section.
AskWomen X Yep! Buy a handful of them; a false negative is always possible with any test, so it's good to have a few spare (either to try again right away, or to test again in a few days time when your body will have produced more of the hormonal indicator which the tests detect.)
BabyBumps X My scan found a Choroid Plexus cyst, too... Whoever it was that called me to tell me the results didn't sound worried, and said she didn't think it was cause for stress, but, needless to say, I freaked out. The blood draw turned out fine a few weeks ago, but I don't really know what to do. :/  Here's to hoping that the little humans we are growing are healthy. It's about the best we can do, right?
TwoXChromosomes X Did the recommended age change? My pediatrician told me to start seeing a gyno when I turned 18, so I've been going for a yearly exam since (I'm 24 now). 
BabyBumps X It was a really in depth sonogram or ultrasound, it was about 40 minutes or so, longer than my typical ultrasound, ad the tech did a ton of measurements and make sure everything was forming as it should... kidneys, bladder, no cleft palate, no clubbed feet ect. She even went as far as to make sure the little hands could open and close, and counted all the fingers and toes :) honestly it was SO much fun! 
BabyBumps X 1 centimeter means nothing. Many women who have given birth or had abortions previously are 1 cm through their entire pregnancies. At 34 weeks, her lungs aren't even developed enough. There is a high probability of NICU time and if active labor started your doctors would give you medications to stop it. I know you can't will yourself to go into preterm labor so it doesn't matter that you're thinking this way but really, you don't want this baby out yet. 
BabyBumps X I was induced last time, but right after they broke my water, I had steady Non-painful contractions that read pretty strong on the monitor. They continued for the next 5 hours. They must have been doing something, because suddenly, THEY WERE PAINFUL. And about an hour later, baby was in my arms.   So maybe call the OB before it's really TIME TO GO. 
TwoXChromosomes X not just the peeing - the pooping. honestly though, my experience was way different between the two. An epidural makes you hold water, and you end up super bloated.   Since I didn't have any drugs with my second, I was up and walkign around. If I felt like I needed to go, I got up and walked to the bathroom. (With help from my husband, and dragging the IV pole with me).   My L&amp;D nurse swore that natural birth is faster, and that an epidural slows it down. But the contractions leading up to the actual pushing are dulled down with the epidural, so its a pro/con relationship that you have to figure out.  With my first my water broke, so I was in the hospital when I was only 2 cm dilated, and it was going to be a loooooong process, and it was already night-time. So I got the epidural under the false belief that I would be able to get sleep. Sigh. On the flip side I got to watch nightline where they were interviewing Rhianna about her abuse incident, while my husband snored on the couch beside me. :-/ 
TwoXChromosomes X It really doesn't have to be horrible.  My first time was fine, though I was scared out of my wits.  I went to a relatively young, female doctor, so I felt more like it was a friend-to-friend interaction, rather than a paternal doctor-patient situation.  That helped put me at ease right off the bat, because I knew that she had gone through the exact same thing before.    Make sure you tell the doctor that it's your first time and that you're scared.  S/he will be very gentle with you and say things like "okay, you're going to feel me touch you now.  okay, this may be a little cold.  now I'm going to feel your ovaries" and so on.  Really walk you through it, so that you're not just lying there, wondering what's coming next.    Now, I don't know if the procedure is different for virgins (I wasn't a virgin the first time I went to the gyno), but here's what always happens for me:  I go in the room and the nurse gives me a paper gown with a big slit up the middle, along with a folded paper drape.  She tells me to take off everything (once she's out of the room), and put on the gown with the slit in front.  Once I do that, I sit on the exam table with the paper drape across my lap, and arrange the gown so that it isn't completely gaping in the front.    When the doctor comes in, she asks if I'm having any problems or concerns.  This is when I ask her about things like birth control, or "I'm having a weird discharge" or whatever.    She has me lie back on the table and she does a breast exam.  That consists of her opening the gown so that one breast is exposed.  She has me raise that arm over my head and she palpates the breast gently, looking for lumps.  When that side is done, she covers me up and does the other side.  This whole time, she's very careful to cover whatever parts aren't being worked on, so that I feel less exposed.  Now, for the actual pelvic exam, this is what happens:  you put your feet in the stirrups, which feels SO awkward.  Your instinct is to bring your knees together, but you'll need to keep them apart.  You will also need to scoot down on the table so that your ass is at the very edge.  The doctor sits on her stool and flips a light on, aimed at your crotch.  She takes her gloved fingers and feels around the vulva, checking for lumps or anything amiss.  I forget which of these comes next, but in some order, the following occur:  she puts a lot of lube on her fingers and puts them inside, with one hand on the outside of the belly and kind of squishes around.  By doing this, she's feeling the uterus and ovaries.  Then she takes the speculum, puts a lot of lube on it, and gently slides it into the vagina.  She opens it, which opens up the vagina.  When she does this part, I always make an effort to exhale, to keep the tension at a minimum (ie, to avoid holding my breath and tensing up).  While the vagina is open, she then takes this little wand-thingy and scrapes a few cells off the cervix.  This doesn't hurt; it just feels sort of weird and scrape-y.  It's literally like 1-2 seconds, if that.  After that, she takes out the speculum and that's that!  We talk about whatever else needs talking about (prescriptions or whatever; I don't have much to say, usually, because I have an IUD now), and I'm done.  She'll leave the room, you'll take some tissues to wipe off the lube, put your clothes on and go.    As long as you can make yourself relax, you'll be fine.  Every doctor I've been to usually tries to make some sort of small talk, to keep you from thinking about what's going on ("so, what kind of work do you do?" and that sort of thing).  It's not the most fun procedure you'll ever have done, but it's mainly just annoying, not horrible.  You'll come through with flying colors!  :)
TwoXChromosomes X Yay!  I love my Mirena!  The procedure itself hurts like a motherfucker for a few minutes, and the vaginal ultrasound is a little weird, but it's a pretty easy procedure, considering what's actually being done.  Make yourself relax, then go home, curl up on the sofa and do something comforting (tea, chocolate, whatever).  You may have weird bleeding for a while and some irregular spotting, so keep some pantyliners close by.  My doctor told me that many women eventually have fewer, lighter or even zero periods after a while.  After about 3 months, my periods got very light, and eventually (after maybe 7 months?) I realized I was barely bleeding at all.  I'm now 3 years in, and I can't even remember the last time I had a period.  I haven't used a tampon in years.  Bliss....
BabyBumps X I haven't asked, but I figured Renee's only about 4lbs at this point.  Like others have said the babies tend to gain weight fast in the last few weeks, so I'm not worried.  I figure she'll be a 6.something pounder like me, maybe a lighter 7ish.
BabyBumps X Op edit! I am in hospital, water is broken, have to wait until one other person gives birth do that they can start pitocin to speed things along (it is not a big hospital).   I will be having a baby at some point in the near future! Yippee!!! It doesn't seem real.... Even with a monitor on the baby 's scalp ..... 
Parenting X An epidural will often slow labour and may ultimately end in a c section. From a woman who has had two babies completely med free, I can tell you first hand, it isn't that bad, and when it's over it's over.  Take the gas or Demerol, but if you can go without an epidural, I say do it. 
BabyBumps X It's fine if choosing an unnecessary and unnatural major medical procedure is what you want for yourself but being angry and judgmental that other women chose to labor as their bodies were designed to and in the way that best allows for the natural release of essential brain chemicals is just weird. I don't agree with your choice and I side eye doctors who allow women to have major surgery for no reason but I give precisely zero fucks about how your children enter the world and I don't know why youd care about women who choose natural birth.
BabyBumps X We see this question on here a lot... hell, I even posted it on here back when I was first pregnant! The cramping is scary but it's perfectly normal. My co-workers scared me into thinking I was definitely going to m/c but thankfully I didn't. If they're mild/annoying and you're not bleeding, you're most likely just fine. Call your doctor if you're concerned but understand that *many* women go through this at the beginning. My cramping stopped around 12 weeks or so and just recently started back up, except now mine are because of contractions, lololol. The cramping is, as my OB told me, your uterus adjusting to all the new things happening to it. It's just settling in and it's best to just try and relax :) you're going to be fine!
Parenting X I had an EPI with all four kids and between first two I have experienced natural labor and birth. With my first contraction weren't to bad and were low in my belly , With my second I went from a 4cm to 8cm in 30 min and i had bad back contraction that cause pain in my legs and stomach and back. I got to the hospital at 9cm and I got the epi.  I loved having the epi and it was relaxing,
BabyBumps X Exactly this. I started dilating and effacing around 35 weeks, I've been nearly 4 centimeters and 60% for almost 2 weeks and I'm being induced tomorrow .
BabyBumps X I felt the same as you up until about 20 or so weeks, I was all for asking for an ELCS as I was petrified. But then something just changed, I thought to myself "I can do this!" And was actually reaaally bit wanting a C Section. Don't get me wrong I was still like "give me ALL the pain relief" and wasn't against intervention, but I was still ready to tackle this childbirth thing.  Turns out baby stayed breech and I was booked in for an ELCS anyway, but I had the time to prepare myself for that.  I agree that when there is significant risk to mother or baby people should be open to intervention, but otherwise people are entitled to their opinions and to birth how they wish. Same applies to you, so just don't let people make you feel guilty for your choice, it is your right. ELCS are a lot safer than emergency ones although they still hold a lot of risk being major surgery (you can't go through with anything thinking about the good without knowing about the bad). 
BabyBumps X I hope your like my mom, she went in for an induction when she was a week over due to find out she was in early labor!!!!! They let her body do it's thing bc it had finally started and it all worked out for the best 
TwoXChromosomes X Two weeks fetal age is 4 weeks gestation age, since they count from LMP (Last Missed Period). So when someone says they are, say 24 weeks, the fetal age is actually 22 weeks. 2 weeks fetal age is pretty much the earliest you can find out.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;No the woman's right to choose to murder wouldn't be taken away. The victims choice to live is what is taken away in a murder.  Tada!
BabyBumps X I understand! Not past my EDD yet but am due on Tuesday. Everyone seems to think I will go past that. I'm hoping she decides she's ready to come soon. I'm feeling so uncomfortable :( Come on little girl!! We are ready! 
TwoXChromosomes X When life begins is really what the argument boils down to. What I mean is science says first trimester its an embryo, second trimester it becomes a fetus. Sure the times are going to be a bit different between women, but its a good enough measure. Like I said above, I've never met a person in favor of late term abortions as birth control, but you'll find a lot of pro-lifers that believe life begins when the sperm hits the egg, which is frankly ludicrous. If that were true we should stop trying to cure cancer or remove tumors because cells are "alive"  Laws say we shouldn't murder people. Abortion isn't murder. So it is legal. I don't really know how to break it down more than that. If you need more explanation on why it became law you might want to go read the supreme court's ruling on Roe v Wade.  &gt;I would also like to hear why we can take away a murderer's choice to murder but cannot take away a woman's choice to have an abortion.  The murderer is taking away the victims right to be alive, which I hope you'll agree is more important than a murderers right to murder.    
TwoXChromosomes X I think that is the only possition to do what they need to.  Maybe talking to the doctor first to explain the procedure and having her tell you what she is doing at each step would help.  But if you've always had clean paps, I think the standard is every ywo years, not every year now.  Ask your doctor about that also.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;So, if you have a miscarriage, you can be convicted of murder.  No.  This is factually not the case.  Murder is a legal term.  It requires malice aforethought.  In any event, women are already legally obligated to their fetus in many states.  There is just a legal exception for abortions.  You can be convicted if you, say, abuse crack cocaine during your pregnancy.  If someone batters you during your pregnancy and it forces a miscarriage they could be tried for fetal homicide.  
BabyBumps X I was about 30 weeks when I decided to go natural with my son. Best decision I ever made.I had an epidural with my daughter and I ended up needing a blood transfusion and she had some breathing issues. My son was born with no complications and I felt a million times better. Yes it was more painful and I was very anxious to be done especially during transition but it was worth it afterwards.
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not the person you asked, but here's my take:  Science has not conclusively defined when life/sentience begins, so it remains ambiguous and therefore open to interpretation based on one's belief system. Some believe life begins at fertilization; some believe it begins at implantation; some believe it begins at viability; some believe it begins at birth. And no one can definitively disprove the other belief system, since the evidence just is not there (and there is disagreement on definition, as well).   However, we can clearly see that women -- including pregnant women -- are certainly alive and therefore imbued with rights to life, choice, privacy, etc. Since we do not know when a zygote/embryo/fetus is sentient/alive but we do know that women are sentient and alive, we must acknowledge and recognize women's right to control their bodies. We cannot take away rights in ambiguous situations like this; we must err on the side of preserving the rights that are unassailable.  &gt; I would also like to hear why we can take away a murderer's choice to murder but cannot take away a woman's choice to have an abortion.  You know the saying, "My liberty ends where yours begins"? That is the answer to your question, and it is a reiteration of what I said above. Murderers are infringing on their victims' liberty, on their rights to choose what happens to them. Women who choose abortion are exercising liberty by choosing what happens to their bodies, because there is not a clear line of distinction between the fetus as a person with liberty and the pregnant woman. 
BabyBumps X I felt like that. I felt mildly crampy (like I was about to get my period) for about 2 weeks after finding out I was pregnant. Totally normal. 
BabyBumps X I felt pregnant immediately and still was in denial until 7 weeks. I'm at 12 weeks now. My belly always feels stretchy and It's such a hassle to roll over or get up because my torso is so stiff even with the tons of extra exercise I do.  Also my fat migrated from my legs to my belly so I have a big round pregnant-ish belly aside from the fact that it's just a little squishier than normal. 
BabyBumps X I didn't get an epidural and I made it! I would look into a walking epidural though, or using a different pain management like gas. I don't know a lot about it but I know it can be awesome! Also morphine. To be honest with you (only my opinion!), not using an epidural or any pain management was awesome for me. It was... humbling I guess. Look into other options though! You can do this!!!! :)
TwoXChromosomes X What do you mean "just had" your period?  What day of your cycle are you on?  If your cycle are always 24 days or longer and your period started 1-4 days ago then yes, you are theoretically at the safest time.  If your cycles are ever shorter than 24 days or it is after day 5 of your period then NO, you are not at a safe part of your cycle.  Either way you should try to get plan B.
TwoXChromosomes X Seriously talk to him about it, but NOT during sex.  Pick some neutral time when you're both in a decent mood.  Maybe take a shower together (that's a good time for me to talk to my husband, I've found).    Figure out what it is you want out of sexytimes, what he wants, and how you get there together.  Do you want to orgasm?  Is it that HE wants you to orgasm?  We (husband and I) have something of a similar situation, in that he tends to finish before me during sex, so we tend to have sexytime round one with him doing things to me (and me to him), and sexytime round two with intercourse!  Yay!  The hubs definitely wants me to orgasm, but I don't have to/want to all the time - so sometimes I'm like, saddle up, playtime's over!    And toys.  And showerheads.  And food.  And wine.  You know... weee :)  Good luck, hope you can have a useful conversation!  edit: clarity
BabyBumps X I had a 'small corpus luteal cyst,' which caused what they called 'implantation bleeding,' (light browny pink discharge, was red once).  The pain felt very localized in my left ovary, and went away in a relatively short period of time.    Obviously, I'm not a doctor, but this is what happened to me, and my little guy is doing quite well :)
BabyBumps X Thanks :) I'm so excited for my little dragon baby! He's currently kicking my rib and it feels very uncomfortable, but now that I feel better, pregnancy is wonderful!
BabyBumps X That's awesome! Congratulations and welcome!   So many new people here in r/babybumps and I'm at the end of my pregnancy! :(   Oh well, I'll probably stay around afterwards lol. 
beyondthebump X I had both.  The narcotics were kind of nice.  While they didn't make the contractions hurt any less, they did make me too loopy to really complain or care.  The epidural was awesome, though!  I was completely numb from the waist down, but for some reason the pain from the back labor cut right through the epidural.  I can't imagine what that would have felt like without the epidural!  
Parenting X No, and when she does go in the doctor always tells her that my niece is underweight. I do wonder if sometimes when she says she goes if she actually does go. I would hope a doctor would notice things like this but since they really only go on what the parents say...Idk.  We go to the same doctor, so I know our doctor asks questions and checks out how they walk. 
BabyBumps X Awesome! Yeah I went to an outside ultrasound place 'cause my next dr appointment isn't until Sept 10th and it isn't for an ultrasound, just a check up! I was way impatient, lol
TwoXChromosomes X It's Mishna, so there is a debate on if it is Biblical or Rabbinical. Either way, Jewish law puts the life of the fetus below that of the mother, until the fetus' head has come out - then they are seen as two separate lives, each deserving of the same treatment.   &gt; If a woman is in hard travail, one cuts up the offspring in her womb and brings it forth member by member, because her life comes before the life of her foetus. But if the greater part has proceeded forth, one may not set aside one person for the sake of saving another.  mOholot 7:8, trans. Sinclair p.12
TwoXChromosomes X I think we didn't communicate well. I know looking for the right option that won't have too bad side effects is hard. I've gone through a few types and brands. But if you are absolutely sure you don't want kids, why not go the permanent route or even your husband. It's the best option for the mind and the wallet. 
AskWomen X Well, I dealt with the cramp thing for YEARS until I finally went to a gynecologist when I was 16. I would just suggest talking to your mom and doctor to see if it's the right thing for you.
beyondthebump X I had intense pelvic floor pain, so my case is kind of different, but I did opt to try nubain first before the epidural, so I could stay at the birth center. It made me so loopy, the opposite of what I wanted to be. I wanted to be present and aware. I finally got an epidural, which wasn't completely effective at numbing me, but allowed my pelvic floor to unclench, and I wish I'd only done that. I think  the trick to those is waiting as long as you can to get them so they don't have to administer as much pit. And as I said, I could still feel pain, but it was manageable.  Between my extreme fatigue and the nubain, I was pretty out of it for the actual birth. If I had the epidural only, I could have slept and woke up rested and alert. Luckily, having Ever snapped me out of it for the most part, and I could enjoy those moments.
TwoXChromosomes X That's the thing, very late term abortions are only done under extreme circumstances, like the fetus isn't viable or the mother is very sick.  There is only one doctor in the entire US that will even perform abortions at that stage, and the other one who did them was murdered by an anti-choicer.  It's a straw-man argument that anti-choicers like to throw out.  
AskWomen X When I finally went on BC as a teenager, my period went from 9-10 days long (5 of very heavy bleeding, 2-3 of intensely painful cramps) to maybe 5 days long (with 2-3 days of moderate bleeding and little to no pain).  It hurt less, in part, because there was so much less of it.  For me, it *helped* with mood/depression issues, probably because it flattened out my hormone fluctuations.  Birth control does tend to increase your cup size, which I guess can be good or bad depending on how you currently feel about your boobs, and many people gain a little bit of weight too.
BabyBumps X I got all those symptoms by 3.5 weeks -- except nausea, that started later. I think I'm like the queen of early pregnancy symptoms. Sounds totally normal to me! Congrats! 
beyondthebump X I had both, fentanyl in earlier labor and an epidural when shit got real. The fentanyl was great, but it also made me really sick. The epidural, in contrast, was a gift from the gods. I wanted to name our baby after the anesthetist.
TwoXChromosomes X There's a very good chance you had a minor painless tear that bled. It has happened to me a few times. I suggest using a lot of lube to keep things from drying out and irritating the skin. See a gyno just in case.
TwoXChromosomes X Just take some ibuprofen before and you'll be fine. It's just slightly more uncomfortable than a smear. Little bits of pain but you can survive it no problem!
TwoXChromosomes X Two time Implanon user here. I would def see if you could get some pills with similar hormones before you choose to get the implant itself. With my first implant I had three years of complete normality and almost no periods at all. It was great. When I changed it and got the second one everything went wrong, and I had the same experiences you've had; low to no sex drive and terrible mood swings. Strain on the relationships? Yes.   So I'm actually in the same situation you are in (except I want to have kids some day). I caved and went back to the pill because I couldn't find a good enough alternative. Yasminelle is pretty okay, though. Not great, but not bad. 
AskWomen X BC has way more benefits than not making babies. I would recommend a low hormone(makes your hormones less crazy), but your Gyno will tell you what's best for you. Birth control helps your complexion(which you may not have to worry about for a couple of years), helps you regulate your period do you can map it down to the exact day it will start. It helps with flow not being too heavy(which mine always was). Good luck and I am so sorry it's happening to you. I hope all is well.
TwoXChromosomes X Congrats! I taught both of my daughters how to use tampons when they first started their periods. I have always used them and I hate pads. It feels like you are wearing a diaper. Tampons are the way to go! ;-) 
TwoXChromosomes X Did you try spinning the Diva Cup to get it to seal?  Also I put mine higher than they say too and never feel it.  Maybe if you put it higher.  Or, there's another cup... moon cup maybe?  It's not as long.    One thing that might help you with either cups or non-applicator tampons is just putting your finger in your vagina and feeling.  (Wash your hands first, of course.)  Get a sense for the angle of your vagina, where it's tighter and where it opens up.  Do some kegels and feel what parts get tightest.  Feel your cervix, find out how far it is down into your vagina.  Roll your finger so your finger tips feel the top and bottom vaginal walls.  It helps, for me at least, knowing my specific anatomy when I'm putting things up or taking them out.  I know when I've passed the tight spot so I can let the Diva Cup open up, I know how far I need to go to use an applicator free tampon or cup, I know what muscles to use if they go a little high and I'm struggling to reach, I know which muscles to relax if I'm tense and struggling to get it in.
TwoXChromosomes X I was also a late bloomer with tampons.  As for how best to work them...I've found you may need to experiment for the tampon that's most comfortable. I cannot wear anything except for two specific brands, in fact, because they are SO uncomfortable coming out.  And it may seem gross, but try applicator-less tampons. I first tried them because my friend had nothing else. I swear by them now.
TwoXChromosomes X I remember how good it felt to not bleed about three months after getting my paragard! Although I still spot for about a week after my period finishes :/ it's worth the peace of mind though.
BabyBumps X It was easy for me to switch. I called my original provider and asked what that would mean on their end in terms of billing and records. I found a nearby certified nurse midwife practice located within a local outpatient center affiliated with a hospital. I looked up reviews and interviewed them. We were so happy with the interview I didn't look at any other places, this one fits my philosophy much better. It took the first place a few weeks to get my records over but the new practice got me in right away for my next scheduled appointment and the anatomy scan. It all depends on what is available in your area, YMMV. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X If she has back pain and chills, the UTI could have transformed into a kidney infection. Tell her to drink nothing but water or cranberry juice until she's feeling better.    And if her doctor says it might be something else, then she needs to stay in contact with her doctor to find out what it is. 
TwoXChromosomes X Hey! UTI veteran here.  I have ZERO concern that you have an STD, but getting tested never hurts. I'm FAIRLY sure her UTI has actually become a kidney infection, judging by the back pain and chills. If this is the case, she desperately needs to get to a doctor for some antibiotics. Kidney infections are generally pretty easy to deal with, provided she gets to a doctor and gets it taken care of.  Cranberry juice in the mean time can help with symptoms like pain, but IS NOT A CURE. Only antibiotics will fix this. I will add that in the future, consumption of cranberry juice can help prevent UTIs, but again, is not a cure for present infections.
BabyBumps X I have two friends in pharmacy school, and they have both told me to double check meds my doctor prescribes. Yes, they know a lot about what they are talking about. But they may not necessarily know medications and their side effects. What I like about my doctor, she will look up a medication in front of me before she sends me off to take it. 
TwoXChromosomes X I only know about this because at my last pap smear, my gyno showed me the goo on her fingers and how it stretches when she pinches her fingers together and then pulls them apart.    Awkward. 
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not sure how Trileptal interacts with birth control but maybe ask your doctor if something besides the combined pill would be safe (as this is true of some drug interactions), like the minipill (no estrogen) or the Nuvaring (not used orally).
BabyBumps X *hugs* I'm right there with you! 4 days past my due date. It's funny to see people's faces when I use past tense with them when they ask when I'm due. My mom went into labor with all of us at the exact same thing, 42 weeks + 3 days, so I'm not expecting to go into labor anytime soon. It seems all us August mamas are going late. I hope we both good into labor today!!
TwoXChromosomes X My mom got pregnant with me while on the pill because her doctor didn't tell her the antibiotics he was giving her would nullify the effects of her BC.   Isn;t Lo Loestrin one if the really really time sensitive ones? As in, if you don't take it at *the exact same time* every day it isn't effective?
AskWomen X Just a suggestion if you are on or are considering birth control. Depo shot = no periods for a lot of women. It has been amazing.   Pre-depo I would do the tampon/pad combo. 
TwoXChromosomes X Cramping, for me, is a general ache/pain in the uterine and lower back area. Whole damn region aches for days on end. Midcycle is a sharp, searing pain, when I get it, and drugs don't help. I just kind of want to die for that couple of days. Doesn't even correlate with cysts. I know, 'cause I got an ultrasound once during an awful bout. So weird.
TwoXChromosomes X Well I've been getting UTIs since I was about 2. Once when I was 11 it became a kidney infection and I had the same symptoms. She should just get checked out by a doctor and get some antibiotics. Then she should be fine within a few weeks (maybe a little longer)
TwoXChromosomes X It actually is pretty effective from [planned parenthood]( -topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm):  * Of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal, 4 will become pregnant each year if they always do it correctly. * Of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal, 27 will become pregnant each year if they don't always do it correctly.  Compare that to condoms also from [planned parenthood]( -topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm):  * Each year, 2 out of 100 women whose partners use condoms will become pregnant if they always use condoms correctly. * Each year, 18 out of 100 women whose partners use condoms will become pregnant if they don't always use condoms correctly.  Seems more than a reasonable method to me.  Especially if it is not economically or physically viable to use condoms or the pill, etc.  Edit: added "etc" to the condoms or the pill, since there are so many birth control options out there.
TwoXChromosomes X I'd go to your doctor. Also, you can't know the side effects of the pill for at least two months, after your body adjusts... 
TwoXChromosomes X I was on Nuvaring for about a year. It made me absolutely crazy, I gained about ten pounds and my sex drive shot down.  I haven't been on any BC for about three years, I want to go on something but I'm afraid of having side effects again and I cannot remember to take a pill. 
TwoXChromosomes X I recommend getting something else (I'm swapping from the pill to a hormonal IUD) that decreases the potential for human error (implant, IUD, Nuvaring), since those methods don't rely on you remembering to take them.
BabyBumps X That's kind of how I've been lol.. At the beginning of my pregnancy it was obsessively running and checking for blood... now it's amniotic fluid. The circle of pregnancy, eh?  Yay for mucus though!(maybe?)
TwoXChromosomes X the usual advice (in the pack) is that missing one pill from a whole strip is not usually a concern, and that protection starts from pill 1 if taken within 5 days of a real period
BabyBumps X I'm right there with you :( My vagina feels like it's going to fall out. Putting on my pants, turning side to side in bed--it's terrible. My doctor told me to just take it easy, but it's all normal. 
TwoXChromosomes X I have never even considered the possibility that I could be in a relationship and not be able to financially support myself 100%. I think it's very smart planning. There are a lot of "what ifs" out there and it's better to be prepared, wherever possible.
AskWomen X To me, girth is more important than length. But, generally, if it's adequate girth, 8+ inches is too big, and under 5 is too small. But, that's just my personal view. I like sex to hurt just a little bit, too, so there's that.
TwoXChromosomes X I suggest no Monistat only because I have used it during a yeast infection and it was the single most painful experience of my life. The itching tripled, and it burned like hell. Diflucan is the only effective way to treat a yeast infection (I've found) and its quick and easy. Call the office and ask for them to call in a prescription to the pharmacy. Also, might I suggest switching doctors? If a doctor spoke to me like that, like with no terms and information I definitely wouldn't feel comfortable. In his defense, doctors usually don't warn about yeast infections after antibiotics because they don't always happen. Everyone is different. ONE MORE THING SORRY FOR THE RANT: If there is no pain or itching, you may not have one. Secretions aren't a major sign of one, physical pain and itching are. You can definitely try the cultured yogurt thing at home, also stop eating anything with yeast or sugar in it for a few days, but if you feel itching or soreness at all, call up the office. 
AskWomen X Not only is it rare, [it's healthier and safer:]( -pubic-hair-exists-reason-our-obsession-hairless-genitals-must-end-0)  &gt;Pubic hair removal naturally irritates and inflames the hair follicles left behind, leaving microscopic open wounds.  Rather than suffering a comparison to a bristle brush, frequent hair removal is necessary to stay smooth, causing regular irritation of the shaved or waxed area.  When that irritation is combined with the warm moist environment of the genitals, it becomes a happy culture media for some of the nastiest of bacterial pathogens, namely group A streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus and its recently mutated cousin methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA).   There is an increase in staph boils and abscesses, necessitating incisions to drain the infection, resulting in scarring that can be significant.   It is not at all unusual to find pustules and other hair follicle inflammation papules on shaved genitals.  &gt;Additionally, Ive seen cellulitis (soft tissue bacterial infection without abscess) of the scrotum, labia and penis from spread of bacteria from shaving or from sexual contact with strep or staph bacteria from a partners skin.  &gt;Some clinicians are finding that freshly shaved pubic areas and genitals are also more vulnerable to herpes infections due to the microscopic wounds being exposed to virus carried by mouth or genitals.   It follows that there may be vulnerability to spread of other STIs as well.
TwoXChromosomes X Well, that's what I was going to do. I took the last pill in the pack on Monday, and started my placeboes on Tuesday... so I was going to start my new pack tomorrow. That's what you meant, right?   If I do it that way, will I be protected then? 
BabyBumps X I tested. I am considered high risk because of advanced maternal age (35). I live in Canada where the test was free. And even though it has I high incidence of false positives, I wanted to be able to prepare should something be wrong. I would not have aborted for downs syndrome, but would have researched, mourned the idea of a 'perfect' baby, and prepared my family.  I realize that anything could still happen. It's a very personal choice. Good luck whatever you decide to do!  ;). 
BabyBumps X I haven't given birth yet so I'm not sure which will end up being more beneficial, but I'm really loving our in person Bradley classes.  We actually didn't buy the Bradley books but are taking those classes and then reading up on other methods.  Around here though, 27 weeks is too late to get in on Bradley class.  If I were you I'd research what's available in your area, talk to some of the instructors, and then decide what you think would work best for you.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; If your definition of an individual with full human rights is someone who is biologically independent, then do we have the right to go around pulling plugs on people who need machines to live?   Dependence on a machine does not make you biologically dependent on any single person.  Btw "full human rights" doesn't include full access to a woman's uterus for sustenance or development.  &gt; Hi, I'm AlexandertheCool, someone you haven't met, and in this discussion I haven't used any religious axioms except "Right of a fetus to live," which isn't really religious but philosophical and which is certainly on par with your notion of human reproductive rights at the very least.  You might want to re-read what you quoted.  I never suggested that you used a religious axiom.  I specifically stated that I personally have yet to hear a logically consistent argument for why [human] life itself should be of ultimate importance above all else  &gt; I'd be happy to have this argument with you and can even leave religion out of it. Seeing as I'm not the one who brought it up, I think that's a credible claim.  You can attempt to debate your position, but I suggest you take some time to properly articulate it.  I've seen anti-choice arguments from so many different angles, yet I have still not seen a single logically consistent or coherent argument for why anyone should control a woman for 9 months and force her to take on the risks to her body and life.  Biologically, philosophically, pragmatically, and morally it never makes sense to ban abortion.  
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;If your definition of an individual with full human rights is someone who is biologically independent, then do we have the right to go around pulling plugs on people who need machines to live?  People on life support are mechanically dependent, but are still biologically independent.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; So your definition of life is biological independence from a single person, correct?  No.  &gt; Well, I'd be happy to try. I've been debating life issues for some time as well, and I have yet to see anyone who can create a logically consistent argument that would place the reproductive rights of women above the human rights of unborn children.  Well the term "unborn child" is an oxymoron, which is generally intentionally used to invoke the natural human empathetic emotional response of an image of an infant.  I don't need to resort to such tactics when defending the right to choose.  &gt; Biologically, philosophically, pragmatically, and morally it makes sense to ban abortion.  So far this doesn't seem like an honest attempt to debate at all.  &gt; I'd like to start with your definition of life, which I asked about above, if that's okay  It's not exactly black and white but biologically speaking we can generally just define life on earth as organisms. 
BabyBumps X Question: With your second child your first appointment was at 15 weeks. I was having trouble with insurance but it will be figured out by the end of this week. So my first appointment will likely be 14-15 weeks. I'm nervous that they'll be upset with me for waiting so long. Everything seems completely "normal." Did you have any issues with going in so late?
TwoXChromosomes X Since you can have a UTI with no symptoms other than cloudy, smelly pee and a fever, it's not really that weird that it doesn't hurt sometimes.  Also, I'd recommend cranberry concentrate pills instead, because you have to drink an absolutely ridiculous amount of cranberry juice for it to be effective.
BabyBumps X Yes!  It does SUCK!  Way more than I thought it would. Mine seems worse hen I first wake up and gets slightly better throughout the day. Although I haven't not had tingling in the fingers on my right hand in weeks.  Plus it's really hard to write out thank you cards. :(. And I can't open jars that my SO tightens. Boo....   My doctor said more often than not it will disappear shortly after delivery. As will my water retention, pain in my hips, pain in my pelvis, etc....  Here's hoping the pain and discomfort related to delivery are not terribly worse. :/
TwoXChromosomes X Well I've always had long/ ireegular/ far too frequent periods so it wasn't so bad. And there was a day or two every week or so that I didnt have any spotting or that. Plus it didn't hurt because there was no cramping or bloating. But I've heard of other people who've had it who had much less bleeding so I think the 13 weeks is more to do with me than the implanon.
TwoXChromosomes X I basically do the same thing minus a huge pop.  I fold it and stick it in and twist to unfold although sometimes if it doesn't seem in far enough I will feel around for the position of my cervix and the cup.  If you aren't having issues it doesn't really matter how you insert it.
BabyBumps X You'll do great!! Some babies are just small :) My friend got induced at 39 weeks because her baby was just barely 4 pounds according to the doctors, he ended up being born a bit over 6 pounds. 33 weeks seems pretty early to be sending labor vibes though! Your baby has got to stay in there to keep cooking :)
TwoXChromosomes X Definitely check out this [chart]( -cups.livejournal.com/1285963.html). I personally found Diva Cup to be too long (it is the longest cup made) and wish I'd picked something a bit shorter.
TwoXChromosomes X It seriously changed my life. It's not for everyone, but it was well worth trying out for me.   As for advantages, I posted this before on [this thread]( _i_have_discovered_something_glorious_what/c19jero) that has some humorous highlights.  There are lot of positives for me.  * You can keep it in for 12 hours, which eliminates changing your stuff all the time (tampons only last a few hours usually). I mess with it once a day until I get home, and it's nice not have to think about it through the day. I don't have to worry about making sure I have supplies at work or school or while out.  * I can go to the bathroom without slippage. And no more pulling out dry tampons (seriously the worst). * It good for up to 10 years. * On that end, it's much cheaper overall. You can find it from iherb.com and google a $5 off new customer coupon and get one for $20. I can spend $20 on tampons in just a few months. It has a guarantee so it's also risk-free. * Since it acts as a barrier, I can have hand, oral and anal sex all year round with worrying about leaks, a tampon string or getting blood everywhere. It makes sex during your period so much less messier. * It is so much more comfortable. I usually forget I even have it in and have to check sometimes. I can always feel a tampon. Shoving a dry wad of cotton up your vagina is not always comfortable.  * My periods are shorter and lighter, and my cramps are significantly lessened. There are no studies that support these finds as of yet, but many users report the same thing. It's not soaking in any of the fluids that belongs there so some attribute it to that. * I have become more comfortable with my body and periods.  * It's amazing for traveling, especially to countries where tampons and pads are harder to come by. You don't have to worry about packing enough supplies or finding and buying them. * I never have to run out to get a box of tampons or pads. I am always prepared. * On that note, it's super compact so it does not take up a bunch of space in my bathroom or my purse or wherever. If I am going out, this is a plus since it's once less thing to carry. * Better for the environment  Surely I missed something, but I think this covers it. Anytime I suggest it someone and they get one, they send me an email raving about it for the same reasons. It was one of those things that is so amazing, I am surprised more people don't rave about it. I cannot recommend one enough.  More good threads:  [I have a friend who swears by the Diva Cup. I'm skeptical as it seems um risky at best. Could you please share your experiences using it or something similar? The good, bad, &amp; the ugly are all appreciated. Thanks in advance. : \)]( _have_a_friend_who_swears_by_the_diva_cup_im/)  [The Multiple Benefits of Menstrual Cups] ( _multiple_benefits_of_menstrual_cups/)  [Should I invest in a diva cup?]( _i_invest_in_a_divacup/)
TwoXChromosomes X Been there, done that. She'll probably need to do a colposcopy. If that comes back positive for pre-cancerous cells, then you'll move on to a LEEP.   Had a LEEP procedure and I've tested clean consistently the last five years. You'll be fine, but make sure you get it taken care of quickly. 
BabyBumps X I plan to work as long as I can.  Fortunately, I signed up for short-term disability last year.  With the plan I got, I will be able to take up to 26 weeks (I would like to take all of it after, but may end up taking the last week or two off) and get 70% of my pay every week.    
TwoXChromosomes X Ok, that still doesn't make him a jerk. I am very much pro-life. The two reasons I'm for fully legalizing abortions are: 1) There is no reliable support system for single mothers/mothers to be who need it.  2) I don't want women to be bleeding out in back alleys thanks to coat hangers.   And yet I still agree with Huckabee on this. Don't abort pregnancies due to rape just because they're pregnancies due to rape. Do it because carrying the child to term would cause long-term psychological damage. (Also if carrying the child to term would cause long-term physical damage. Or short-term death.) 
TwoXChromosomes X I've been using a Diva Cup for eight months now (I'm 25 and haven't had kids). I can't speak to the other brands available, but this one has worked very well for me. Many ladies here have already spoken well about what they like about their cups (pretty much all of which I agree with), so I figured I would share some things that pertained very strongly to me.  My period is heavy. Holy fuck, hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife, because this geyser is dangerous. Anyway, my approach used to be wearing both overnight pads and the heaviest-duty tampons in reach (typically the Super Plus OB tampons). For the first three days of my period, I was changing tampons every three hours, and even that wasn't always enough to keep from overflowing once or twice a day. As you might imagine, I spent a LOT of money on menstrual products. I now have my Diva Cup and a few reusable pads. On my heaviest days, I empty my cup every six hours, with only one case ever of a spillover in that time frame. I've had a few other accidents, but those were all cases of just forgetting that I needed to go empty it because *I forgot that I was having my period*. It's really comfortable for me.  Another thing that has been great for me is wearing it while working out. I work out fucking hard. I like biking and I've done some of the major commercial programs like Insanity and P90X. While biking on my period, I bled like a maniac, presumably from the way I was bearing down with all my muscles, which typically resulted in an overflow because no tampon could fight that. There were also two hilarious times while doing Insanity that I performed one of the jump moves while very tired and really straining, and my tampon just (*bloop*) popped out. No such problems with my cup. It stays right there no matter what.  The way I see it, if you can afford to risk $20-$30 that could ultimately end up saving you tons of money in the future, do it. If you don't like it, turn it into a very tiny and odd-looking plant pot. You could probably grow a single green bean out of it.
TwoXChromosomes X There is a world of difference. A sperm or an egg can not be a person. It has zero viability and does not have unique DNA (it's just a subset of the parent) so its just an extension of the original person. An zygote is very different has its own truly unique genetic code and has the potential to be a living breathing thinking fully formed person. This is why abortion and BC are radically different (especially once you move past the first trimester). This doesn't mean anything about the ethical implications of either, but it does mean you shouldn't compare the two if you want people to believe you understand the issue on even the most basic level. 
BabyBumps X You could have a benign thyroid nodule or other relatively innocuous condition, too. Either way, it's good to get some bloodwork done just to make sure all your levels are good as a funky thyroid can mean horrible things for baby, AND can often be easily remedied with hormone supplements. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; The biology of humans is barely more interesting than that of sea urchins and it shouldn't much enter into the choice/life debate. This is a moral and philosophical issue, not a biological one.  I agree to a point.  Biology impacts philosophy in the sense that a zygote doesn't possess the ability to think nor has it ever had it's own philosophical identity at that point in time.  There's also the issue of biological ability to feel pain with a low chance of survival playing into decisions on whether to end the suffering.  Also at some theoretical point in the future if we ever are able to develop a fetus entirely out of womb, then there's going to be another debate of whether parents or anyone else can stop the process.
TwoXChromosomes X I know they're not. I'm just saying, that I support the right to have an abortion in cases of rape (or incest). I know that that unfortunately would involve a whole slew of red tape and gray areas, and inconclusive evidence. The only thing I don't support is abortions, for lack of a better term, "on demand"
BabyBumps X I don't recommend it, especially if you are a worrier. It will just cause unnecessary stress for you and your baby. It usually isn't necessary to monitor the heart rate outside of your normal prenatal appointments.
AskWomen X for what it's worth, I used to routinely experience such horrifying pain (period cramps) that I would faint and/or throw up.   subsided once I went on birth control, but... yeah. that feeling of "holy fuck my pelvis is trying to kill m---VOM" is altogether unpleasant. 
BabyBumps X - I was nauseous, and only nauseous, for my entire first trimester. Week 5-12ish I was just nauseous all day every day. Never threw up once :) That being said, you're right! Everyone is different!  - My boobs went from hurting all over, to aching in specific spots, to now just my nipples hurting. I have no idea what lies in store for me over the next ~16 weeks! So... yes and no!
BabyBumps X Confirmed it was a girl at my repeat anatomy scan at 24 weeks. Usually you find out at your anatomy scan at around 20 weeks. Even if they guess a gender at 12 weeks, I wouldn't put my heart into it. I was told boy at 12 weeks, and my little baby is definitely a little lady! 
Parenting X If Americans had 1 year maternity leave, I think SO many more women would breastfeed. I think the only reason I made it this long is because I didn't work during her first 11.5 months. My co-worker I talked about earlier came back after 6 weeks, and that is the norm for workers in the US. It's not paid though, so I know women who have to go back at 2 weeks. If you have worked at a place over a year and they have over 100 workers (I think that's the number) you can take 12 weeks unpaid off.
TwoXChromosomes X I've been on Alesse for... just about 2 years now, and I usually get my period on the Saturday after I start my placebos (I start taking placebos on Wednesday, so it'd be 4 days into my placebos that it starts) and after a few months of taking it, it levelled out so that my period only lasted at max 5 days, but usually less. And now, my period only lasts 4! It just takes a while to figure out a game plan. Don't worry - as long as you've been taking them properly, I'm sure you're not pregnant or anything.
BabyBumps X I just started to feel little kicks harder than a flutter this past week. It's still so strange.. I still question if the feeling is real or if I imagined it. :) I really can't wait though until my SO can feel them. 
TwoXChromosomes X It's incorrect information.  &gt;Perfect use oral contraceptives have a much lower fail rate than that. Progesterone only is [0.5%]( -only_pill#Efficacy_and_effectiveness), combined oestrogen and progesterone is even better at [0.3%]( _oral_contraceptive_pill).
TwoXChromosomes X And, depending on cycle, some women can *never have sex* under the rhythm method as they are fertile again the day they stop their period.
BabyBumps X If its bright blood, its coming from a more external source. Its the dark, sticky blood that is worrisome. Dark blood comes from higher inside the colon. Its most likely a hemorrhoid or anal fissure. Still, if it worries you, talk to your doctor or midwife about it.
beyondthebump X C-section here too. It does hurt. I was convinced somehow I had become a virgin again :) with practice and patience it slowly gets better. And lube, lots of lube.
TwoXChromosomes X Some people would rather die than be pregnant (or at least take the risk of death.)  That is why illegal abortions were so prevalent prior to Roe v. Wade.
TwoXChromosomes X excellent breakdown.  &gt;would you say that a woman's right to an abortion is the right to kill the foetus, or the right to remove it from her body, and if it dies, it dies?  this is an interesting question that hasn't been posed to me before.  i think the hidden assumption in this question is that the fetus is even "alive".  if we can somehow define when a fetus becomes alive, then this question will be easier to answer.  because you can only kill something that lives...right?  another interesting question that i've thought about:  the distinction between human *life* and human *consciousness*.  if someone argued that a fetus was alive at conception, okay, whatever, but at what point does a human being become *conscious*?  which is inviting an even more interesting question-  what is consciousness?  yikes, it is probably too early for these types of questions.
TwoXChromosomes X They embryo doesn't have biological functions on its own though.   Same species parasite. 
TwoXChromosomes X Can the government force a doctor to save a dying patients life, or at least punish those that don't? Once you put yourself in a position that an organism requires you for survival, you get a lot less leeway. That is why rape exclusions are so common. Your analogy doesn't establish why the father is connect to the child. A pregnancy doesn't involve to independent organisms as your analogy. They are not valid comparisons.   There is a difference between forcing one to sustain life, and allowing for one to take such sustenance away. I can kill anyone if I am justified in removing their necessary nutrients. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;It's the abortion that ends it's life, the donor was already selected in the original mother  Selected by whom?  In the case of rape, the mother makes no selection.  Also, I think that if you leave the fetus with no donors, it just gets aborted.  See, you are already assuming in your hypothetical that the woman will be forced to carry an unwanted fetus to term.  However, we were not looking at that part of the argument, just how surrogate mothers resemble organ donors.  
BabyBumps X I know you don't want to hear this but...  There aren't any signs you're about to go into labor that aren't just plain signs of being 3rd trimester. And you could be in this pre-labor for weeks yet if they don't induce you.  But remember...   You're very unlikely to have a precipitous labor (one that happens so fast you have no time to get to the hospital). They happen, yes... but they are so very rare.   When you're in labor, you'll know. And you'll know with plenty of time to get to the hospital.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; I'll tell you why I disagree with this point. In the vast majority of cases the woman has elected to get pregnant and has hence created a being that relies completely on her body. Because she has brought this being to life I believe it is fair to say that she cannot end its life through abortion.  Why?  Even if she chooses to become pregnant (abortions from wanted pregnancies are so incredibly rare I don't understand why you chose the words you did).  But what about an organism makes existence worth protecting?  I see no difference from never existing to existing for 1 month as an embryo and being terminated.    If a baby was born without enough brain function to experience but enough to keep the rest of the body alive, would you think society should be legally obligated to sustain it for eternity?
TwoXChromosomes X 1. Slow it down. I know for me my lady parts need some recovery time, sometimes a few days, and "5-6 times in 3 days" would hurt like hell even if I was otherwise enjoying it.  2. Lots of foreplay! LOTS.  3. More lube. More lube lube lube. Try various brands as some might be irritating you (for me, that Durex Play Cherry stuff felt like my lady parts were on fire, for example).  4. If you're using condoms, make sure the lube is safe for them *and* make sure the condoms are safe for *you.* You might be allergic to them or the spermicide.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Actually they're not - but that's a whole other problem all in itself. Wanted pregnancies are in fact sometimes terminated because of medical issues, either for the woman or for the fetus.  Change my sentence to read "elective abortions" or for non-medical reasons.  &gt; The problem is, that pro-life is often even against those - even if the child would be born heavily damaged or if the mother could die, which is just a whole new level of awful.  Every pro-life stance I've ever heard has mother's health exemptions.  Which of course is interesting since a mother has health risks if she continues the pregnancy.  Pro-life doesn't have much logical consistency without the axiom that for some reason an organism's life is sacred from conception.  But I haven't seen much defense for that axiom to use as the basis for a law forcing women to sustain the fetus.  
TwoXChromosomes X 1. Totally normal. You're using something you've never used in that way before. You have to break it in (kind of like a new shoe - weird imagery, but there it is).  2. Lots of lube/foreplay.  3. Slow. It. Down.  Give yourself time in between sessions (I would recommend a day or so) until it doesn't hurt when you're having sex every other day. Then you can increase frequency. (1 day is an arbitrary amount of time - do what feels ok to you.)  4. Relax. Most of us have been here. It does get better! Also, congrats on the sex!!!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;So in your hypothetical future, women should be punished because no one wants their embryo?   What recourse does a mother have if she doesn't want her child and has no place to put it? I think the same would apply, yes.   Abortion is termination and overreaches my understanding of bodily autonomy. More accurate would be the right to remove anything from her body at any time. That doesn't mean terminate, even if it is 100% assured. Your autonomy stops where another one's begins. Get it out of your body if you want, and it'll die in the open air. Kill it so that you can then remove it? Not buying that argument. 
TwoXChromosomes X There are lots of women who do kill themselves after getting pregnant, including one woman (recently) who was jailed for attempted feticide (after a failed suicide attempt.)  So I'll repeat my earlier statement, there are women who rather die (or risk death) rather than be pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X actually, chicken eggs occasionally undergo parthenogenesis, which means that a viable (yet sterile) chicken could actually be born from an unfertilized egg.  science is awesome
TwoXChromosomes X Like...you mean, you're a child of a mother who was forced to carry you to term even though she didn't want to and now your parent(s) support you against their will, or are you a parent who would have wanted to abort (assuming you are female here, I don't really know), was not allowed to, and now have to pay child care support even though you really do not wish to care for the child? Or did you mean sth entirely different when you said 'everyday reality'?  
beyondthebump X  Ny little chap was born August 2nd, weighing a whopping 3120g which converts to 6lbs 14oz give or take.  He was 52 cms, which is 20.5inches,   He lost 10oz in the first few days of life, and has since put on 11 so he currently weighs one ounce more than his birth weight.   He is breastfed and literally feeds all day. I'm really tired, but it's good to know that he's gaining well. 
TwoXChromosomes X Well, many pro-lifers believe that abortion is always immoral, regardless of how conception took place. They believe this because they believe a fetus is equivalent to an adult. So for those people the analogy is sound.  However, no one chooses to get pregnant, you merely choose to assume various levels of risk that this will happen. You can add the risk (ranging from 10%- .1%) into the analogy if you like.   Edit: To make the analogy close, say that everyone knows that every time they have sex there is a 10% risk, or if they take certain measures a .1% risk, that a person will be surgically attached to them in the night and they will be required to sustain that person or the person will die.  
TwoXChromosomes X That's exactly the opposite of what you've been saying, though. Saying that women can't have abortions because they somehow "agreed" to get pregnant by having sex (they didn't) is forcing a child on a woman as punishment for behaviour that you personally find unacceptable. There's nothing wrong with having consensual sex, and having consensual sex does not mean that someone wants to have a baby. And really, "take someone's life"? And embryo isn't a life, it's a cluster of growing cells. A fetus is arguably a life, but why should it have more rights than I do? It requires my energy, time, body, and nourishment to grow: it functions the same way a parasite does. *Certain life* should be protected before *agrueable life* is.  I'd like to remind you that pregnancy requires two people. So while I'm having a parasite-like potential life growing inside me for 9 months, what "punishment" befalls the man who got me pregnant?
TwoXChromosomes X That's been used frequently as a "slippery slope" argument against pro-choice philosophies.  Namely when you qualify the fetus as not being in possession of person-hood (as many do), then typically a newborn will be considered not a person either.  Obviously, the main rebuttal is that you can give the newborn up for adoption and have it no longer be a drain on the mother's resources, thus the argument isn't pro-infanticide when it is pro-choice.  Just a random aside that I thought interesting/relevant.
BabyBumps X If you're dilated enough and close enough to/past the due date, it's the first/easiest way to try to kick-start labor. From the wikipedia page about labor induction: "Membrane sweep" .... during an internal examination, the midwife moves her finger around the cervix to stimulate and/or separate the membranes around the baby from the cervix. This causes a release of prostaglandins which can help to kick-start labor.   It wasn't comfortable for sure, and it caused some crampy feelings and bleeding. It was over really fast though, and for anyone considering it, it's really not too bad. She was already "in there" to check my cervix anyway. It's definitely nothing to dread. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;i think the hidden assumption in this question is that the fetus is even "alive". if we can somehow define when a fetus becomes alive, then this question will be easier to answer. because you can only kill something that lives...right  Well, I was intending to use 'alive' in the biological sense, not any sort of moral sense; I think it's unexceptional to call a foetus 'alive' in the same sense that a bacterium, a brain cell or a cancerous tumour is 'alive'.  When it attains some sort of moral agency (and so can be thought of as having rights and responsibilities) is a possibly tricky and definitely loaded question.
TwoXChromosomes X See the organ donor analogy.  Even if you stab someone in the kidney, the state values your right to your own body above forcing you to give that person your kidney.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; It's not holding your rights over mine to say I can't murder you because that's not a right that I had to begin with.  It is if I just start sucking your blood for life support! You're free to kill me then, because that is self-defense. I'd be happy to let a fetus live if it would just get the fuck out of my uterus. But the thing is, the fetus and the woman aren't separate entities, so it's not the same as just murdering somebody who is minding their own business.
Parenting X I can't imagine 1 month in the NICU - we had to do 1 week with my first and it was heartbreaking. Congrats on having him home and healthy! 
TwoXChromosomes X I think "abortion as birth control" is mostly an anti-choice propaganda construction.  The one woman who I knew had an abortion (and was open about it), suffered contraceptive failure and had a lot of inner turmoil over aborting the fetus (even though she had medical reasons to abort).  I know it's anecdotal, but I've met very few people who are blas about abortion.  "Abortion as birth control", as a phenomenon, has existed in some very specific cases (like in some part of Soviet Russia because ironically abortions were easier to come by than contraceptives) - but it's a pretty rare phenomenon.  There's a lot of reasons why unwanted pregnancies occur - like failing birth control, lack of sex ed for young people, coercion to have unprotected sex by a partner, limited access to contraceptives because if financial or other reasons..etc.  Bottom line is: you don't know how a woman got pregnant, nor why she's aborting.  Sure, there might be women out there who are really blas or irresponsible about it - but I strongly believe this is a vast minority.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;It's human. But cancer is also human, so we're perfectly fine with killing human cells.  There is no benefit to society in protecting these kinds of life forms. There never has been. There is no cultural or historical precedent for it.  There *is* a cultural and historical precedent for protecting a human life. Pro-lifers believe an embryo is a human life. I agree. I don't agree that it's worth protecting.  I am more convinced than ever that you are trying to rationalize an embryo not *really* being a human life because you find the thought distasteful. Either way, I'm done discussing this. It doesn't matter. Regardless of whether or not it's a human life, it should not be legally protected and should therefore be the mother's decision when it comes to abortion.
AskWomen X I also have the copper IUD, inserted after having a kid.  My periods are heavier than they were before I had a kid, but I was on Ortho Tricyclene for 10 years prior to getting pregnant and that may have been another reason my periods are now heavier.  I still love having a copper IUD though.  No pill to remember, condom to wear (unless you are concerned about STDs), no hormones to worry about affecting your sex drive or other functions.
TwoXChromosomes X While this thought experiment might be "better" as a workaround for people that refuse to take a fetus as not a living thing, it's still logically inconsistent with the rest of how we view these things. That analogy isn't similar enough to an abortion. It's creating a highly specific scenario and ignoring very key differences that would affect the ethics of the decision. Actively killing someone is different than not keeping them alive.
TwoXChromosomes X Different markers on the same spectrum as far as I'm concern. I would not go so far as to force organ use, but would compel some physical act out of the person. Similarly (if you are comparing this to a pregnancy) I would not condone killing the fetus, I would *want* her to make a reasonable effort to ensure its survival though. But, if she was completely unwilling to do so she is free to remove the fetus (without termination). 
BabyBumps X I did IVF and they couldn't find the heartbeat until I was almost 7 weeks. It is possible that your pregnancy isn't viable, or it is also quite possible that it is just too early to find the heartbeat. It seems like a good indication that they are having you come back next week for another one. Hope you get to see the little flicker then!
TwoXChromosomes X The only side effects I've had are the complete loss of my period and the increase of body odor/sweat production. Which I didn't realize until about a month ago when I mentioned it to a family member who asked if it was caused by any medicine I was taking. After some research, apparently a very small percentage of women on Depo get that. But everyone is different so everyone will have varying side effects. That's why doctors encourage you to find one that works for you!
BabyBumps X Please enjoy not working. If I didn't have to I so wouldn't, I'm on my feet all day and it is taking a huge toll on my body.  You are so lucky!!!
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;i also think the mother should hold the decision whether to truly terminate the fetus or allow it to continue to live elsewhere.  What's your justification for that? The mother gains the right to evict the foetus due to bodily autonomy concerns, why should she have the right to decide to kill (as in intentionally kill it, not merely cause it to die as a side-effect of evicting it) it?  Does the father (who, tenancy issues aside, has a near equal part in the foetus' creation) also have the right to kill the foetus? When do these rights extend? If we're stipulating them as rights independent to the right to evict, there doesn't seem to be sound reason to end them at birth, so this is starting to look like it's more like the mother (or parents) have property rights over their child.  If you have rights to kill, do you then have rights to sell (either as a going concern or for parts)?  IMO there's more to the moral arguments around abortion than a lot of people on either side of the fence give credit for.  My personal feelings about abortion are from the 'collision of bodily autonomy to rights to life' school of things; I don't believe that a woman has the right to kill a foetus, but she does have a right to evict it; this has implications for late-term abortion, how I feel about things like using abortion for birth-control and so on.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;What's your justification for that?   she created the organism, so doesn't she have the right to destroy it?  same thing goes for the father.  i've actually pondered *why* infanticide is necessarily wrong.  like i said before, when does a human being gain consciousness?  self-awareness?  when do they become a "moral agent", as you put it?  i think it is at this point that killing becomes necessarily wrong- before this, i'm still undecided.  &gt;I don't believe that a woman has the right to kill a foetus, but she does have a right to evict it  that's really interesting.  i've actually never thought about it that way.  but, with current technology, eviction == killing, so they're effectively the same.  but i like that you even made a distinction in the first place.
TwoXChromosomes X I once saw a nurse practitioner who was extremely peppy during the entire exam. She was feeling inside of me and saying, "There's your uterus!" in an excited voice. It was so awkward. Other than that, I agree that it's really nice to hear why they are doing what they do.  : )  
BabyBumps X Best case scenario, tomorrow. Worst case? No one has ever been pregnant forever. ;).  Seriously though, my constant nausea ended at 10-11 weeks. Suddenly. I woke up and I haven't been nauseous like that since. So it really could be any day. :). 
BabyBumps X Aww!!  So sweet!  :). And best of luck at your appt.  I totally hope you get to hear the heartbeat but remember it is early to hear it through the Doppler so don't worry if you don't!  :). 
BabyBumps X When I started to consistently measure big, at around 36 weeks, my doctor sent me for an ultrasound to check the size of baby. Turns out I have too much amniotic fluid. At no point was my due date ever thought of being changed. Ultrasounds before 12 weeks may be accurate enough to date by size, but babies grow at different rates so redating at 20 plus weeks could be wrong...   This is just my understanding. :)
BabyBumps X At my 31 week appt, I measured 34 weeks. Today, at 33 weeks, I measured 31. Eh. I really, really doubt my baby has shrunk 3cm in 2 weeks. 
TwoXChromosomes X The point is that you don't need to decide when personhood "begins", all you need to realize is that there is an entity that requires your body for life. Legally speaking, even if this entity is legally recognized as a separate human with its own human rights, our society has determined that it would still not be able to utilize your body in such a manner against your consent. So it doesn't matter where personhood begins, because this argument is valid even if one considers a zygote to fit under the philosophical and legal definition of personhood.   The philosophical debate of personhood is a rabbit hole that no pro choice individual needs to go down. This argument is far more persuasive in my opinion.  &gt;Also, you wouldn't apply this same logic to a third trimester baby, would you?   Why wouldn't you? If you can apply the logic to a fully developed human entity, why can't you to a 3rd trimester fetus? I think you're probably bringing that point up because you've bought into the anti-choice framing of the discussion. Abortion = death of the fetus in all cases. This is simply not true.  Abortion is defined as the early termination of the pregnancy. This means they can terminate the pregnancy early even in late terms whilst still saving the fetus. 
BabyBumps X A mini-laparotomy is a small surgical incision into the abdomen. That's all it means. It can be used for removal of ovarian cysts, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, etc. There are lots of possibilities, with different recovery times.
TwoXChromosomes X If you're the only match to save an individuals life (while still preserving yours), no one has the legal authority to rob you of your bodily autonomy. 
BabyBumps X My doctor felt mine at 8 weeks and though my lmp said I should be 12 weeks or so, he guessed I was 6-7 weeks. He was only about a week off, but keeping that in mind, it seems like that early, the uterus size isn't really a set in stone thing... Just my thoughts, I'm not a doctor. Besides, 6.5 weeks is only like, three weeks with child technically, I don't think there would be all that drastic a change that early. But again, just my thoughts, not a doctor.
BabyBumps X You know, I've been feeling these awful rumbles like I was going to have diarrhea for a couple of weeks (just every now and then) but I figured it was just another pregnancy thing since I'd been constipated for so long! Maybe my body was telling me this was coming :-(.   Still on the zofran, and from my experience I'd take constipation over this any day. 
BabyBumps X Her twin died at birth, sadly. The doctors say he had down syndrome so he may have had a heart condition.
TwoXChromosomes X They're illegal because there's a huge risk for the mother, not because of morality questions. So the whole 5min abortion before birth is irrelevant.  And afaik, if you for some reason cannot bare a child (medical circumstances), and you're in the third trimester, the kid won't get aborted. In most cases premature kids die though.
BabyBumps X I was just coming here to post about this same thing! It's hard to lift a leg to climb into bed, to get into my car, even to put panties on! And I have been worried that the sharper pains were from an undiagnosed bladder infection, but I saw my midwife yesterday and everything's fine, apparently. She explained that with the baby's head now being positioned lower that I'll feel that general pain there all the time because of ligaments stretching around my lower pelvis and cervix, if I remember correctly. The sudden stabs of pain are related and normal as well, just pretty shocking when they happen (they make me stop walking and take my breath away). I'm also getting "engorged" down below because the weight and pressure of my belly and uterus are restricting more normal blood flow around my lower abdomen. Oh the joys of turning 37 weeks! It crept up on me, I didn't think I'd be feeling this way yet.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Uhm, what I'm saying is that if it can survive without the woman's body there is no reason to kill it. Abortion usually means you kill the fetus.  I know, but why is "viable" the line at which we're deciding not to end its life? I mean, if this is an ethical issue for you, science has gotten to the point that we can grow children artificially. There's no reason to let any fetus or embryo die then.  &gt;I think it's unnecessary to kill a fetus just because you can. I'm sure most doctors would rather do an early delivery than kill it if they had that choice.   I guess I just don't see the moral difference between killing an embryo and killing viable fetus, since we have the technology that all healthy unborn children are viable. You're ending a human life either way. You were willing to end this life two months ago, and I don't see why you'd be any less willing to end it today.  What I'm saying is I don't think the "viable" case is a very strong argument.
TwoXChromosomes X I think it would be a moral decision made by the person donating the kidney.  I think it would be unethical to remove the power from them, considering that it is not your health at stake but theirs.  &gt;Also, how is a living fetus ethically different from a living child?  For one, it doesn't have a name nor a cultural identity.  For another, it is a whole different class of entity.  If we are granting fetuses full personhood rights, we need to reconcile the fact that CHILDREN don't get full personhood rights - they are legally subordinate to their parents.    If you think of a woman's body as property, she has full ownership and gets to decide how and when to use her property.  A fetus is making a claim on her property - if she does not want to grant use of her property to the fetus, then it is her call to make.  Her claim to her body would supersede the fetus's, because she has had it for longer.
beyondthebump X We planned for a vasectomy as well but you may want to consider the Mirena IUD. Just as effective with a chance of losing your periods. It lasts 5 years and works with breastfeeding.    I'm getting mine in this month. 
BabyBumps X I had SPD bad with my last two pregnancies and managed giving birth both times perfectly fine, at home, with no drugs. I gave birth the first two times without SPD, in the hospital, no drugs.  Honestly the only difference I found was that after giving birth, walking to the bathroom made me cry. Not out of pain but out of relief of finally walking without severe pain!  I second the chiropractor suggestion, they will keep your pelvis aligned, when it is out of alignment it REALLY hurts.  Also second the support belt, at the end it made the difference between being able to go shopping with or without a wheelchair. I required a wheelchair without it, it hurt that bad.  Also:  keep legs together as much as possible. Getting into bed, sit on the bed and swing both legs up at the same time. Getting in a car, sit in the car and then swing both legs in together at the same time.  when lifting, do not straddle lift.  do not step over things.  take stairs one step at a time.  Floating is extreme but temporary relief. Be sure not to kick your legs, that will hurt. In the pool, I honestly could forget just how bad the SPD was. It made getting out very hard, as soon as my stomach wasn't being supported by the water I nearly fell over from the pain.  Avoid motions that require twisting at the waist... mopping or vaccuming... if possible do them seated or have your significant other do it. the twisting can throw the alignment of your pelvis off, causing it to hurt worse (sweeping is what made it get really bad for me the first time)  If you are going to be on your feet a lot, take a lot of breaks.
BabyBumps X I went in for my dating ultrasound about two weeks sooner than I had estimated (thought I was 8w 2d, was barely over 6). We didn't see a thing except the gestational sac but doc didn't seem concerned and didn't even schedule another u/s. But my little booger ended up being fine. Heard him on the doppler at appointments and last week saw him for the first real time (at 22w)! Don't freak out. It was probably just too early and at least you get another u/s soon and can see your jelly bean :)
TwoXChromosomes X When I had my Mirena, I had 3 week long periods. I got removed after 1.5 years. I couldn't deal with the constant bleeding.
TwoXChromosomes X You are still not addressing the issue. The question you aren't answering is,  assuming the fetus does have rights, "does the right of the mother not to aid the fetus supersede the fetus' right not to be killed." I err on the side of choice in these debates, but it's not ridiculous to say we should fight for those who can't fight for themselves.  I agree with most that the right is too fanatical on this issue and for the wrong reasons. To use the extreme, most people aren't in favor of voluntary partial birth abortion...but where do you draw the line? At some point can't we decide a woman has had enough time to evict her deadbeat tennant and is stuck with it for a few months?
AskWomen X Well, at least you don't have to worry about diseases. That is a big worry for me even with condoms. Skin to skin contact transfers herpes and hpv, for instance. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;You want your baby to have the best life you can give it, which is not something you can give right now.  Thank you. This is true, and exactly why we're waiting. The hardest part is that I really *am* ready emotionally. We've chosen our lives to involve continuing education, and we don't regret that. It's the right decision for us. I think if my period were late I would freak out a lot, but I'd also be really excited, and also terrified of course! But you're right, we're working hard to get ourselves in a good place in life, both financially and emotionally, and I know that if I have a choice, then now is not the best time. I know that waiting even a couple of years will make a world of difference in both our quality of life, and my child's. 
BabyBumps X I know in the states they can't not hire you because you're pregnant. But we also have no mandated maternity leave at all. So most companies don't even offer it. Amd if you're like me you don't qualify for fmla because of the short amount of time you'll actually be working. Not sure how canada is though. But I would say kust go in there like nothing is wrong be very professional and obviously if she asks you if you are pregnant answer truthfully. Hopefully she has a child and can understand you
TwoXChromosomes X Its really not that bad! When I go for a pap, the whole procedure takes about five minutes- and that includes getting the actual procedure, the breast examination (which your doc may not do, I'm not sure if every ob/gyn does it) and getting dressed.   Here's the procedure: 1. Get undressed, put a robe on, lay down in the stirrups  2. Doctor will potentially do a breast exam.  3. Doctor will insert the speculum and take the samples. A little uncomfortable but I wouldn't say "painful."  4. Doctor will potentially feel around with fingers and press down on your pelvis to make sure there's no lumps, etc.  5. Doctor will leave and you get dressed.  6. Doctor may or may not come back in to discuss the exam.
TwoXChromosomes X It's possible you have endometriosis, ovarian cysts, low iron levels, or thyroid issues. All very easy to treat, especially if caught early, but you HAVE to go to a gynocologist to get things checked out. Make sure they test your thyroid levels- low energy levels, long or heavy periods, feeling sluggish- are all signs of of hypothyroidism. One more note- my aunt was recently hospitalized after having a month long period- her blood levels were critically low and she endangered her organs. In the future, please get help before losing so much blood.
BabyBumps X This is perfectly normal! I took pregnancy tests all the time, my doctor did blood tests and everything was fine. I had my first ultrasound at 8 weeks and was completely convinced i would be told there was nothing there. I had my next US at 13 weeks and went through the same thing again. I had an ultrasound yesterday and was worried something would be wrong! It happens to all of us :)
beyondthebump X I tried...  But neither of my kids took to a pacifier.  My son would suck on my pinky for months.
BabyBumps X I could feel soft outside kicks by 19 weeks, I had alien belly by 21.  Unfortunately though my daughter is a troll and absolutely no one has felt her move besides me.  I've lost hope by this point.
BabyBumps X I'm 18 weeks today and still only feeling things of the "am I imagining this, or is it something?" kind. My midwife says my placenta is anterior and I can expect to feel things later than I would otherwise. It also makes for some nervous (on my part) times while she's looking for the baby's heartbeat with the Doppler!
AskWomen X My cure: taking AZO Yeast probiotics, sleeping naked, not taking baths until they were gone for months (just showers), wearing cotton underwear (no thongs for the first few months), cutting down on the amount of sugar I was eating, and lowering my stress/anxiety levels.  Also note that if they're coming and going, it may be just that you aren't getting rid of them entirely. 
BabyBumps X The Northgate JC Penneys in Seattle just clearanced all of theirs and got rid of the maternity section. :( I really liked the Duo brand pants I have gotten as hand me downs. The few Targets that have maternity sections around here have such a goddamn terrible selection that it's not even worth trying. Basically I'm stuck with Motherhood Maternity or driving an hour up to the only Old Navy with a maternity section that has free parking. Sucktastic.
TwoXChromosomes X If you start the first Sunday of your period, I believe you are protected from day one...at least that's what mine works under. You should wait a week though, call your doctor.
BabyBumps X I had severe nausea in the beginning weeks and it just stopped overnight one night.  I was so worried about feeling normal.  Everything was absolutely fine :)
TwoXChromosomes X Took me a while to get used to the idea - it just seemed super gross.  But that's just because I was used the concept of pads and tampons.  If a small silicone cup of catching the blood and keeping it separate from the body without interfering with natural lubrication seems gross how disgusting is a great wad of cotton stuck inside you or in your pants soaking up the blood.    You know that awful feeling of a bloody pad - not an issue. You know when you're flow is more clots than flow and doesn't soak onto the tampon so you have to pull out a dry tampon with a great big clot on the end - not an issue.  You know when you need to use the toilet and you have to decide to change the tampon now even though its not been in for very long or hold the string out of the way - not an issue.  You know when the blood seems to follow the crack of your vulva and buttocks instead of going straight into the pad and ruins your underwear - not an issue.   I could go on but I'm sure you've got the idea. The big issue is the idea of emptying the cup of blood. But that's only because you've forgotten how much you've already normalised.   Empty it in my morning and evening shower - blood washes away. More comfortable and easier to insert than a tampon with a similar learning curve (think back ...) and way better than a pad.   I will let my boyfriend go down on me during my period with it. Something I don't feel comfortable doing with a tampon.  
BabyBumps X Yeah i'm hoping for 9 but i'm thinking i'm probably closer to 8 ish 
beyondthebump X I haven't ruled out Mirena, I'm just trying to look at all of my options.  I don't want to have to worry every month about something going wrong, or being the 1% that still gets pregnant.  I know that Mirena is supposed to be more efficient than the pill, but my mom got pregnant on the pill and I don't want any surprises.
TwoXChromosomes X Not necessarily.  You could basically consider the fetus being on life support.  In which case the pregnant woman is (unwilling) life support.  A fetus also has an underdeveloped brain, up to the point you could compare them to a braindead patient.  Basically abortion is cutting life support (without which it cannot live).
TwoXChromosomes X There is no way to tell if the virus is present and dormant or if things have run their course and it's gone forever. Not for men, anyway. If you don't have warts, and haven't for at least 1-2 years, your body has probably rid yourself of the virus.  As for the vaccine, the way my MD put it to me was that it's "the biggest thing for womens health since the pap smear." And she's right. Your girl should be vaccinated even if you two never decide to do the deed.
BabyBumps X I'm ten weeks too! Mine is still just flab from pre-baby beer, so I am super jealous of your cute bump.
TwoXChromosomes X Well I'm assuming the person in need of the kidney isn't the person that took out my kidney and put it inside. For this whole rape baby analogy to work you need three parties. me/mother, surgeon/rapist, and patient/fetus. So I'd be prosecuting the surgeon/rapist in the scenario.  Nobody has the right to force me to save a life, but I have no right to take a life. So, if my inaction causes a person to die it's unfortunate but morally sound. But if I perform an action that does cause a person to die, that I am morally at fault for. That's the law I'm drawing, not saving a life is ethically sound, but ending a life is not. Do you see the difference?  So say there's some accident where a woman and her baby get stuck in a room for a week. The baby is too young to eat food, which there happens to be plenty of but no formula. The woman refuses to breast feed the baby because bodily autonomy and the baby dies. You're saying that isn't child neglect under the eyes of the law? Also, how exactly does anyone take care of kids without using their body?
TwoXChromosomes X Oh, I see. Well in that case, yeah I understand that consciousness and personhood are kind of a matter of subjectivity. I'd argue that while it is subjective, the majority of society does seem to have clear criteria for what qualifies something for personhood and what the ethics are around that. For instance intelligence and self awareness seems to be a huge factor. Even fully grown adults with diminished capacity are seen as more childlike or in extreme cases "vegetables". Even the pro life movement banks largely on concepts of potential or a god given right to life as opposed to taking a fetus as being akin to an individual human being.  Which I think is why I feel so strongly about this conversation, because not only do I strongly disagree about the notion that a fetus is a person, but also with the idea that bodily autonomy trumps another person's right to life. The kidney situation raises an interesting question for that idea, but I don't believe it is truly applicable to abortion for the reasons I've listed.   But taking the kidney issue on it's own, I feel that there is some degree of moral obligation. Not to the degree that anyone could force you to do it, but to the degree that I would feel guilty if I were to refuse someone a kidney knowing I was the only person who could save them. But when it comes to whether it was akin to murder, or whether it would justify another person forcing me to give the kidney, I believe that it would not.  If the person already had my kidney though, I would view taking it out against their will to be murder. If you could figure out a way to take it out and not kill them though, I'd say they'd have to give it back to me.
BabyBumps X I'm 5'2" and I started having pain in my ribs at 27/28 weeks. Sucks :(  I don't think it was the baby itself at that time, I think the uterus was just pushing everything up and my ribs were expanding to make room for other organs. 30 weeks now and it's definitely the baby that hurts lol. I asked my midwife and she had no idea what I was talking about and said that I should never feel anything in my ribs. :/ I don't think I really like her that much. 
BabyBumps X I can't remember exactly when but I know it was before 30 weeks that I could get kicked in the ribs. However, the pain wasn't constant, it would only last until she shifted positions. But I was/am carrying quite high. 
TwoXChromosomes X Absolutely agree with Nutterbutter's comment.  I'd also ask if the doctor was comfortable with placing IUDs in women who have not given birth (nulliparous) if that applies to you.  Many doctors place IUDs but some are less comfortable with placing them in nulliparous women....or refuse to.  So it's best to check! 
TwoXChromosomes X My point is you could.  You could remove a fetus in one piece, and it would die, because it's incapable of living on it's own.
TwoXChromosomes X Taking it perfectly means taking it at the same time every day and, if you do forget a pill, to wait the appropriate amount of time before having sex again to make sure the hormones are at their proper levels to stop pregnancy. Just read the birth control directions carefully. Using the birth control correctly means that 2% of women may get pregnant after one year of frequent, consistent sex. It doesn't mean that you will get pregnant twice for every 100 times you have sex. If you use birth control in conjunction with the pulling-out method (which is surprisingly effective when done correctly, but completely ineffective if done at all incorrectly), you should be covered.
BabyBumps X Mine does exactly this, in exactly the same spot. And if she doesn't have her little baby bum poked out and I rub and press my hand against that spot more than 90% of the time she'll stuck her bum out for me. I love it. It's like pre delivery cuddling. :)
BabyBumps X You can do it! Pain isn't really that bad, because our bodies release natural opiates. The hardest thing for me was having no energy to push because I didn't eat enough. My SO gave me a chocolate energy chunk during, and it gave me the fuel to get the baby out. I loved it and would recommend that everyone do it! Women are very powerful and amazing creatures, if we couldn't birth naturally, none of us would be here. Check out the site for nice info: [Birth Without Fear]( )
AskWomen X Ortho-tri-cylen lo sucked for me.  I had a lot of spotting between my periods, which defeated the purposed of me going on the pill in the first place.  Hormone swings, acne, and weight gain are all common side effects of hormonal treatment though.  If you're unhappy you need to talk to your doctor and figure out another prescription.  It took me 4 different tries I think before I settled on the pill I take now.
BabyBumps X i was complaining about my back and sciatic pain last week to my doctor. they've suggested i see a chiropractor. yaye for tuesday, hopefully i will get some relief. 
BabyBumps X I've correctly nursed two babies and I must disagree- even correctly latched (as confirmed by LCs) your nipples absolutely will be sore for he first 3-5 days or so as they adjust to their new role. Saying that there is no pain involved unless you are doing it wrong is misleading and a disservice to first time moms. It takes some getting used to and gel soothies 100% help to through those first few days.
TwoXChromosomes X I am having trouble finding the text of the original definition of gestational age. Without that, I feel uncomfortable with the claim that this is a change to how it is calculated.  &gt;average length of pregnancy, or gestation, is calculated as 40 weeks."  This implies, does it not, that the "gestational age" of the fetus is the same as the length of the pregnancy?
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Pregnancy Begins 2 Weeks Before Conception  This is a really poor way to put it.  Conception is fertilization, union of sperm and egg to produce a zygote.  One can't be pregnant until this happens.
BabyBumps X Oh and the dull ache may just be your uterus getting ready for the baby - growing, accommodating the embryo &amp; forming placenta, etc. I had period-like cramping fairly steadily for a few weeks.
BabyBumps X I hope things work out for you. :).  And at my 13 and a half week ultrasound, she did move a little. And it was super cool. But at my 12 week doctors appointment, I didn't get an ultrasound but I did get to hear her heartbeat which was kinda cool. My favorite part was the anatomy ultrasound at 20 weeks and watching her little heart pump. You could see it in so much detail. It was truly amazing. And the first time I had a wow, I'm growing an entire human moment!  I can't wait to hear how your appointment went. 
TwoXChromosomes X I do a semi-squat and squeeze the bottom to reduce suction, then I do a funny hip-wiggle until I feel it come loose! Then when it's down lower I can slide up nearer the top to get it out without it hurting. Don't squeeze too hard though or you will have a mess on your hands (literally).
TwoXChromosomes X Bear down as you remove it, also could try hooking your finger up to the edge and releasing the suction fully that way (could be messy though)
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; So here's a twist, if you were giving life support someone and they are dependent on it, are you allowed to just quit on a whim?  Again, if you'd read the violinist thought experiment, that's taken into consideration. The scenario is that you wake up and discover that you HAVE been abducted and hooked up to the violinist against your will, and he'll die unless you stay there for nine months. I think most of us feel like you'd be within your rights to go "Um, no" and walk away.  I believe the scenario also specifies that it's the violinist's *friends* who hooked you up to him; he didn't do it himself. So again, the person whose life depends on yours didn't make a conscious choice to violate your bodily integrity ... but I don't think that'd make most people go, "Well, that's OK then, he didn't *mean* to hurt you so you have to stay there."  Parental responsibility seems like a more solid objection to the thought experiment. I think philosophers disagree about whether we have different ethical responsibilities to different people depending on our relationships and station in life.  &gt; But it's really selfish to only apply that to yourself and not the baby.  Well, for the sake of discussion I've been accepting the claim that a fetus is actually a person. I don't actually think that. In the event that I were considering a first-trimester abortion, I would be weighing my wellbeing against the wellbeing of something with the cognitive capacity of an oyster and no ability to feel pain. And, while I'm apparently less anthropocentric than you -- I'm a vegetarian -- I think I wouldn't feel a lot of remorse about killing an oyster to preserve my own health and wellbeing.
BabyBumps X I recently read that as much as two drinks PER DAY has been shown to have no effect on a pregnancy or the health of a child.  I certainly won't be have two drinks every day myself, but it makes me feel much better about having the occasional beer or glass of wine.  Have a beer!  Or half a beer, if that would be easier on your conscience.  You will be fine. 
TwoXChromosomes X Thank you!   I was considering it (or the shot) for a while, but never really took the plunge until recently, when I went to my doctor to get a new pill prescription. He said I should have never been on them because I get migraines. I was already a little wary of taking hormonal pills because I have a slight heart problem, but that's been okay'd by doctors before. 
BabyBumps X During my first trimester all my symptoms randomly went away one day and didn't come back for about a week. I should have just enjoyed not feeling sick those few days, but instead I spent the week worrying. It ended up being fine!
BabyBumps X I wouldn't worry about it. I was measuring 30 weeks when I was 35 and the next week when I went in, I measured right on point. My doctor told me the baby probably moved to a weird position and since I am smaller, they weren't really concerned. They did an ultrasound anyway to check that the baby was developing fine, asked me if he was still kicking (and he is, like a beast!) and sent me on my way.
TwoXChromosomes X Missing a pill at the end of your cycle is the worst time to miss it. I definitely suggest calling a pharmacist to ask. But if I were you, I wouldn't consider myself protected until I took an entire pack of pills and got my period again. Although I'm extra paranoid about this kind of stuff...but it's better safe than sorry.
BabyBumps X Time is counting down.  My midwife is coming over on Tues to give me a 'cocktail' of ingredients that she says has a high chance of sending me into labour.  If that doesn't work, I'm scheduled for an induction on Thurs.
BabyBumps X I've got hyperemesis. I've been so done with this for a couple of weeks now. The latest statistic I read was that 20% of HG sufferers continue with HG through the entire pregnancy. I don't know how anyone with HG would willingly get pregnant a second time. I don't like my odds for this continuing for the next 6 months, and drs/nurses who don't know the statistics keep telling me I'll feel better in a couple of weeks. I can only hope so, otherwise I'm going to go insane. 
BabyBumps X Bleeding during pregnancy should never be considered "normal." However, a statistically significant percentage of women will experience bleeding at some point during the pregnancy. Many women experience spotting early in the pregnancy when the embryo implants in the uterine lining. This implantation bleeding may be accompanied by mild cramping.   Women are diagnosed with subchorionic hematomas in approximately 3% of pregnancies. A hematoma is basically a bruise along the lining of the uterus. It can be seen on ultrasound as a large black area just next to the pregnancy. These hematomas can resolve with no bleeding, or may cause bleeding throughout the duration of the pregnancy. Many resolve by 12 weeks, and most resolve by 20 weeks. If a hematoma is resolving, you will often experience copious amounts of old brown blood, significant clotting and cramping. Your healthcare provider may recommend bed rest and will remind you to drink plenty of water. The size of the hematoma seems to be a big factor in how much of a threat it poses to the pregnancy.   The rule of thumb for bleeding is that if it's brown blood, it's probably not an issue. Bright red bleeding is more a cause of concern. Any bleeding accompanied by severe cramping is a definite concern and you should talk to your healthcare provider or head to the hospital.   Most information says that any bleeding in the first trimester means your risk of miscarriage is about 50%. However, if a subchorionic hematoma is involved and a strong heartbeat can be seen on ultrasound, the risk is closer to 10%.   Other causes of bleeding can include a sensitive cervix which can be irritated by anything from sex to a difficult bowel movement, a low-lying placenta, or even hemorrhoids. Bleeding doesn't immediately spell the end of your pregnancy, but should always be checked out. 
BabyBumps X I had spotting the day I turned 6 weeks. It was just enough that when I wiped, it was there. It was bright red, but like I said, not a lot. I was in another state about to board a plane home and I was SO SCARED I was going to miscarry on the plane, but I kept checking, and it just got darker until I could tell it was dried, oxygenated blood. I talked to my doctor about it when I got home (My appointment was at 6wk +4), she said everything looked normal, and only to worry if it continued, got heavier, and was BRIGHT red blood, because that would mean I was actively bleeding. I haven't had it since, and everything is still looking perfect and healthy as of my last ultrasound last Thursday. I hope that helps calm your nerves a bit!
BabyBumps X First, breathe. A bit of spotting is a completely normal occurrence, it happens to a lot of women.  Second, is there a nurse line you can call? If you're that worried you can call them, or even your local L&amp;D. Your midwife should also have an emergency number you can reach her at, even on a Sunday.  Third, breathe some more. Stay hydrated as best as you can, don't exert yourself. Take it easy today.  From what I've read, miscarriages tend to present with cramping and bleeding.  Have you had sex recently, or even a large bowel movement? These can irritate your cervix and cause spotting. Spotting at this stage can also, if I recall correctly, be from the embryo embedded in the uterine lining - the placenta starts to form, things move around, etc.
BabyBumps X Despite the link between reduced HIV/HPV transmission and circumcision, these issues can be resolved through the practice of safe sex - something children should be educated about anyways. As true as these studies may be, (despite the fact that they are widely contested) I don't believe this information provides enough of a reason to support routine amputation of an important part of an infant's penis. 
BabyBumps X Start attending La Leche League meetings now, while you're still pregnant.  Meetings are free and very supportive mom-to-mom help.  I'd recommend waiting 4 weeks before you pump, unless there are unforeseen problems that cause you to be separated from your baby.  Pumping adds work, and you'll have plenty of work with a newborn.  Plus, milk production is supply-and-demand based, and if you pump too much you can give yourself oversupply, which won't be comfortable at all when you return to work.  Once you hit 4 weeks, pump once a day - shoot for pumping in the morning when your supply will be higher. www.workandpump.com is a great site to help you plan for returning to work.  Sometime between 4-6 weeks, introduce a bottle and try to do one at least 2-3 times a week.  However, remember that whenever baby gets a bottle, you need to be pumping at that time.  So if you leave baby with a bottle while you're out somewhere, bring your pump with you.    Talk to WIC - they will supply you with a double electric pump.  Still, a pump is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying formula.  
BabyBumps X Normal things that can cause bleeding include sex (extra blood to cervix and sex can result in some spotting), heavy bowel movements (the bowel and the cervix are near each other anatomically, so a large or impacted bowel movement can irritate the cervix as it passes) and implantation bleeding (occurs in about 1/3 of pregnancies usually seen between weeks 4-8).   Low lying and placenta previa can also be associated with bleeding, and as others have mentioned SCH, twin loss and more unexplained causes.   Bleeding in later pregnancy can also be a sign of placental abruption.  While most of the time bleeding isn't going to be a big deal you should always get it checked.  
TwoXChromosomes X But the "period" you get on BC pills isn't a real period. It's a withdrawal bleed you experience when you stop taking them for the off week.  Your doctor probably meant that not having your period for a year could be a symptom of some other condition that could result in infertility or early menopause, not that the lack of a period itself causes those things.
AskWomen X Why?  Because I'm the one who's body is going to be turned into an incubator for the next 9 months and there's no one on the planet who has a right to force me to do that if I don't want to.    I agree 600% with ErisHeiress, if science can make a way for men to carry a baby that they want when the mother doesn't- then my potential baby daddy can have all the fetuses he wants.  But I'm not giving birth to them if I don't want to.
BabyBumps X I mean I didn't get induced the day after my EDD. we waited another 5 days. My doctor gave me an option. If I had refused to be induced he wouls have began running tests on the baby to see if he was still happy in there or not. 
TwoXChromosomes X OK, let me clarify then. This is how my gyno explained it to me. If you've been menstruating regularly for awhile, then do not have a period for at least a year (if losing your period isn't due to taking birth control, being pregnant, nursing, etc), then there's a good chance that you could start menopause early and lose your fertility, *no matter what the cause of your lack of a period was*. While the period you have on BC isn't a period, you're still maintaining a "cycle" and your body is tricked into thinking not only that you're pregnant, but that you're not drying up. That's why for PCOS sufferers (like me) as well as women who have lost a lot of weight quickly (like OP) who do not have a period naturally and are not trying to get pregnant, it's recommended to go on the pill.  If you're on birth control, pregnant, or nursing, there's no medical need for a period. Otherwise, you should be getting around 4 periods a year. Again, this is what my doctor told me.
AskWomen X Hey, great post, I definitely agree with what you are saying, but I have a of couple questions, and I feel that you probably have some great opinions.  If say, you became pregnant and were considering an abortion, how would the thoughts and feelings of the father impact your decision? Could a man ever persuade you to keep a baby that you don't want to keep? Do you think there is ever a situation where an abortion could be seen as selfish in the part of the woman/mother?   I ask because, while I completely respect that a woman has the right to say what goes on about her body, I am unsure as to how I feel about certain situations.   As men, it takes a large amount of trust on our part to have a baby, because we need to be sure the mother will care for it. If you have no say after conception as to whether the fetus/embryo lives or dies, it must incredibly painful to see your partner abort a potential child you are beginning to love and hope for.   I'm just wondering how you would approach this situation from the point of view of the father, and what you would tell them if you decided to have an abortion.  Thanks so much!
TwoXChromosomes X I do use lube but probably not enough. I have very sensitive skin down there I guess because latex condoms and "fancy" lube also burns a bit. I use Sliquid Oceanics and JO H2O and they both feel good. My bf got Trojan Her Sensation condoms and it was a nightmare. It burned so much and my muscles just clenched tight. No good. Now I use Skyns and they work really well.  
BabyBumps X This is my suggestion as well. I love the heck out of this book.  It doesn't judge you by any choices you make, but rather informs you of what will/may happen no matter what your choices are (whole section for c-sections, whole section for natural pain relief methods, whole section for medicated pain relief... it even covers circumcision without saying one way or the other what "is best" as what is best is up to the parents)
AskWomen X I've had some cramps, and it did change my cycle a little bit, but if you feel really nervous I say go to a doctor just to be on the safe side. I've taken the pill on and off since I was 17 (I am now 20), and every time I've started it again, my period would be wonky for a few months, then it would settle again afterwards. 
TwoXChromosomes X The republican response to this is, "Why are you making this so difficult? If you don't want a baby, just don't have sex. Ever. Even with your husband."  Similar to your situation, there are plenty of mothers who cannot afford another child. Simply cannot do it financially. Repubs don't care. They only care that the life is brought into this world. They don't give two shits what that baby's quality of life is after that.
AskWomen X Sexual recklessness is recklessness on both parts. If she has the option to abort, then so should he, or you're a hypocrite. And since her body's on the line, she deserves abortion. Therefore they both do.  Not to mention that contraception fails.   And if you really think contraceptive deception is that unlikely, you need to do some more research. It's far more common than it should be, especially because society condones it, from women. Yes, a decent woman won't--but women aren't magically more moral than men are. There are plenty of selfish or evil women out there.
TwoXChromosomes X Maybe Todd Akin's legitimate rape will rollover into unwanted pregnancy as well! If you legitametly do not want to become pregnant before you're ready your body will naturally not conceive! On a serious note though, I have to say I agree with your sentiments, after all the people making the decisions on wether or not abortion is allowed are men, who are far far FAR less effected by unwanted pregnancies than women.
Parenting X I'm surprised at that NPR article, and how bombastic the headline was. All the underlying announcement really said was that circumcision has marginal but tangible health benefits (which we already knew, I thought), and that the risks of getting it done are similarly marginal, but the cost of doing so doesn't usually justify the benefits (which I thought we already knew).   I thought the objections to circumcision revolved mostly around the infant's inability to consent to what amounts to a irreversible cosmetic procedure, since by the time most health benefits that can't be duplicated by proper hygiene aren't relevant until the kid is a teenager. I don't think an infant needs to worry about a single-digit decreased likelihood of contracting certain STDs. 
TwoXChromosomes X My first kind of BC pill made me throw up for the first few days of every pack. Other that that, it wasn't too bad, but I had to change it because the place where I got it for free changed the brand they distributed. My second and third BC pills were the best things ever. I have no more PMS, less heavy flow, acne and hair have gone way down... not to mention that my period is finally regular (off the pill I used to go months without a period.) I love my pills and I want to take them forever and ever &lt;3
BabyBumps X I'm just 11 weeks and right about there with you! I've only gained a pound, but I've gained about 7 inches right around my uterus hahaha
TwoXChromosomes X I'd also add that hormonal IUDs have a *much* lower hormone dose than the pill, and they generally result in milder cramps than copper, which is a big thing to consider.   They can also stop periods entirely or almost entirely, which can be a *huge* plus or a *huge* stress-factor, depending.  So - even if you react badly to the pill, don't rule out hormonal IUDs entirely. They're a completely different phenomenon.
AskWomen X &gt; As men, it takes a large amount of trust on our part to have a baby, because we need to be sure the mother will care for it. If you have no say after conception as to whether the fetus/embryo lives or dies, it must incredibly painful to see your partner abort a potential child you are beginning to love and hope for.   For women, it takes an even larger amount of trust. They have no guarantee that the man won't just leave them during their pregnancy, leaving them to go through with it all alone, despite the fact that they both agreed on it. When do women ever abort a child they tried to conceive? Men leaving their pregnant girlfriends/wives, while not very common, does happen.
TwoXChromosomes X I just looked it up. They are affiliated. However, PPchoice receives NO state funding (no abortion providers do, as far as I know). So they are dissolving funds for Planned Parenthood in San Angelo even though this clinic provides no abortions.
TwoXChromosomes X I totally sympathize with the abortion is murder view. I can imagine how frustrating it would be to live in a country which condones murder. (I imagine it's as frustrating as it is to live in a country which condones discrimination against a group of people * ahem * marriage equality.)  But science doesn't support the idea that life begins at conception. Our government has defined, with the support of science, life as beginning at viability. When a life can sustain itself, *then* it becomes a life. (Or actually "person" is the better term here. We can argue many things are "alive.") So a fetus becomes a person when it can be removed from the womb and still survive. Until then, it isn't a person. It wouldn't survive without the mother.  And as a nation, we do restrict abortions after viability.   So if religious folks believe that personhood begins earlier then the burden of proof is on them. They must prove that, and prove it with science; not a bible quote.
beyondthebump X No downvotes from me! Congrats!  I lost all of my baby weight and then some about a week and a half post partum... but my weight sits differently now so I don't look as good (aka mommy pouch! Boo!) and I was carrying some extra weight when I got pregnant (for me- I was about 170 before pregnancy, 140 in 2005- comfy weight for me would be 140-150 ish). Just gotta get rid of the extra and tone up these muscles a bit!
Parenting X Maybe because we teach our kids actually effective methods of preventing STDs. 
TwoXChromosomes X I see a lot of comments about weight gain/loss, but nothing about sex drive. When I was using NuvaRing, I had virtually no libido. Never. This is not uncommon and should be something you keep an eye out for.  If you don't mind using a hormonal birth control, you could consider the Mirena, the other IUD (Paraguard, the copper IUD, is the non-hormonal one).  Anyway, seriously: if you notice that you're not feeling sexually excited very much, it's probably that little plastic ring shoved up your vagina. :)
AskWomen X Sometimes a new birth control can make periods funky for a couple months. I'm fairly sure that's your body getting used to the hormone changes.   If it continues you should probably see your doctor about it. 
BabyBumps X Welcome and congratulations! My first appointment was at 11 weeks and he didn't find a heart beat. He also didn't try for too long, just enough that he gave a blind effort because according to lmp I was like, 15 weeks and I told him my cycles were off. When he poked and prodded at my abdomen he guessed I was 6-7 weeks. But regardless, don't get too upset if you don't find it yet! He was reassuring me the entire time, and I wasn't worried, but I haven't been through what you have.
beyondthebump X I gained 45 during pregnancy, but by  two and a half pp, I'd lost it all. Now, I teeter back and forth from my prepregnancy weight and five pounds under. I'm 5'3" and 175lbs, so I could lose a bit more once I can start working out. Currently, all I'm doing is breastfeeding. 
BabyBumps X Cramping is normal in the first trimester, it often feels like your period is just about to start. The best way I've heard it's cause described was that your uterus is expanding (even though baby at this point is tiny) and that causes cramping to both the uterine muscle and the ligaments attached to your uterus in your abdomen.   You should worry if the cramps are more severe than light to moderate menstrual cramps, if you have any bleeding or spotting, or if it's accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting.   When in doubt call your doctor! And don't feel silly about calling them, this is what they are there for. 
BabyBumps X I also under the impression that the increased rate of UTI in Intact boys was largely due to pediatricians incorrectly telling parents to retract the foreskin and clean the glans. This introduces bacteria and can be painful, and the foreskin should never be retracted before it separates naturally. 
BabyBumps X Curious about why some choose midwives over OBs.  If you found an OB with whom you felt comfortable pursuing as natural a birth as possible, would there be other reasons to consider a midwife?
BabyBumps X Yep. Damn ligament pains. This happens to me when I sneeze or cough as well and it sucks!! So while I have no advise I feel your pain! 
beyondthebump X My shoe size went up a size because of widening with my first pregnancy. Hips also wider, a couple of small stretch marks, and I never lost my most of my post pregnancy weight (though I have exercised quite a bit - my metabolism slowed down quite a bit). I was 101 lbs before my first daughter was born, now I am around 165 post second pregnancy. I lost about 20 lbs, over the years since my first daughter that's all. I've seen a lot of moms work weight off, so hopefully you will be one of those lucky ones where post pregnancy weight is not an issue.   On positive note, with my first pregnancy weight gain, my boobs permanently gained 2 cup sizes as well, so that was kind of cool. Every person is different though, so your pregnancy will most likely effect you in very different ways. I did not get stretch marks the first time around, and now a I have some from this pregnancy. Also with the last one, I gained 76 lbs, and with this one I lost 30 lbs in the beginning, and gained 35 total (keeping me at only gaining 5 lbs total from this pregnancy over pre-preggo weight).  Hope that helps.
BabyBumps X Well with that choice made you've just confirmed in their minds that they are right about you and that their son is not the father.  Be prepared to have a rough road ahead of them telling this to their son every chance they get, which he may or may not tell you about. also be prepared to have your LO lacking the love and acceptance of 1 set of Grandparents. It's a shame really, it's your LO that will suffer the most out of this because it will be many many years before she's old enough to understand the reason. I hope it works out for you and your family.
TwoXChromosomes X This is how my first pap went:   - The nurse brought me into the room, and gave me a sheet to cover myself with. I kept on my shirt, but pants and underwear came off and I make a fabulous make-shift skirt out of the sheet.   - My doctor came in and showed me the [speculum]( _611422451258823130.jpg) he'd be using (the one he used was plastic, not metal like the one shown here. He explained that once it's inserted into your vagina, you'll hear a "click" (which I believe "opens" you up so that he can have a better access to your cervix).   - A female nurse came into the room and stood by my head (and gave some reassuring words/smiles because my doctor's office is rad).   - I didn't have to put my feet up in stirrups. I was told to scoot my bum down to the end of the table. I kept my ankles together, and then relaxed my knees so that they were touching the table. He covered me up with the sheet as much as he could.  - He said "you're going to feel my fingers" so that he could insert the speculum. After it was inserted, he warned me that I would hear that clicking noise. He then said that he was going to take a swab of my cervix, and that it might hurt a bit, and that I'd feel some pressure.   All in all, not nearly as bad as I expected! The only time I've had an issue getting a pap was with me tensing up (if you're tense - shocking since you're spread eagle infront of a doctor, right? - it's difficult for the doctor to get to your cervix). Deep breaths help. One time, he was having a particularly difficult time, and so I was instructed to place my hands under the small of my back, which allowed for a better angle.   Like me, you may be instructed to take everything on your lower half off. But if you really feel like keeping your skirt on will make you feel better, there's no harm in telling your nurse/doctor that this is your preference. But in all honesty, it'll all probably feel the same whether you have a skirt or a blanket.   My first pap I was au natural. Now I shave or trim.   If you get a girlie boner, who cares! I'm sure it's happened to plenty of other ladies before you (some people have a voyeuristic flare, it happens!). But it will probably feel rather clinical and a little uncomfortable, so I don't think you'd need to worry about it.   I certainly hope they won't tell you off for not using condoms. My doctor of course knew that I was on the pill, but he asked if I used condoms as well (I do) and just reiterated that condoms are the only way to prevent against STIs. If anything, that's what the topic of conversation will probably be if you disclose that you don't use condoms.   It doesn't *really* hurt - like I said earlier, it's mostly just uncomfortable because you feel pressure. It could of course be different for other ladies, but I've never been in legitimate pain.   Once you do it, you'll be so relieved! It's really not as huge a deal and so scary as you make it out to be (I've had this talk many a time with my friends before if you can tell ;). Just keep in mind that this is an essential component of your health care, and will be SO SO SOOOO beneficial in keeping you healthy and safe.   Best of luck, and so many internet hugs!!!!!!!
beyondthebump X With my pregnancy I gain 40lbs, at the end I gained A LOT of water weight I was swollen everywhere. And little over 6 weeks pp I'm down 47 lbs! Fitting in clothes I thought was going to take a bit to get back into.
AskWomen X There could be a lot of things going on here. My first suggestion is that she talk to her doctor about it. It is unlikely that there is anything wrong, but just in case it is better to be safe.   How old are you? Keep in mind that some women find it easier to orgasm as they get older, and a small percentage are unable to until they are in their 30s.   More likely - are you using clitoral stimulation? Have you done oral sex with her? A lot of women cannot orgasm without clitoral stimulation. So just intercourse won't work. It sounds like she is getting the build up of an orgasm but then jumping straight to sensitivity. She needs to learn how to orgasm and that will either have to be through masturbation or oral sex. 
BabyBumps X aw yeah. my hubby has four siblings who are all born last week of January/first week of February. they are all hoping for an early birth and taking bets on us!
TwoXChromosomes X If the ammendment they propose had an exception for the life of the mother, I could respect that position. I understand the way that if a fetus is alive, abortion must be murder, but in real murder, self-defense is a valid defense and makes it not murder, so why wouldn't we treat defending the mother's life the same way? In any case, I can understand why my position would be labeled as pro-murder in their eyes and I'm willing to debate that side with them, since it's the only place that we really disagree and it's the only position at which changing minds will actually matter.
TwoXChromosomes X So you're pro-choice, because you don't want to make abortion illegal for others. That's what pro-choice means. Just because you don't like abortions doesn't mean you're not still pro-choice.  People who are pro-life because they think an embryo is a baby, and that abortion is always murdering a baby, are not logically consistent if they think rape means murdering a baby is okay. Being pro-life means you want abortion to be illegal for everyone because it's murder.
TwoXChromosomes X Carrying a baby to term to give up for adoption is a valid and noble choice, and I applaud girls and women that do it. However, it is a choice, and no one should be forced to make it. No one should ever be forced to carry a child that they don't want. Carrying a pregnancy to term is an incredibly taxing thing to go through, on a woman's body and emotionally.  I am 25 and mostly stable, but am no where near ready to have a baby. I have an IUD and have taken a lot of precautions to not get pregnant, but I know that if I did, I would get an abortion. However, I know how difficult and emotional and terrible that would be to go through. But going through a whole pregnancy, giving birth to my child, and then giving it up   to someone else would be so much worse.   A pregnant woman is still one person, not just a vessel for a the zygote or or embryo or fetus that does not have consciousness.  
TwoXChromosomes X That 99% statistic covers both cases. If no egg cell is released, you can't get pregnant at all. The reason you're still unlikely to get pregnant even if you ovulate on the pill is due to the thick cervical mucus, thin and slippery uterine lining, and constricted fallopian tubes (which slows down both the sperm cells and the movement of the egg/fertilized egg through the tubes to the uterus). You're very safe, either way.
TwoXChromosomes X What stops me cold is 'not even to save the mother's life'. I can imagine justification for everything else-- I don't agree with it, but I can imagine it-- but what possible moral justification can be given for making a woman carry a child until she's dead?
TwoXChromosomes X You do realize how comparatively exceptional your case is, right? The most technical response for "why" was because you had sex (admittedly while on birth control) and your partner impregnated you. You weren't raped (otherwise you'd be excluded) and you knew full well this was a possible outcome. If you think it is best to skirt the laugh, risk death to avoid pregnancy, and possibly bleed out you are right, I can't stop that. I think it is a terrible decision, but that is definitely yours to make and I doubt you need criticism from me.   &gt;I think there's only one most effective way that doesn't violate anyone's rights, which includes but is not limited to cheaper birth control, comprehensive sex ed, and increased ease of access to reproductive health care for men and women.   I agree with everything here. The burden is still on the individual to secure their cheap birth control using their new found knowledge.   &gt;You said in another comment that you would prevent back alley abortions, but you really can't.  I would try. 
BabyBumps X YAY!!!!!!  I was worried they were going to tell me I wasn't pregnant either...funny to think that it's normal, and no one ever talks about it!  The heartbeat is seriously the most amazing thing so far.  Congrats...and yay for April babies!!!!
BabyBumps X We were trying for one month. I wasn't charting or using OPKs. I just kept track of my cycle and had sex every other day starting on the 9th day of my cycle. I must be fertile. 
BabyBumps X I had my first appointment yesterday and was so excited to see that little blob on the ultrasound!  My EDD is April 19th!  
TwoXChromosomes X I personally think abortion on demand should be legal. Any mens rea in regard to creating the baby should have no bearing on anything.   I can understand wanting to protect babies. I can logically understand banning all abortions. That makes sense to me. The baby is an innocent. He must be protected. I do not like the double think people employ carving out exceptions. Either the baby is worth protecting or not. There can be no exception if we say babies are worth saving.   As I said, making an exception for rape just carves out a loophole that the million or so women who get abortions a year will use. There is demand for almost a million abortions a year, passing a law will not stop this demand. Women will still find a way to end their pregnacy. Women have been doing it for all of recorded history and probably into pre-history. A law will not end abortions. By carving out a legal way to get abortions for rape, there will simply be a millions "rape babies" being aborted. 
TwoXChromosomes X You hit the nail right on the head. And most people who experience bad side effects try a new type of pill and they get better. Birth control is really a weird beast. 
TwoXChromosomes X Just like agreeing to go swimming is not agreeing to drown, agreeing to have sex is not agreeing to pregnancy. The point is that the foetus is still a person- and in a pro-lifer's eyes- abortion is still murder regardless of the cause of the pregnancy. If they believe the foetus is a person, the abortion is still a sin and is still murder, whether or not it is the result of a rape or of incest. Therefore, the argument contradicts. 
BabyBumps X I know what you're talking about.  It happens to me mostly while sleeping though.  I absolutely hate changing positions in the middle of the night because my vagina usually has shooting pain when I try to roll over.  Ouch!
BabyBumps X Just as a warning, nipple shields can interfere with supply and they are very hard to wean the baby off of. It took about four months before my daughter would nurse without one, and my supply did tank quite a bit despite my best efforts. If you need it, definitely use it, but I'm not sure they're ideal for long term. 
BabyBumps X I have HG, and some days it's completely awful. Not gonna lie, it's absolutely hell, but it was worse in the first and early second trimesters. Once I hit about 17 weeks it started to ease up. I was on reglan and zofran from about 8 weeks to 17 weeks. I felt like I was going to die, and i went to the hospital several times to get fluids.   From weeks 17 until now I still get sick almost every morning. It's almost become a ritual at this point and I will probably miss it after the baby arrives. I cut out a lot of sweets, drank water with lemon juice, and for some reason gatoraid really helped in the very beginning.   I know it sucks, but eventually it will lighten up. It may not go away completely, but it does get better... if only a little.  I hope I was of some help to you. 
TwoXChromosomes X Okay, so plan B: it prevents the egg from dropping and/or fertilization of the egg. It should be legal, then, right?  Why do you believe that HUMAN life begins at conception? Clearly life begins, because cells are alive, and therefore a fertilized egg is alive. Why is a grouping of cells with no brain, heartbeat, or central nervous system a human? Do you believe in an eternal soul?
BabyBumps X I've also been having cramps too, and am wondering the same thing.  Not dialated as of Friday, and baby was at a -3.  No bloody show or yet either. The cramps have been getting more uncomfortable, but nothing I can time.  Here's to hoping that it means labor is close!!
TwoXChromosomes X One of the good things about working with a specialist is that they knew what to look for- insulin, thyroid, standard reproductive hormones, androgens, and a whole lot else- and they knew at what point in my cycle was the best time to draw blood and get answers that made sense.  They were impressively better informed about what to look for and what to do than any ob/gyn I've ever been to was.
TwoXChromosomes X "Potentially deadly effects"? Reality is people die, and while I don't want them to you are saying people would choose to risk death over carry a baby to term. Once again, and finally, that is their call. 
BabyBumps X I really regret using the shield as well. They stuck one on me in the hospital and I had no clue what it was. I don't even know why it was given to me, since they said her latch was great. Came home, did research and decided we needed off of it ASAP.   Trying to wean daughter #1 from it was horrible; we tried an SNS (ugh), we tried cold turkey, everything. It was a mess. The only way she'd nurse on the breast was with that darn shield, and then she'd get angry because my supply was so low.    Eventually she just latched on by herself randomly at around 4 mos old and didn't look back. Once we got rid of the shield, I was a bit sore for a week and then everything was so much easier.  
BabyBumps X I had hg for the first three months... Vomiting non stop, lost almost 20 pounds, so so dehydrated. I went to the ER several times for dehydration and pain. The doctor put me on a home IV and a subcutaneous zofran site. I had to have the IV changed every three days for two months, and the zofran pump was up to a really high number just to keep me queasy! I thought it would never end, so many appointments and worries, plus I felt so helpless. I could hardly walk or move those first few months, had to quit my job and was on extreme bed rest. Even the couch was just too far and too difficult! The ultrasounds were the silver lining for me. Every time I saw that little bean I knew it was worth it. Now I'm 25 weeks and I only have mild morning sickness, and I feel human again. I'm even up from 101 lbs. to 136! I do wake up some days knowing it's not going to be a good day, so I try to take it easy. I've figured out rituals that help, like nibbling on anything every three hours max. So I don't get too hungry, since that can trigger severe nausea. I use a cold compress on my head and neck when I feel faint or dizzy. You definitely aren't alone , and you can get through this. Ask your doctor about options for home health if it's available to you, it really helped me! I hope you feel better soon.
TwoXChromosomes X Who's dishonest? His view demonstrates that  to him the "life" of a fetus (which isn't a person) outweighs the bodily autonomy of an actual person. Whether or not his viewpoint is consistent (it is, for whatever that's worth), I don't get how you can support it as pro-woman.
BabyBumps X UTIs are only reduced by 0.5%, the vast majority of man have no retract ability issues or hypersensitivity. Circumcision is not a substitute for condom use to prevent STDs and hygiene is easy automatic as part of a shower routine. As far as old age is concerned if you're so debilitated as to not be able to clean the penis you have much bigger hygiene problems with other body functions.   If you chose to get circumcised as an adult you must have a problem with your foreskin, a healthy, functional one is amazing for masturbation and sexual function. You are giving up a lifetime of that when you circumcise a baby. 
TwoXChromosomes X I agree that you should be able to do something about being pregnant, it is your body and trying to enforce an abortion ban would be immensely difficult and detrimental to both women and society.  But these people likely don't see being pregnant in the same way you probably do.  Pregnancy to these people isn't like some sort of illness that you can cure.  To them accepting the risk of pregnancy is equivalent to accepting parenthood.  So by consenting to sex you are consenting to parenthood should you get pregnant.
TwoXChromosomes X I had the implant for 3 years &amp; am now thinking of an IUD, the reason being that despite being on the pill for 10 years with no problems, something about having the constant hormones from the implant messed up my sex drive LOADS. So much so that when I had it out &amp; realised what the cause was I felt like I was 16 again (&amp; my SO was very pleased!)  Having an IUD would be a LOT better for me because although they do have hormones nowadays, it's no where near as much &amp; for women like me that can make all the difference!
BabyBumps X I read that spotting after having sex is normal.  It's usually caused by small blood vessels near the cervix rupturing during the act and isn't cause for alarm.  However, if you start having spotting/bleeding AND cramping, then you need to call your doctor right away.  Common sense, obviously.  To be honest, I've had symptoms, but wasn't able to connect the dots until *after* I got the positive test results (this is my first).  I think it's pretty normal for some women to not have symptoms until up to 8-10 weeks of pregnancy.  And some lucky sonofaguns don't have many symptoms, if any, their whole first trimester!!  Don't worry.  You're "normal." :P  Take care.
BabyBumps X haha you will! i'm the same height and around 235 at the beginning. I was told to try not to gain more than 15-20 pounds, but I've already gained that :/  I'll be 30 weeks this saturday.   I haven't had any issues (knock wood) and haven't been told anything about my weight except the first visit. I just felt "fluffier" until around 22/23 weeks, then it popped out overnight - you may not look pregnant as early as slimmer women, but you will! :P  [Here I am two weeks ago]( )
BabyBumps X Sadly, no. :( Walking only seems to help up to a certain point; on days when I work double shifts at work, I'm in agony because walking aggravates the pain after so many hours.  I find that laying on my side with my legs curled up as opposed to on my back helps, but I'm not sure why.
Parenting X Its not that easy to start up breast feeding after formula feeding. I actually had to quit breastfeeding cause I wasn't producing enough milk.
beyondthebump X Still walking, but haven't gotten around anything else. I am down 5 lbs and still have 10 to go for pre baby weight. Diet is big issue right now. I need to eat better. 
BabyBumps X Try taking a bath or lying on your left side. Often it can take quite a bit of rest. Could help! Heat helps my cramps. A hot water bottle or a heating pad nearby?
TwoXChromosomes X Get checked by a doctor to see if you are anemic. Or have problems with your thyroid, I have the same problems and it is because I lack iron because my diet sucks. It could be your Thyroid as well, my mother had a problem with being cold because of this but has since been medicated and is fine!
BabyBumps X I'm so jealous! I'm at 17 weeks and nothing. No bump at ALL. Stuff's been feeling firm for a couple weeks and my pants are starting to feel a bit tighter than normal, but nothing. My mum keeps calling me, "So can you tell yet?". Big fat "nope".
BabyBumps X She's beautiful!!  I hope my induction story turns out just like yours!!  They are doing gel today to ripen my cervix and starting pitocin in the morning. your daughter is gorgeous!!  :))))
TwoXChromosomes X I've had a abnormal pap smear the very first time I went to a gyno.  I was terrified.  When I went to follow-up checkup 6 months later it was perfectly normal. I was told this is quite normal and often these things fix themselves.  That was almost a decade ago and I never had an abnormal result since.
beyondthebump X Will you not be able to pump even a little when you go back to work? Are you going to continue to nurse him at home? Did you try cold milk as someone else suggested? I'm so sorry about the frozen milk! That is so incredibly frustrating, I'm sure.  If you can't pump at work, can you continue to nurse and pump at home (on weekends and evenings/mornings)? It sounds like you have a great supply. Milk can be stored in the fridge for 8 days (low shelf, in the back so it stays as cold as possible), so if you could get a fridge supply going, it's not as great as a freezer stash, but may get you around the lipase issue.  Also, if you cannot pump at all during the day at work, you need to start weaning yourself from daytime nursing/pumping now and slowly. Otherwise you will become very engorged with no way to relieve yourself and could be vulnerable to plugged ducts and mastitis. It is entirely possible to go 8-10 hours during the day without pumping and have a great supply at home. You just have to train your body to do it. In fact some babies will reverse cycle automatically when moms return to work and essentially not eat during the day and nurse every 2 hours when you are home. I'm not necessarily hoping this happens for you because you need sleep, but just putting it out there as an example that it can be done.  And if you have to supplement with formula, then so be it. Maybe try mixing as someone else suggested so your 400oz doesn't go to waste. He'll at least be getting some BM which is better than none.  Edit: I wanted to add that on weekends, it's fine to nurse during the day. Your body will eventually get used to what you need. Trust me, I pumped 3 days a week for 1.5 years with my daughter and was able to nurse on demand 4 days a week and pump every 3 hours at work (gone for 12 hours/day) with no problems. I double pumped at work and my daughter typically only ate one side per feeding since I had so much milk so the demand wasn't the same on weekends and work days.
TwoXChromosomes X I support pro choice until the child is old enough to survive outside of the womb. That's generally around 20-22 weeks. I also support medical decisions for abortion where either the life of the mother or the life of the baby would be in serious jeopardy (sickness, defects, poison, suicide issues) even up until the end of the pregnancy.
TwoXChromosomes X Because by their same logic (all abortion no matter what is murder) then Romney's exceptions for abortion (rape, incest, life in danger) are still choosing murder.  By their logic they also think Romney is choosing murder, but they respect it.
TwoXChromosomes X I believe this is why they are not doing pap smears until age 21 now. They were doing unnecessary colposcopies and over-treating when many of the abnormalities resolved on their own. 
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;Oh, it's rather easy to be "Pro-life" when an unexpected pregnancy isn't weighing heavily on your heart and mind.   "The only moral abortion is my abortion", and all that.   
TwoXChromosomes X Depo shot for 6-7 years - gave me and my sister who was on it too: osteopenia.  Pretty close to osteoporosis.  My bones still aren't quite normal after 5 years of heavy duty calcium pills.  Pill - Too many years to count.  I'm 30 now.  I did pills before and after the whole shot fiasco.  Started birth control when I was 16.  My doctor said that it doesn't matter if you have a period, if you don't have one, if it's really light, if it's a little spotty.  The only time to worry is when it's REALLY heavy or not stopping after 5-7 days.  I've only stopped once for about 6 months and I was a hormonal nightmare.
AskWomen X Are you using applicator tampons? It waaay harder to push the regular kind in with you finger.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt; Pro-life means to be against anyone having an abortion, ever, for any reason.   If we're going to assign an extremist position to "pro-life," we must do the same to pro-choice.  Henceforth:  * Pro-life - all abortions illegal, even if a woman's life is in danger  * Pro-choice - all abortions legal, even if the woman is 40 weeks pregnant and everyone involved is totally healthy  And if you're in the majority of the population who doesn't support either of those views, you'll just have to avoid labels.  Which may not be a bad thing.
BabyBumps X You are only a couple days ahead of me! I'm trying to keep track of people due close to me...so far, no due date twin. :( (March 25th, but I'm telling everyone April1st, cause I'm always late).
TwoXChromosomes X I'm not being nonchalant about abortion.  Pro-choice is not pro-abortion.  Abortions are usually a last resort because birth control can fail. 
BabyBumps X I envy you that lack of morning sickness!  My mom never got it either- she said the worst part of her pregnancies was that she got sick of her maternity clothes.   
TwoXChromosomes X So, if the fetus is shown be to killing or will kill the mother, the mother be damned because it's her fault for getting pregnant - because the life of a fetus is more important? When, exactly, is abortion considered okay and why is it okay compared to any other situtation, and when does the health and welfare of the mother actually matter over the fetus?
TwoXChromosomes X That opinion is viable... However, getting a third trimester abortion is pretty much impossible unless you have a serious, unrelated medical issue that could be or is being complicated by the pregnancy or if the pregnancy itself is in some way life-threatening.  It's difficult even to get an abortion in the second trimester without a bona fide medical reason for it. Elective abortions, in general, get carried out in the first trimester only.
BabyBumps X Thank you! I'm so happy that I had a successful VBAC. I would have nightmares during my pregnancy of having to have a c-section again-- even though to be honest IMHO my c-section was easier in every way, including recovery, but I would still have a VBAC again next time.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;I honestly don't know what they'd say in the case of a life-threatening pregnancy, so I guess I can't comment on that.  I think in life threatening cases most pro-lifers are comfortable with performing a life saving procedure on the mother even if that procedure indirectly results in the death of the fetus. At least that is what I learned in Catholic school. Even if you know the operation would result in the fetus's death, if the intent is to save the mother then they do not view it as a murder. They wouldn't call it abortion though. The intent is not to kill the child; it is to keep the mother alive.
TwoXChromosomes X I think they are a little less work than tampons. I always changed tampons way more often than I have to empty my cup. 
TwoXChromosomes X   How effective?: 99.4% effective, or less then 1 women in a hundred will become pregnant each year.   Risks: A very small risk of perforation of the uterus, if you have metal allergies to copper (or nickel since some IUDs have nickel cores), or infection. Generally there is a follow up visit to ensure it is placed properly.   Side effects: Heavy bleeding, heavier cramps on your period (this gets better after the first several months)   I encourage you to check out these resource #side_effects_tab -topics/birth-control/birth-control-effectiveness-chart-22710.htm  
TwoXChromosomes X You can use cups and IUDs together, just be extra careful and read up on it :) Make sure to break the suction before you pull and don't accidentally grab a string
BabyBumps X I'm due October 1st, so if he shows up even a little early, I'm in.  We're rooting for a couple of dates at the end - there's several family birthdays in the end of September, and it seems that everyone would be honored to share :)
TwoXChromosomes X I have heard of them, but I have no interest in trying them out.  I've been using tampons since I was 13 when my sister wanted to go swimming and I told her I couldn't wear a pad to the pool, and I'm still alive.  Saying they are "safer" than tampons seems silly to me because tampons are not dangerous.  So I have no need for a reusable (ick!) product that seems unhygienic to me since I worry more about bacteria than I do about TSS (which is a nonissue so long as you are using them correctly, which I do).
TwoXChromosomes X I clarified my point above. I think your slightly misleading, as many Pro-Lifers (such as Mitt Romney) support abortion in the cases of medical need, rape or incest. Furthermore, Pro-Choice support limitations on abortions (such as no 3rd trimester abortions).   Ontop of that, Your completely wrong, 90% of women don't support women. Most polls see Obama in the lead by something like 8 points. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yeah if you have a heavy period you have to change tampons every hour or two, even if you use the super extra kind. The Diva Cup (which is what I had) holds an ounce of fluid, which is substantially more than a tampon. I have a decently heavy period and after the first day I could leave my Diva in for 10+ hours and not have to empty it.
BabyBumps X One of my boys has EIF (Echogenic intracardiac focus), which is similar in that in may be a sign of chromosome abnormality, but it is also seen in healthy pregnancies. Like CPCs, EIFs can sometimes disappear on their own as the pregnancy progresses. I'm a very frank person, so I asked my doctor a ton of question and asked for honest, medical answers. She basically said that these things are probably more common than the statistics show and, since I'm thin and have had lots of ultrasounds, it's more likely that I'll have something 'odd' detected on mine than the average pregnant women. Like you, my quad screen didn't reveal anything, so I'm not worried about it at all.   Take it as a sign that you have really, really good ultrasound techs who notice things that others might not. 
BabyBumps X I take OTC...I just got the Target brand. It has plenty of folic acid. (IDK which country you are in, but in the US, they all have folic acid in them, so I'm not too sure why your doc would tell you to supplement them).  Also, I've been told the gummy ones don't have iron in them, but I don't know.
BabyBumps X I take the NatureMade brand softgels that I get from CostCo. They have added DHA, so that's good. The only downside I have is that there is fish oil in them, so as long as I swallow it down before inhaling the scent of fish, I don't gag. These ones don't make me burp.   I used to take a one-a-day women's multi-vitamin that made me nauseated. I switched to the Pre-natal softgels (before getting pregnant) and I guess my stomach likes the way those digest better.
BabyBumps X I'm in the US. Doc told me that they should have at least 1mg of folic acid. Maybe that was just during the first trimester?
TwoXChromosomes X Check out [IUD Divas]( -divas.livejournal.com/).  If you have more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them.  I am 26, in a long term relationship, no kids.  I got mine last year.  I have not tried the Mirena because I've had bad experiences with hormones, but after kids I may try it.  My Paraguard has made periods a painful, bloody experience (which they were never before).  I love having an IUD for peace of mind, but I think in retrospect I might have chosen the Mirena and risked the hormones (it is, after all, a much lower hormone dose than the pill or even the Nuvaring, both of which have given me bad reactions).
TwoXChromosomes X I was pro-choice before I got pregnant at 19 but being pregnant and choosing to carry to term only reinforced my belief that the decision should be mine and no one else's. I was heavily pressured by many, many people to have an abortion, and if not that, then to consider adoption. That's when I realized that the opinion of others should not matter. What mattered is what I wanted to do and I chose to have and keep my son. I've lived with those consequences without regret. I'll also defend any woman's decision, regardless of what she decides to do. 
AskWomen X Well seeing as I can always go a full hour and she enjoys it all why should I not focus on the sex? I have never understood how people don't focus on their gf during sex. She usually gets warmed up in the five minutes, then we play around for awhile and I generally get her off at least once in round 2. 
TwoXChromosomes X How many states require employers to provide maternity leave?
BabyBumps X I waited til 14 weeks since I was at a high risk of 1st trimester miscarriage due to my advanced maternal age of 43. 
TwoXChromosomes X The problem here is that even if we take the position that the fetus is actually a "human being" equal to any other human being, forcing women to use their organs and body to support them for months without their explicit permission would give them a special right that **no other human being has**.   Don't believe me? OK, let's look at organ donation. Can I take someone's kidney without their permission to save my life - even though they have two and can almost certainly survive with one? No, I can't. That would be a grotesque invasion of their right to personal autonomy. In fact, I can't even take the organs of a *dead* person to save my life without the permission of them and their family, even though they aren't using it and it's just going to rot in the ground.   So what suddenly changes with pregnancy? Is it the fact that it's the "mother's responsibility" to give up her rights for the child? I don't think so, unless you are prepared to argue that any mother should be forced to give up her organs if her child gets sick and needs a liver or a kidney, even if she doesn't want to.   So *even if* you take the position that a fetus is in fact a human being with a right to life, which I'm not entirely sure I agree with, *even then* there is still no precedent in our culture to force someone to allowed their organs to be used by someone else without their explicit permission. Especially when such use has potentially life-threatening consequences.
TwoXChromosomes X I understand what you mean completely. I am 35 weeks pregnant also (congrats!) and I've always been very much against abortion (still pro-choice, cause it's not my body/life) but I hated the idea of abortion. Then once I got pregnant and realized how insane it actually is, I started to have a different understanding of people who get abortions. I knew right away I wanted to keep him because I'm 25 and even though I'm not in the "right place" to have kids, I think I'm ready and I love my boyfriend very much, so I wanted my baby, but I also now understand how hard it is to realize you're *actually* pregnant. It's easy to feel disconnected from the little baby growing inside you, until you can feel it moving around (for me it was about 19 weeks).
beyondthebump X I am pumping and they give what I pump to him before the formula. I just started getting a little over 3 ml so I will keep going. He has a feeding tube so he can't really nurse yet...especially since he is still learning the sucking,swallowing, breathing- once he gets it down I will nurse every time! Thanks for the advice! 
BabyBumps X My OB is competent and very good at what she does, however she's not personable.  She's been my GYN for years though, so I trust her.  But eventually I'm finding a new OB/GYN (mostly due to insurance), and next pregnancy I may even use a midwife. The staff at the hospital I'm delivering at is *amazing*.  I've been there three times already this pregnancy (once was just to get my second round of the steroid shot) and I couldn't have been happier with how I've been treated each visit.  Absolutely no complaints there.
BabyBumps X Ohhh I'm so jealous :) I've been feeling small movements a couple of times a day now but they're still just little twinges. My husband gets almost upset sometimes when I tell him I felt movement, because he can't feel it yet! Just a few more weeks... 
TwoXChromosomes X only about 50% of the workforce qualifies for FMLA. A company must be larger than 50 people, and you must work there full time, and have been there longer than a year. 
beyondthebump X lol I know it can last 6 weeks, or if your my mom it can last months, but I'm not sure if the popping is quite so normal and it seems to me that the popping causes the continued bleeding.  Mostly I just hate my pelvis popping, it hurts and is uncomfortable :/
BabyBumps X Crazy huh? I woke up at 0230 in labor and had my daughter at 0630. The day before had been some braxton hicks as normal but nothing really. 4 hours and tada?! It was nuts! Worried my little boy is going to fall out beforr I get to the hospital. 
TwoXChromosomes X I just skipped three months and should be getting mine this week sometime. Before i did this i could get halfway through the placebos before starting my period. after skipping a bit, it takes maybe 2 regular pills into the new pack to start? im waiting for it now, and i know it's coming because im in full pms bitchmode like i normally get lol 
AskWomen X They likely have genital herpes and HPV.  HPV can be deadly to women, so no they aren't clean. 
AskWomen X It's intimate and touching is nice. Also sex feels good even if you don't orgasm. I've never orgasmed with another person before and I still enjoy sex.
TwoXChromosomes X And that's why it should be a choice, since "life" is pretty subjective until the fetus is viable, when there is no grey area.  I consider a life a "life" when it is completely viable and functional.  Simply being "alive" has never helped anyone or anything.
TwoXChromosomes X I think it's fair that both parents should be able to walk away from supporting their child in every way possible at any time possible.  If I thought otherwise I would have to be against adoption imo.  It would, however, be less of an issue if we had a badass support structure in place.  Ideally it would be best for the man, or woman, to walk away during pregnancy before it is decided the fetus is given personhood, with its associated benefits and protections.  I mean, if it's acceptable for the fetus to be aborted (killing it) during this time I don't see why it's unacceptable for either parent to withdraw other forms of support as well.  Your distinction between what is and is not a human is completely subjective.  To you it is only human once it passes a certain point in development.  You ignore the fact that a fetus is still human, it is just at the specific point in its development that it is referred to as a fetus.  It doesn't suddenly go from nonhuman to human just because it leaves the womb.  It does, however, gain legal personhood at birth... but that is pretty much just for convenience sake.  It's similar to the transition between children and adults.  They don't suddenly go from nonhuman to human, they just get more rights because we say they do.  Like I said, you are just dehumanizing the fetus so it makes it easier for you to rationalize abortion (killing it).
BabyBumps X Hehe this made me giggle. My SO is terrified of us getting pregnant, I'm sensitive normally he can't imagine how sensitively I'll take everything under pregnancy hormones. I guess I'll just have to take each day as it is, watch my tongue, and try and have fun with it :D 
TwoXChromosomes X I used to be religious about checking for the strings every month.  Then one month I couldn't find them and I freaked.  Thankfully my boyfriend is awesome, checked, and assured me they still were there. The strings have wrapped themselves up around my cervix so I can't easily feel them which is much better than when I first got it and they would poke me occasionally.
BabyBumps X FFN - It is only certain about a 'negative' if you count having "contractions" as labor.  For people who have PROM (premature rupture of membranes) the test can't detect that and often when your water breaks labor immediately begins.  That is the way I always go into labor.... my water breaks.  Which is why I feel like that test (at least for me) is so useless.  With this baby, my doc didn't even bother doing them toward the end... it was a waste of money. 
BabyBumps X OMG I started having gallbladder issues while pregnant.. PLUS a cyst surrounding my left ovary the size of a volleyball...  Had the cyst removed 3 months after I gave birth...  Gall bladder flared up, sent me to the hospital 2 years later...  2 days with no food and morphine every 2 hours, they finally removed it laproscopically...  Worst pain ever!!  I had natural child birth...  Id rather have natural child birth everyday for a year than to have my gallbladder flare up!!
TwoXChromosomes X Please correct me if I'm wrong but, don't by those same standards means that you can't force one person to use their body to sustain another person's life? I was told that it would be the same legal battle as someone who is perfectly healthy being forced to be hooked up to a sick person while the sick person uses the healthy person's liver or other organ to stay alive. Legally, you can't force someone to be a human dialysis and you can't force a woman to be a human incubator for a fetus. Can someone clarify or correct this theory?
BabyBumps X Congratulations on your beautiful baby. Sorry you had to go through that. Just do your best to not let it bring you down. No matter how much we plan the birthing experience it rarely ends up like we want, Ambien or no Ambien. I also have a bunch of strong feelings about Ambien due to a similar experience.  With my first, they gave me Ambien and pain medicine. It made me sleep and really wacky. I would fall asleep between contractions. My contractions would interrupt and become part of my dreams. By the time I woke up it was full blown contraction that I couldn't prepare for. The nurses told me to stop screaming and breathe, I told them it was their fault for forcing that stuff on me (told me they would send me home if didn't take it.). Went from 0 to fully dialated within 45 mins, he came out with one push. The doctor arrived a few minutes after he was out, the epideral came 20 mins later.  
TwoXChromosomes X Humans are animals all the time...  I guess I just disagree with your language then.  It is human life, it just lacks the necessary development to assign personhood to it.  Personhood being what you are calling "life" I think.  There are many pro-choice people who do actually believe that an embryo is not alive.  I personally think this is a poor justification for being pro-choice.
AskWomen X Except for, from what I understand, HPV is generally not painful and a lot of the strains that cause symptoms there's a vaccine for these days (not perfect, I know!).  So, HPV is WAY less shitty than cold sores.
BabyBumps X I have discharge that can be watery. Can have a yellowish milky tint. I'm 36 weeks, I do wear panty liners and they absorb it, if I didn't  it would probably run down my legs but it's normal. 
TwoXChromosomes X Did you get morning sickness, and if so, how long did it last and how severe was it? By severity, I mean like did you throw up a teeny bit in the morning then feel fine, or did you throw up and feel miserable all morning and afternoon?
AskWomen X True, but if you already have HPV, before being vaccinated, as a woman, there's an increased chance of cervical cancer, depending on what strain you have. And, as a guy, you don't want to be the  one responsible for giving a woman the cancer-causing strain.  Therein lies the rub. Arguably, cancer is worse than a noticeable blister.
BabyBumps X I use the Babycenter app as well. It updates with a little icon in the corner each new week. Like NeverLucid said, it has updates on "what's the baby doing/developing this week" and "what to expect from your body." Sometimes it has funny pregnancy related comics or stories. I recommend it.
TwoXChromosomes X If you get an epidural you are not allowed to get out of bed to do anything, including using the bathroom. I was in labor for about eight hours *after* the epidural was placed, was nowhere near dilated enough to start pushing and had a very full bladder, so they didn't even want me to bear down to urinate. Besides, I had all of my inlaws in the room with me and didn't want to wet the bed in front of them. I wanted to hang on to what little dignity I had left. I wish they would have just given me a bedpan or something. 
beyondthebump X I can see where LCs are coming from with waking baby up. I am an on-demand feeder, but keep in mind breastmilk only takes 90 minutes to digest. 
BabyBumps X I felt movement at 14 weeks and could feel kicks on the outside by 16 weeks, and had alien belly by 20 weeks.
TwoXChromosomes X I gained 50 pounds. I lost 15 pounds soon after birth. 6 months later I was still at the same weight. I just now two years later am back to my pre-pregnany weight.
BabyBumps X I guess the Ambien was helpful with not remembering how it felt to go from zero to fully dilated. I just remembered the nurses were freaked out. Was so out of it, I felt like pushing, so I pushed without asking if it was okay. Water broke, and then my body took over with getting the baby out. The nurses didn't have the table broken down and just only one glove on. Should have seen it as things to come, got a very tough and very headstrong boy. It is something can laugh at now. 
TwoXChromosomes X If you're not comfortable even getting your own fingers up there, that's totally okay - it's YOUR ladybusiness, and only you can decide what belongs in there.  :)  That said, either I have a weird-shaped vagina or stubby fingers, because thus far, I've never had to shove any fingers in there to get my cup adjusted.  Even so, it's definitely not something I'd recommend to someone else who needs to have the hang of it without any practice time.    Me, I jammed mine in for the first time in an airport, and did my first empty/reinsert while on an airplane.  I had beginner's luck, obviously, because my second cycle with my cup was like a week-long murder scene in my pants.
BabyBumps X Long story short, while I want a natural birth with minimal interventions they were too hippy for me. They recommended a homeopathic remedy and I could no longer trust their judgement. I'm more comfortable with the certified nurse midwives who have the nursing background and the new birth center has an OB on call. At the original birth center if there were any complications there was no way of knowing in advance where I would be transferred to and I would be responsible for my own transportation unless my life was in danger.
BabyBumps X Even though I'll be birthing in one of the top ranked hospitals in the U.S. *their* labor and delivery class looks like a waste of time.  I honestly wouldn't ever bother going through a hospital for that type of information and would instead suggest looking into birthing classes given by a trained doula, midwife, nurse etc.  I've heard many women say they've regretted going through the hospital's program (not just the hospital in question either) because they didn't learn much more than they already knew and when it came down to laboring and birthing their children, they didn't feel adequately prepared.  For that reason, the husband and I are taking Bradley classes.  At the tune of $400 per 12-week session, it's unfortunately out of reach for many individuals.  However, I would still definitely recommend at least looking into something outside of the hospital since hospital classes tend to be fuller and not as comprehensive.  Plus, they're not *all* as expensive as the one we plan to attend, so don't let that freak you out too much.
BabyBumps X My friend labored for right around 16 hours and ended up having a C-section.  I guess I didn't specifically ask, but she never mentioned any problems like having to let her vag recover.  In her situation, the baby wasn't able to move down and was stuck in her pelvis, so I'm not sure if it would be different if it was more of an emergency situation where baby had moved down some.
AskWomen X I have no idea why people downvoted this. It is absolutely true. Several strains of the herpes virus exist out there, such as chicken pox. Cold sores are caused by HSV1.
BabyBumps X You should be able to switch at any time, considering how busy most ob-gyns are, your current ob should not take it personally. On the downside, it may be hard to get an appointment immediately with a different practice.   I switched 3 times during this pregnancy: switched from ob practice to midwife birth center at 20 weeks, and then at 28 weeks moved, so switched to another midwife birth center, and then switched again to an ob/midwife hospital practice at 34 weeks due to complications. Did not regret it for a moment, but do get all the records when you go. It made it so much easier to have the copy of the records on hand. 
BabyBumps X Very interesting! I feel the same about a lot of these procedures and have let it be known to my doctor, as well as my two birthing coaches, that I do not want to have any type of interference with the natural birth unless absolutely necessary. 
BabyBumps X I actually felt 'flutters' from about week 14-15, but I didn't know what they were. It wasn't until I felt my first big 'pop' at 17 weeks that I was completely sure. 
TwoXChromosomes X Pregnancy 1: First month off the pill Pregnancy 2: We thought we were ready for another baby. We had unprotected sex once. We changed our minds and decided to wait and went back to using protection. Didn't matter. I had already conceived. Twins.
AskWomen X You can get HSV1 or HSV2 in both places, oral and genital. We don't know which one he has. It's likely HSV1, but either way, it's not a good idea. 
AskWomen X As for what cramps feel like: have you ever had pain so bad from diarrhea that you are doubled over?  It is a very similar sensation.
BabyBumps X That's awful! You and your baby will be fine bodies are designed to have babies naturally. I would be much more comfortable having a baby naturally than having a woman who told me my babies head would fall off give me a c-section. And we see on here measurements are wrong all the time so there's still a chance you could have a perfectly normal siZe baby. If it was me I wouldn't worry. :) /hugs
AskWomen X Many women have already answered your main questions, so I just want to add a little interesting tidbit. In terms of how you know when your period is coming, carrying products etc. I have a period tracking smart phone app. It tells me what day my next period should start and how long it will last (based on my past history), so I don't have to keep track of it myself. When I have something like breast tenderness, I check my app, and can see that in a couple days it will be my period. I think the app works best for women with a reliable cycle (like mine). Also to add: if someone is on the pill, then they know when their period should start based on what pill they are on. When you know your period should arrive soon, you can start carrying products and checking when you use the restroom.
BabyBumps X I was induced 2 weeks ago and it was 36 hours from the first drip of Pitocin to baby in my arms. All I would say is be patient, don't get the epidural until you are absolutely at your pain threshold because it does slow things down considerably and don't allow yourself to be put on a clock by the doctor until the water has broken (and even then, you have 24 hours). It may take a long time for things to progress to true labor but then is generally quick from that point. If you are taking a long time you maybe be pressured to considering a c-section but this is strictly for everyone's convenience. I am so glad that I denied when I was offered. Good luck and congrats!
BabyBumps X I know people who birthed vaginally who had trouble bonding with their babies.  What I mean to point out is that it isn't your fault if bonding takes a minute, either way.  One thing I really like about the hospital/midwife practice I'm with is the way they do c-sections.  You can make a birth plan!    A friend just did things this way with their practice, and they did their best to make it as close to what she'd imagined for her vaginal birth as possible.    Her husband got to announce the gender and cut the cord.  They did skin to skin and established breastfeeding as soon as the baby came out.  Her midwife attended the surgery and made sure she wasn't given any medications that would interfere with breastfeeding.  She had a great experience.
TwoXChromosomes X Just chiming in to give my support and some Internet hugs! I haven't been in your situation (I terminated my unplanned pregnancy) but I wanted to say that you shouldn't feel like you have to explain and justify your choice to anyone. You laid out some perfectly good reasons and no one should judge you for them. Best of luck to you! &lt;3  (And not that you asked, but I'm 100% ok emotionally almost 5 years after my abortion. It was the best thing I've ever done for myself and my future children.)
TwoXChromosomes X I gained 45 lbs. I lost 15 right away (which is normal for the baby, placenta and extra fluids). At six months I was down another 15. The last was gone at 9 months (ironic?). 
BabyBumps X You know what? I had the EXACT same shit said to me by my OBGYN with my first son. Well, I was 18 and figured the doctor knew everything and I better listen. I got my c-section done and it was completely unnecessary. Now, being pregnant with #2, 35 weeks, I found myself a **Midwife** and a **Doula**. I recommend having them, instead of a surgeon doctor to deliver your baby.
BabyBumps X Um... I had that when I am on my feet, at working, running around, and having sex.  They often got up to 3-5 times, sometimes more.  I was eventually hospitalized for preterm labor at about 24 weeks when it didn't stop for a couple of hours.    So, I Spent the next 10 weeks on bedrest.  Then at my 34 week appointment, my doc checked my cervix, said, I had no changes and I could get off bedrest - it probably wasn't necessary in the first place.  The next day I went to work and that night I delivered my first son.  34w 5d.  Fortunately he was fine.    I changed doctors.  Now, when I get any contractions that are like 2 in 15-20 minutes, I lie down.  My last two babies I carried to term.  This one is doing fine too now that I take it seriously.  Sorry about the tone of this.  I just really resented how casual my doctor was about the contractions I was experiencing.  She risked my baby and I am still a bit bitter about that.  He turned out fine, but I know I was just lucky, not well cared for.
BabyBumps X I had a similar all natural birth and while I never learned anything about hypnobabies, I was able to get through my contractions through visualizations that I have used before during exercise and other experiences where I had to push myself through pain.   Also, I was similar.. I was all clam and collected till transition. During transition, that is when I lost my sh*t but thankfully it goes by fast enough that it wasn't bad.   How was pushing for you? Did you find it as a relief? Also, did you experience the ring of fire?   Congrats and the baby and I can't wait to see pictures. 
TwoXChromosomes X Have you considered anything other than yeast infections as the cause? I kept getting them and treating them and having horrible pain with sex. It turned out that they were a symptom of a vaginal skin tearing issue I have called lichen schlerosis. Not saying that you have this, just that you might want to ask about getting tested for something other than a STD/infection.
TwoXChromosomes X Try using a hypoallergenic water-based lube. It doesn't have the (theoretically, I've only a few studies) harmful parabens and glycerins that most water and silicone based lubes have. I use Vie's ultra sensitive lube: 
BabyBumps X Yes! It is very painful, my daughter had to help me get out of bed this morning. I will definitely look into seeing a chiropractor if my doc can't do much. Being in any kind of pain is a tad frustrating. Especially when it's your girly parts. This baby also putting pressure on me down there, does not help much. I bet my pelvic bone is definitely misaligned. It feels that way! 
BabyBumps X Yup, gonna stop checking myself. Went in and my cervix is in an anterior position, but it's closed so I just have to take it easy for a bit:) I updated the post as well, thanks for well wishes!
BabyBumps X I've gained 30 pounds so far. My goal is 40-50, so I'm happy with my current progress.  Different women's bodies and babies take the weight differently. If all your tests are coming back fine, then don't worry. I had a friend who gained 50 pounds with her singleton and it turned out perfect that she had gained the weight and her baby was measuring big because her daughter didn't need any help at all despite being born at 34 weeks. Likewise, my mom gained 50 pounds with all of her healthy pregnancies. 
BabyBumps X Chiming in for the chubby ladies....I was 234 at the 8 wk appt.   by 20 weeks I was down to 212 due to hyperemesis. Now, at almost 29 weeks I'm back to 235, so I'm only really up 1 lb, which the doctor seems to be pretty comfy with.  I had some extra baggage to begin with, and the little one is still healthy as could be.
BabyBumps X In the case a breech baby doesn't turn (and they won't deliver breech), will they let labor start spontaneously before doing a c-section?  Though honestly, I think once you start asking questions, you'll get a pretty good picture of how the doctor practices pretty quickly. 
TwoXChromosomes X Do you find any other complications with having a monstrously heavy flow?  My flow is fairly light (it's very rare that I remove a regular tampon after 3-4 hours and have it completely soaked), and it usually only lasts 3-4 days. My lightest flow was only 2 days last month, but I think I was a little bit stressed so that could have affected it. Even still, I find I get terrible back pain just before I start. How about you? Any iron deficiencies due to the heavy flow or anything?
BabyBumps X It may be something simple like they predicted how far along you are based on your LMP, but the hormone levels in the blood make it seem like you're a bit further along/not quite as far along as they thought. I had to get an ultrasound done ASAP cos they said the sooner they find out the length, the better (my periods were very irregular so no other way to date it). Then another two weeks later to check viability.   So it could be totally simple but I'd call back to find out. Guessing probably won't put your mind at ease. Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes X I use the U tampons and playtex sport. I like the Us for purse tampons and the sport ones give the best leak protection, which is important to be because I don't bother with pantyliners/pad, ever (smell funny, and are uncomfortable). I've been using tampons probably since I got my period. My mom had a rather cruel way of making me learn how to use them. It was keep trying until you get it right, the instructions are on the box, I'm not buying pads. Wouldn't recommend her technique but I've been using tampons successfully since middle school.
BabyBumps X yeah! he never stops moving and kicking, and his kicks are ALL over my belly, im sure hes all different ways all the time haha
BabyBumps X Well I went into preterm labor and we never got a definitive answer as to why. My baby certainly wasn't ready though. I was 32 weeks. They told me if I went into full on labor again after 35 weeks then they wouldn't try and stop it, but that was because I had gotten the steroids and magnesium. From what they told me though, there is usually some type of infection that causes preterm labor. 
BabyBumps X nothing. nada.   I'll have about 1 week PTO saved up.  up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, and my job is protected under FMLA. Luckily I live in one of TWO states in all of the US that have state benefits, I am not sure if I get 6 weeks or 12 weeks worth though.  yeah. I'm less than thrilled, considering I was looking elsewhere when I got my positive, and stayed solely for the benefits that I'm not getting. :(
BabyBumps X &gt;Most doctors in the US induce between 37-39 weeks. It's a common practice.  I wouldn't say that most doctors induce that early. The latest statistics are that 2/3 of women have labor induced in some way (stripping membranes, AROM, pitocin), but most women aren't induced until at least 39 weeks. 37 is actually really early. 
BabyBumps X I didn't really feel pregnant until I felt baby kicks at 19 weeks. Now I feel uber pregnant since I can't see my lady parts and putting pants/shoes on is a serious struggle every day. 
BabyBumps X Same situation here. We're going to be staggering shifts because we can't afford to live on his wages alone (we're, *combined*, at a whopping 40% of our area's average family income.) My SO will be able to use up a few vacation days or sick days to be there for the few days following birth, but then he'll have to go right back to work. He'll get paid, since he's FT, but I won't get a dime.  Honestly, I'm likely going to be working the same as you: work until 2 weeks pre-DD, take 6 off post-birth.
TwoXChromosomes X Yup.  And it does not matter if you were responsible for the fetus or not.  If your own child - out of the womb and grown - needed a bone marrow transplant to save his life, you could not be compelled by law to donate bone marrow to save your child's life.  The boundaries of the body are sacred, and the State should not be violating them.  
TwoXChromosomes X As a mother of a two year old and expecting a daughter any day now, what she had growing was not a baby. It was a fetus. I really really really wish people would quit calling fetuses "babies" because they're not. In the USA (where I live) a fetus is not considered a baby or person with rights until it is fully extracted from the mother's body.     Now, i personally believe that if a woman chooses to do everything in her power to carry a fetus and birth it, by all means, she should refer to it as her baby even if it's just a baby-to-be. This woman did NOT want to birth her fetus to personhood and therefore I feel it is unjust to refer to her 5 month fetus as a baby. My concern for her getting a late-term abortion is that I think it's a lot more risky for her than an earlier-term one health-wise. But, she doesn't seem to care much about that right now, anyway.   I just wish the best on the babies that are now children she did want and will now have to live without their mother because a terrible man put her in a very bad spot for being in her culture.
BabyBumps X I can take off twelve weeks total. I'll get short term disability at 60% of my base rate (which will be a serious pay cut, since I'm used to getting night shift differential and weekend option bonus pay) for four weeks for a vaginal delivery or six weeks for a c-section. After my short term disability I can use whatever PTO I have accrued (I think I'll have about six weeks saved up by then). I'll probably end up having to take two weeks unpaid, but we're short right now so I'm getting a ton of overtime and just saving up the extra money in a baby account.
BabyBumps X I've saved up 3 weeks of PTO and my company will let me take off as long as I need. They haven't offered to pay for any additional time off though so I'll be back asap and my husband will start working part-time to stay home with the baby.
TwoXChromosomes X It does make a difference for what sort of pill you're taking.  Mine is 21 yellow pills, 7 red pills.  The red ones are all sugar pills that do nothing.  The yellow ones are all the same dose, so the hormonal level stays the same all the way through the month.
BabyBumps X I did maternity cover for a woman who 'found out' at 8 months. Everyone else knew, on account of her waddle and huge belly. I'm going with 'denial'.
AskWomen X While the showering etc will do nothing to prevent pregnancy, taking your birth control every day almost always will, which you have been doing.      Have you had any other pregnancy symptoms? Nausea? Tender breasts? I mean, you said you had irregular periods and now you're having irregular periods which are more worrying than usual.... why?      Look. Go to a doctor. Get a blood pregnancy test. Calm the fuck down.
TwoXChromosomes X I do the exact same thing. My doctor recommended that I have my period every 3 months or so, but said that I only need to have it about once a year. I've got as long as 6 months without having it.  I experience very little side effects, other than your average birth control side effects. When I first start, I had some spotting. If I miss a pill or take it late I seem to get cramps earlier than friends who have their period monthly (that being said, I have _fierce_ cramps, which is why I only have my period every couple months, so that may have something to do with it).  My boyfriend has no complaints. ;)
BabyBumps X Omg, *amazing news* even with that little (well I'm sure it didn't feel little at the time) scare about her lip.  But all is well!!  Oh, I'm so happy for you hun!!
TwoXChromosomes X Mine change from cycle to cycle with some being worse than others. My worst one's feel just like early pregnancy. I have nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness,  can smell everything, super tired, sore breasts, cravings, and cramping. I can't begin to tell you how many times I've been excited to be pregnant or how many pregnancy tests I've wasted for nothing.
BabyBumps X I had a dream that I went into labor and went to the hospital. I think I was in my 24th week but that didn't seem to bother me. I show up to labor and delivery and it's all dark and no one is there. I get settled into my room with my husband and then I feel like I have to poop. So I go to the bathroom and after I'm finished I have my bloody show. So I go to my room and call a nurse and tell her it's time. I think I pushed once and the baby was delivered. Except it wasn't a baby it was some sort of ball with what looked like four noodles coming out of it, wrapped in a blanket. 
BabyBumps X I didn't have a preference really, I kept alternating, and when I first found out I was a little disappointed.. I think I would have felt a little disappointed with a girl too, I'm so indecisive. xD But mostly I just wanted to know. And now I do and I'm thrilled!
TwoXChromosomes X I discussed paraguard with the nurse, and I asked her of the two (mirena and pg) which she'd recommend for me. She stated mirena, simply because pg is known to increase cramps and make regular periods heavier than before. Mine are already awful enough, and even though the peace of mind (for me at least) of having a period once a month would be there, the pain is not something I'd want.  Also, as far as expulsion of iud's, she stated that unless the company that makes them is generous enough to provide another one, you'd have to pay for it again to have it replaced.
BabyBumps X I asked for an induction at my 38 week check-up Tuesday. It's scheduled for Monday morning! This is very surprising b/c my OB is known for not giving in to such requests, especially when done before the due date (I'll be 39 weeks 1 day on Monday). She even went ahead and swept my membranes at the check up. Hopefully I'll go into labor on my own before Monday's induction, but either way I'm very happy to know the end date!  Good luck with having your baby this year and not having to pay the extra deductible!
TwoXChromosomes X I suggest you go off BC for a while and see if the migraines disappear. If they do, then it was the BC and you can pursue a non-hormonal form like the Paragard, barrier methods, or spermicides. If not, you may want to pursue a different form of hormonal BC, as the migraines around your period may disappear with the appropriate form of BC.
TwoXChromosomes X &gt;The "disturbance" will give you a period that can last a full month. Each one gets shorter till its gone though and the monthly cramps (if you had them) go away.  Man, I wish this were the case for me! How long did it take for your periods to get shorter?   
BabyBumps X If it's any comfort to you, I had an induction and it ended up being way less scary than I thought. I was humming the Jaws theme when they hooked me up to the Pit and was expecting immediate wicked contractions, but kept getting what I thought were still just the braxton-hicks.    Then when it finally did start to hurt hours later, I asked for the epi, thinking I was just getting started and I'd better get it now before they got unbearable. Epi goes in, they check me and voila! I'm at a 9. Hour and a half later I am holding a wriggly little newborn girl. :) 
TwoXChromosomes X Yup, they told me that I would have more cramping from insertion and would have heavier periods/cramps from not being on hormones anymore. It wasn't like they were trying to talk me out of it (if anything they pushed the Mirana over the Paragaurd, but I didn't want hormones anymore), it was just a statement of facts.
AskWomen X &gt; For a guy, having sex with a condom is not sex.   Perhaps it's because I don't understand what sex with a condom while being circumcised is like, but I think this is a ridiculous exaggeration.  Sex with a condom is a bit less "intense" (and for me personally it's mostly because of the heat barrier), but nowhere near awful. And even if it were, (and again, perhaps this is because I'm particularly paranoid abour STDs and pregnancies), there's just no other way around it. A single night of sex, awesome as it might be is **not** worth the risk of catching something, or getting someone pregnant. Pushing for it when the person you're about to sex is clearly against it would be... just unthinkable for me.
TwoXChromosomes X You should probably refer to the info sheet for the tampons you use but when I used to use tampons (DivaCup fan now) I used tampax and they said you should keep it to 8 hours and I'd always follow this.  Now I use DivaCups and keep them in as long as I feel like it (sometimes even up to 24 hours, though the official recommendation is 12). 
BabyBumps X Yay there is hope for us anterior placenta ladies!! My husband was only just able to feel kicks today and I was wondering if I would get the alien belly experience :)
BabyBumps X Aside from weight issues, here's why I'm not ready to take a bump pic yet:  I don't have one. No bumps for me yet. And to make it worse, my stomach muscles have loosened all up (I swear, the first few weeks I felt like I had done 500 situps), so my tummy sticks out like I have a bump (ok, ok, it kinda did anyways, but it's worse now), but when I suck it in, it's obvious there is none.
AskWomen X Apparently people think condoms prevent all STDs. Not true. Any skin STD, HPV, parasites, Herpes can be transmitted. I would have thought you'd read up on this before all that casual sex.
TwoXChromosomes X I just change it every time I need to use the restroom. Sometimes during the day that'll be every four hours, and sometimes at night it'll be more like eight or ten, very rarely even twelve. I've never had any problems. TSS is extremely rare. 
AskWomen X If it's a visible oral herpes outbreak, then we can be 99% sure it's HSV-1. 
TwoXChromosomes X Yup. Abnormal PAP at like 19 or something - cervical displasia. Follow up appointment in 6 mos: abnormality gone. Follow up 1 yr later: still gone. Follow up the next year: still gone.   Then of course I was denied for health insurance for having an abnormal PAP, even though nothing resulted from it. Not anymore though, thank you President Obama!
TwoXChromosomes X Exactly. The question came up on EVERY insurance company's enrollment form: *Have you had an abnormal PAP smear in the last 2 years?* It didn't ask if anything *resulted* from the abnormal PAP, it didn't ask if you have any *diagnosis*... it only asked if you have had an abnormal PAP. [26% of women have had an abnormal PAP smear in their lifetimes.]( ) It's utterly ridiculous to have a non-condition be a pre-existing condition. Thank god for the ACA.
BabyBumps X I actually picked my midwives group because of the hospital where they deliver. Turns out the midwives are great too, so win-win so far.   I think some good questions would be how they feel about birthplans and whether or not y'all will even use one. Try and look up their c-section rates, I was able to find them through my insurance website.   Nurses can make or break a hospital stay, but you can always ask for a new nurse. That'll be your job. If you feel like your gf would be better off with another person in the room, talk to the dr and request a new nurse be assigned to your gf. 
BabyBumps X a lot of that may just be gas, i now that one of the things that made me think i might be pregnant was how much bigger all of a sudden my stomach seemed when i hadn't gained or lost any weight - i realized i was pregnant about 2 to 3 weeks after conception.. i should say i suspected pregnancy, and confirmed it a week later :D  even though i was never extra-farty, at least i don't think i was, i know my belly was expanded way before it could have been baby.  i'm just now starting to get the actual baby bump :D
TwoXChromosomes X I have cervical dysplasia. I was told (by my Gynecologist) that in 80% of cases of women under 30, the situation will go away on its own. However, you could end up needing to get your abnormal/cancerous cells taken off through a freezing procedure or a LEEP.
TwoXChromosomes X Goddamnit, I always forget to take mine! Better go do that now..   But anyway, it stresses me out too. A few months ago, two periods in a row were super light, like barely even there. I was freaking out, but the next month was back to it's pain-in-the-ass self. 
BabyBumps X Everyone is different as Mae said.  I started off smaller and was around 16 weeks when I "popped".  It was noticeable to others around week 20 and after that I just kept getting bigger and bigger.  Here is my progression taken every 5 weeks.  [progression]( ) starting at week 5.  I was 5'4"ish and started off underweight at 105 lbs and am currently at 136 lbs.  I am not athletic, I've notices some around my week and much smaller than me.  Perhaps their abs are stronger?
beyondthebump X I quit breastfeeding (at 6.5-7 months) and I'm not sure why I waited so long.  Ok, I do know: societal pressures.  I pumped for 5 months (I work 40hrs) and refused to give up, even as my supply dwindled to 9oz, 6oz during the work day (it used to be 13-15oz).  In hind-sight, I'm certain that my pride left my baby hungry.  I should have introduced formula earlier, but I was too ashamed.    Now, my baby has been weaned for 2.5 weeks and she couldn't care less.  She's gained weight and looks better than ever.  I wish I hadn't been so stubborn, my decision to wean (early) has been beneficial to both my daughter &amp;amp; me and even so, I'm guilt-ridden.    Everyone has an opinion, but that doesn't always mean that they're right.
BabyBumps X I was told mine was low lying at the 20 week scan and they said if it didn't move my dreams of a water birth were out as I'd have to have a caesarean. I have a scan on the 17th of this month for them to check the situation, so fingers crossed! I've heard that it usually moves out of the way anyway as your bump grows. Especially if it's anterior (which mine is, so I'm not too worried).
BabyBumps X Mine was low early on, but by 33 weeks an ultrasound confirmed that my uterus had grown enough that the placenta had "moved up" and off away from my cervix. If you haven't had any bleeding or pain from it by this point, chances are you'll be ok too.
BabyBumps X It sounds like your tech was impatient or just not into it. She doesn't sound too sure of herself. Does your doc have a machine in his office? Maybe talk him into doing one for you.   at my NTS (13.5 weeks) the tech started smiling and said "would you want to know if I can tell?" Hell yea. So she tells me not to go shopping yet, but it looks like a boy.   At 17 weeks I couldn't wait for my anatomy scan any longer to know for sure so I paid out of pocket for a private scan. After about a half hour she says very enthusiastically "it's a boy!"  We go for the official anatomy scan at 20 weeks, I told this tech about the 13.5wk and 17wk and she was skeptical. Turns on the machine and says "Whoa, you weren't kidding, that is a BOY". 
beyondthebump X According to my doctor, most women do not have serious side effects (ones that are inconvenient enough to want the IUD removed), but all women are different.  I did not tolerate estrogen birth control pills because I got excruciating headaches, but decided to give this a try because it's only progestin-type hormones.    I had Mirena put in after my first child was born (about 8 weeks postpartum) and had it in just over a year before I decided to get pregnant again.  I had about a month of light bleeding when it was inserted (that is normal), then never got a period again.  Other than that, I never noticed any side effects at all.  It didn't interfere with breastfeeding at all (we did 17 months).  After it was removed (which took all of 10 seconds), I waited for a month to get my period back, then got pregnant when we started trying the next month.  So in my case, it was perfect!  If you're unsure, talk to your doctor and see if you can try the mini-pill for a little while.  It has similar hormones to Mirena, and you can see how your body responds to that first.  
BabyBumps X My friend carried her baby tucked toward her back and barely showed, like you.  She did have awful back pains though!  Hopefully you don't.    You look adorable!  I'm a tiny thing and this baby is already popping like crazy, so I'm expecting another watermelon strapped to my tummy.  Sigh.
TwoXChromosomes X Don't give up hope - you are really young and science is advancing exponentially. Come to terms with the news, but realize that artificial wombs are on the drawing board and recombinant DNA technology is already so damn good that in 20 years we may be able to pull a cheek cell out of you and a partner, cross them, implant them in a dummy cell, and grow a baby outside of the body. 
AskWomen X But this kind of sexual harassment isn't prosecuted. If it was, catcalling construction workers would be getting carted off to jail in droves.  Sexual harassment from a legal standpoint usually revolves around the workplace and creating a hostile work environment. 
BabyBumps X lol yeah that is the best part of pregnancy, feeling that little bean moving around. This is my second one and I just started feeling the flutters!
beyondthebump X I had a mirena for 4 years. At first I LOVED it, no periods! But after the first year things went down hill. Every month I would get migraines from the hormones in it, on top of crazy pms symptoms. Once you take it out there is a "mirena crash" that you should look up. I am so happy I don't have it in anymore, I don't recommend it and will never use it again. Also since no periods and crazy symptoms you will always be testing to make sure you're not pregnant.   I have to edit I add that I researched this iud like crazy before getting it and read all the horrible reviews. I brushed them off and honestly regret it. 
TwoXChromosomes X I am the same way. I have never had an orgasm at the hand of anyone other than myself. Many so-called Casanovas took it very personally when they could not get me off with their tried and true methods. Admitting this early in a sexual relationship makes some lovers feel like, "Oh great here is a challenge for me to try to break down her walls. I'll get you to cum baby those other guys didn't know what they were doing." Then the same thing. No orgasm unless it is me diddling myself--minimal to no involvement from the man physically in and around my genitals. Just keep communication open. Be clear when expressing what you want and don't let it get you down. If it takes a long time to cum (this is often for me) then just enjoy the buildup and release. Don't get hung up on it because it is your body and it is functional. It just functions differently than women in the media are often portrayed.  That being said, buy a huge-ass vibrator, or anything that gets you off and enjoy!
BabyBumps X I haven't been told that he isn't growing properly at all! my due date was moved 3 days because the measurements at the first ultrasound were a little off but not much at all. i would like to have a bump that doesn't look like i haven't been to the gym in a few weeks! haha 
BabyBumps X Spotting can be totally normal at this point, so don't worry.  Cramps can also normal at this point.  You may also notice spotting (red blood) after sex or inserting anything vaginally.  Bright red spotting or bleeding that's dripping/running down your leg, or more than just dots on the toilet paper would be a reason to call your provider- or if you have this kind of spotting along with cramps.  Again, what you described sounds normal. :)
BabyBumps X I'm jealous! I'm guessing you don't get as many total strangers commenting on your belly? I get it everywhere I go - "any day now!" or "twins?!" all the damn time. I can't go anywhere without someone commenting on it or obviously staring, I don't think it would be such a problem if I wasn't carrying so large.
BabyBumps X I started off pudgy &amp; my weight gain has been minimal so far. The doc said they would be worried if baby didn't seem to be growing well. So far my little one is right on track. :)
TwoXChromosomes X It's interesting that the anti-choicers are also trying to eliminate all the options for preventing an unplanned pregnancy, too.  Why is this?  Personally, as someone who has mostly been in same-sex relationships throughout my life, I wonder if the anti-choicers are trying to push all women into lesbianism.  That's the only way to eliminate the risk of an unplanned pregnancy entirely while still having sex.  
BabyBumps X What does that mean "too close to delivery"?  You can have an epidural while you are delivering.  As a matter of fact, if they do it right, you can tell the difference between regular contractions and actual "pushing" contractions.    (Side rant: not that anyone bothered to ask me if my body was ready to push.  I just got a lot of yelling that I was at 10 cm OMG - push push - even to the point of a nurse IN MY FACE yelling about it.  I ignored everyone and faked it until my body was ready and then, when my pushing contractions started the baby came out very quickly.  I mean WTF, did they have somewhere else to be?  If so, they could have just left me alone and given me a button to press if I needed anything.  I mean seriously!)
TwoXChromosomes X Yes, all of these hypothetical blastocysts and zygotes and fetuses are considered actual real human beings for this discussion.   At what point do we say that a life can support itself? That all of the biological parts such as the nervous, cardiac, and respiratory system are fully functioning so that the human does not require outside life support? Or that it is completely independent of others to live and take care of itself?
BabyBumps X Unless the baby is in distress or something you shouldn't be pushing until your body starts the pushing contractions.  I have heard some horrible tearing stories.  When your body starts pushing it is the kind of feeling that is hard to stop. Kind of like throwing up.  You may not want to, but your body really wants to.  Maybe you can stop it for a short time, but in the end, you will do it and frankly, you feel so much better because you did.  Its a really strange sensation.  Oh, and I did my first baby with an Epidural, my second and third naturally.  My second because she came so fast and my third because the guy that came in to do the Epidural was the doctor who did my first.  It hadn't gone well, so I changed my mind and decide to brave it alone.  
TwoXChromosomes X Life is a poor choice.  It is life.  It doesn't go from nonliving to living just because of it becomes viable outside the womb or birth.  The argument is, and should be, over personhood which is apply fairly arbitrarily tbh.
TwoXChromosomes X Analogy time, since we are throwing out a lot of them.  I've used this before to explain the position of the other side, or at least what I would wager their position is.  You have a boat.  You drag someone onto your boat and then go out into the middle of the ocean.  This someone was forced onto your boat and is now reliant on you for survival and incapable of swimming to shore.  You decide you don't want this person on your boat anymore and you throw them overboard which results in them drowning.  This seems to be what a lot of the pro-life (anti-choice) have in mind when it comes to pregnancy and abortion.  You effectively drag a human life into existence and then decide to abort it afterward. You can debate whether or not it is life, I think this is a stupid debate myself.  It is life.  A zygote, an embryo, and a fetus are all human life... just human life in the early stages.  The debate is really over when we apply personhood imo.  I apologize if this is a particularly shitty place to put this comment.
TwoXChromosomes X Talk to your doc, you need to switch to a pill with a different level of hormones.  My first birth control pill experience: all was good the first month, got my period, bled for three weeks! Holy cow, that will sure prevent me from getting pregnant, but not exactly what I was going for...
BabyBumps X Are you getting the ones that feel like shudders? They are crazy... Plus I feel like this girl is kicking me on both sides of my stomach at once. Magician or lying transverse? Who knows...
BabyBumps X Thank you for the welcome and the long hug!  haha :)  I've been lurking so long, I feel like I kinda know you already!   Pregnancy has been really great mostly - had "evening sickness" rather than morning, but only got truly sick twice.  Had headaches pretty much daily from weeks 12-20, so that was pretty bad, but I'm sure it could've been worse, and they're finally gone - so now I feel great!  :)  Oh, and heartburn... but that's just kind of a given, right?
BabyBumps X Well, I looked it up because my last baby was born in 1.5 hours from when I noticed to when I delivered... I was worried, this one would be born in the car and I know that doctors like to "intervene" with this situation.  However, current research shows that doing anything during the delivery is probably the worst thing that you could do.    Here is a really good article about what is currently recommended and why.  It also describes why you don't need to worry about the cord wrapped around his neck "nuchal cord" and why your baby's risks haven't really changed.  Apparently studies find that between 10 - 40% of babies are in this situation! -clamping.com/2011/11/04/cord-around-the-neck-what-parents-practitioners-should-know/
TwoXChromosomes X Did you read the article at all?  I also spend half my life on /r/sex trying to convince men that there is nothing wrong with them even if they can't give their partner a vaginal orgasm.  Clitoral orgasms are great and no woman is broken just because she can't have a vaginal orgasm.
BabyBumps X At my first appointment, they also did a pap smear and transvaginal sonogram.  I was expecting the through the belly sonogram you see on TV, but NOPE!  If you're not familiar with them, google a picture - no need to be surprised by the wand when you get there.  You won't hear the heartbeat, but you'll probably get to see a couple of pixels flash on the screen - it's a BABY!  They sent me home with sonogram pictures that looked like a Lima bean.  Also, every time I go, I have to pee in a cup.  Getting a pregnant woman to pee usually isn't difficult, just don't go right before your appointment.  CONGRATS!
TwoXChromosomes X Placebo pills are exactly that. You only "need" to take them because it helps keep you on track to remember to take your pills. But with that said, not all pills are the same. My pill only has 2 placebo pills instead of 7. I have a low dose of hormones in 5 of the 7 during the last week. This, according to my doctor helps with things like headaches caused by the sudden drop of estrogen. 
TwoXChromosomes X I had my first Implanon about a year and a half ago. Since each lasts 3 years, I don't know what removing it is like.  I love it. I'm happy with my choice because I don't have to worry about forgetting pills. Local anesthesia is used to numb the area (though I refused to look at it while it was being inserted).  It didn't change my weight. Bonus: I rarely have a period. Maybe once every six months.
AskWomen X Orgasms are not something  men "give" women.  Women who have orgasms with other people are women who have learned to respond to physical (and mental, and emotional) stimulation that is different, that is other than what they provide for themselves.  Take PIV sex.  Many women don't have orgasms directly through PIV sex.  They can still enjoy PIV sex; can still enjoy the closeness, the sensuality, and enjoy their partner's pleasure.  There's nothing wrong with having PIV sex, and then being held afterwards by your partner, while you bring yourself to orgasm, or have them involved as much as you are comfortable with.  Perhaps achieving orgasm as a "personal challenge" isn't helpful for you right now.  Some people find that sensuality and love-making (whether PIV or not) is better for them when they set aside being goal-directed, and just enjoy what they're doing at the moment.
TwoXChromosomes X Go to an endo or a gyn, get a blood test for insulin (not sugar, insulin) and testosterone. If both of those are high you might have PCOS. It's really important that you go to a gyn because missing periods can be a product of ovarian cysts.   I wouldn't diagnose yourself without going to a doctor.  I've found that weight training (strangely enough) has helped to lower my testosterone levels.  But, seriously, go to a doctor.
TwoXChromosomes X You are/were likely still protected from pregnancy, but it's not an absolute.  When taken at the same time every day, birth control pills are over 99% effective. The reality is that many women do not take them exactly as directed. For those women, the pill is still about 95% effective, which is more effective than condoms alone.    You most likely are just fine, but there is no guarantee. If you are in a position where pregnancy would be the worst news, then you should probably get yourself Plan B to avoid that situation.
AskWomen X This is good advice.  Maybe start with saying that you're not feeling great, or you're a little sleepy so you might need some extra attention, then ask him to go down on you or use his fingers to get you off.  If it takes awhile just let him know you want to keep going but it feels like it still might take a bit.  If it works you could then build off of that by saying you liked what he did last time and will he do it again for you.  Also, relax and think sexy thoughts.  Not sure if you're into porn, but it has helped me frequently when I felt like my body might not respond.  Oh and one last thing - Do you rub yourself during sex?  I know some guys get weirded out by this but for me it's one of the easiest ways to have an orgasm.
TwoXChromosomes X I use a cup as well but somehow the idea of reusable pads still grosses me out. Edit: Maybe it's because I have a super heavy flow? not sure.
Parenting X My friend almost died during a natural birth at a birthing center. It was her second child. Her placenta didn't detach and she started hemorrhaging. She said that she would never again consider or recommend having a baby anywhere but a hospital. She'd already had one smooth natural birth so thought everything would go will...it didn't. To each their own, but IMO it's not worth the risk.
TwoXChromosomes X My story is very similar to lawdylawd's. I was on the pill for quite a long time and decided to switch to the shot in August of /10. Everything was going okay up until about December. At that point I started getting super lethargic and depressed, mixed with some other horrible emotions. It was my first year of uni and I was completely fucked. My GP told me to stop getting the shots immediately and put me on an antidepressant/anti-anxiety med and stressed that I take it for the next nine months to make sure I had no issues of quitting too early.    I also stopped getting my period while on depo, which was awesome at the time, but immediately after missing my last appointment for the shot I started bleeding. And bleeding. I KEPT bleeding for four months until my doctor decided to finally put my non-hormonal IUD in. Four months of bleeding while taking my anti-depressants every day, all because of that stupid shot.  That being said, I love love love my IUD! I can handle the slightly heavier (always on time) periods mixed with cramping in exchange for a worry- and hormone-free birth control. :)    EDIT: I apologize if there is absolutely zero flow in this post. Wrote it from my phone so I try to keep it short and sweet.
BabyBumps X Haha...the good old "I don't feel pregnant."  After my positive test, but before my first u/s, I actually got in an argument with my mom over this. I was insisting that somehow, I might not be preggo...  I've since found out that it's super normal. I'd never heard of it before, but apparently almost everyone feels that way. I still feel that way most of the time, or that I'm somehow not going to end up with a baby or something.  So when is that magical point when you feel pregnant? Seeing the baby on a u/s helps A LOT--especially hearing the heartbeat--but so far, I haven't ever felt pregnant 100% of the time. Not even 50% of the time.   I swear, I don't know how I'm avoiding drinking so well, when I don't even feel like I need to....
BabyBumps X Don't worry, you'll probably start puking soon enough :). Congratulations! I didn't really feel pregnant until like 7 or 8 weeks when I just felt sick. Ater that went away I didn't really feel pregnant at all until 15 or 16 weeks maybe.
TwoXChromosomes X Okay honestly, I'd never looked into the cup before your comment. I watched a video tutorial. Do you mind if I ask, is it messy to put in/take out? How often do you have to change it? Are they expensive compared to tampons? Is it uncomfortable?
TwoXChromosomes X It can be messy to take in and out but I've done it without getting a drop on me. It is quite different from tampons and you need to be comfortable with your own body and your own fluids.  I find it lasts twice as long as a tampon and can be left in much longer without risk of TSS.  There is a definite learning curve even though there doesn't feel like there should be.  They cost in the neighborhood of $20 on Amazon which for me is a huge savings. I was going through a 40 box of OB supers per month.  It is no more uncomfortable than tampons. Both have their pluses and minuses but the pluses for me far outweigh. I love not having to carry anything with me, that they barely leak and are a much better cork than tampons. 
TwoXChromosomes X I LOVE how you ended this.   I think it might be an age thing sometimes too. Mine were always...normal? not particularly heavy until I entered my 30's. Some time after 30 mine got CRAZY, on my heavy days the super tampons aren't even enough and I have to wear a pad as well, and still change them every hour or so.
AskWomen X It depends on the pill. Some you would be okay with missing a day, and others you aren't. I know for my own pill, if I miss a day in the third week, my (normally very regular and predictable) period will come much earlier. 
TwoXChromosomes X The cup is a one-time purchase. They're made of medical-grade silicone, so they may discolor over time, but they will last basically forever. It's a HUGE cost-savings for me, and it's a really green, less wasteful alternative to disposables (tampons or Instead cups or pads).
TwoXChromosomes X I had Implanon 2 years ago and I absolutely love it!  I haven't had any negative reactions, and my PMS has totally stopped (much to the delight of my housemates). I also only get a period once or twice a year - YAY! The removal of it is done with local anesthesic, just like putting it in, and I am fully intending to get a new one in a year when this one comes out.
BabyBumps X Ask your Dr., my midwives had a pamphlet with some local groups that do them. A few of all types. Most hospitals have the Lamaze style class, there are also bradley classes (12 wks long), and hypnobirthing classes. I know the bradley website has a page to find local teachers.   I found a local doula who teaches a 6 wk course. It was very close to bradley style but I really like her vibe, not preachy like the bradley book could be. 
TwoXChromosomes X It definitely feels like I'm evangelizing sometimes, but the cup really changed how I experience my periods. There used to be so much panic about whether I had enough tampons, what if I was traveling and ran out, etc. They aren't for everyone, but they were amazing for me.
beyondthebump X I *think* we're using the newborn nipples. I'm not sure. We were given so many bottles and nipples we don't know what to do with them. My husband switched her to a Dr. Brown bottle today and we're seeing how that goes... so far, so good, but I still worry. She *does* sound congested after she eats - I wonder why... :/  And I'm jealous your milk flow is so good! Mine is "okay" as her doctor said. She checked my breasts and showed me how to breastfeed. I've been pumping on the side and all I can get out of my breasts is about 3oz at a time, between the two. When I actually put her to my breasts (when they feel full), she can drain both and still act hungry... that's why we we had to go to formula. I felt bad. ._.'
AskWomen X ["...Only about 7% of women always have orgasms with sex alone, he says, while 27% say they never do."]( -hew-ordistance11feb11,1,608530.story?track=rss&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true)  Penetration + clitoris stimulation = orgasm for most women. Penetration alone is fun, but will not guarantee an orgasm.
BabyBumps X I am having my birth at a gorgeous freestanding birth center here in Portland. It's heavenly! I'll have a postpartum doula to help after the birth, and have been canning soups and things for baby time this month.   We get 48hrs to stay at the center, should we choose, and there are 24hr on call PP doulas there, too.   I'm pretty excited to give birth there again!!  :-) 
AskWomen X When a woman has her period, her body is shedding the lining that preps where an fertilized egg would land to gestate. When the body realizes it's not pregnant, the uterus contracts NINETY BILLION MILLION THOUSAND TIMES, to shed the lining. This contraction sheds and pushes the lining out of the body and results in cramps.
AskWomen X To answer your last 2 questions, yes it can be pretty bad. Some women are in so much pain, they need medication to go through the week otherwise they are bed ridden. The cramps can be extremely painful. On top of that, you've got a whole hormonal party and it ain't a fun one. You feel icky, bloated and very sensitive. Again, it's different for every women but those are common ones.  How do we go through it? No choice, have to. I like it remind myself by thinking "yay another month that I'm not pregnant"
CsectionCentral X Ok, just read the birth story and looked at the pics... Just wonderful. Funny, even though I know you had a VBAC, I kept thinking you would get another section! I was like... Meconium, oh no! Not progressing, oh no! Pushing for 2+ hours, oh nooo! Haha.  My question is this... Did you feel much of the pushing and crowning? I want a VBAC with the next baby, but I am terrified of labor, and wonder if an epidural would help ease my fears.   Oh and also, what was the healing/recovery like compared to the section?
Parenting X Occasionally you can find the compromise of a birthing center that is attached to a hospital. A friend of mine is doing that and it's a bit of the best of both worlds since you get the care of a birthing center but if everything goes to hell the doctors are right down the hall.
BabyBumps X If you're in the US, and you're an "employee" (you get a W-2 for taxes, not a 1099) you should be covered under the [Family and Medical Leave Act]( -pregnancy/) which gives you up to 12 weeks unpaid leave as long as you have been working at the company for a year before you take the leave - and you have to request leave at least 30 days before hand.    I'd definitely get a hold of the employee handbook, which should lay out all the rules for your company - but by law, they can't be more strict than the FMLA.  If other people have taken maternity leave recently, you may feel better if you talk to them first to see what they did and how your boss handled it.  Edit: I keep saying "company", but since you are a post doc, not a student, your University should count as a "company".
TwoXChromosomes X Ive had the mirena iud before and loved it. Periods turned into 3-4 days of spotting and only mild cramping usually while i had it. A friend of mine had a paraguard at the time and always complained about it. I hope it gets better for you!
BabyBumps X If he is looking for a due date, he needs LMP date or an ultrasound. Most PP's don't have an ultrasound machine in house. PP can confirm though.
BabyBumps X My cycles were off, so I had a decent wait. I went to the health dept to get confirmation and health insurance, then scheduled a drs appointment which was a week or two away, the doctor guessed I was about 6-7 weeks, though my lmp said I was 14 weeks because he couldn't find a heartbeat with Doppler and he was feeling for my uterus. Then I was called the next day with a date for an ultrasound about two weeks away and was told to go back to get the rest of my blood drawn, as they only took one vial the day before. When I should have been 16 weeks, I was 12 weeks, as it showed on the ultrasound.   Ultimately, you may as well wait. Waiting is something you deal with all of pregnancy, and your wait is really short, so if anything, I'd wait for the appointment and express your angst to find out how far along she is in hopes of getting things moving.
TwoXChromosomes X I was on a low-dose pill for two years (around age 25) - microgestin Fe 1/20. It worked well for me, side effects were slightly lower libido &amp; it seemed harder to lose weight, but no weight gain.  The thing about BC is, *everyone is different*. The method you were using before wasn't a good fit for you. But just because something worked for me, or even many many other folks here, that doesn't mean it will be a good match for you.  I always recommend the Planned Parenthood [BC page]( -topics/birth-control-4211.htm) for comparing methods.   But when it comes to the pill the different brands have different amounts of hormones, and what works is really individual. The best option is probably to talk to your ob/gyn (or GP in Canada &amp; some other places), lay out your concerns, and get a 3 month scrip with the understanding that you will be calling/emailing to either extend that or try a different pill. Keep in mind that it can take 2-3 months of adjustment for any hormonal method.
BabyBumps X I've been noticing mostly rib kicks for a couple of weeks now, and my mom had a feel of my bump yesterday (she's a midwife) and confirmed that he's head down, but I don't really know for sure! I guess he could still turn all over the place if he wanted, but he better not!
BabyBumps X When I found out I was pregnant I was so shocked. Not at all how I thought I would react to seeing two lines! My husband was so excited but I've stayed cautious so far. Congrats on your pregnancy!!! 
BabyBumps X Congrats! I found out 8 days early, too! Except I was TTC and just couldn't wait to test :P  My first appointment was at 7 weeks and I had my first ultrasound at 8 weeks. I also got to hear the heart beat again via Doppler last week, when I was 11 weeks on the day.  
BabyBumps X Yes I always thought it was a boy. And it was! I kept referring to the baby as a him... So my husband also thought it was a boy.
BabyBumps X  With my first pregnancy I had a dream I was having a girl, it was carved in a heart on a tree. I never doubted it either, she was always a she. When I went to find out the sex they asked if I wanted to know. I said "girl, right?" And I was haha. With this pregnancy I just knew he was a boy. My boyfriend swore I was wrong but nope, I was right again :)  
TwoXChromosomes X I went shopping at H&amp;M yesterday and bought two pairs of pants  one is a size 4 and the other is a size 8. _  I love me some H&amp;M, but c'mon!
BabyBumps X I found out at 8 weeks, and just went in for a pregnancy test.  Then my first ultrasound, and super long millions of questions and tests appointment was at 13 weeks!  Just be aware that unless you're high risk or something is wrong, there's not as many appointments and ultrasounds as you might think!  Even being high risk, I only got 3 ultrasounds in total (not counting the very last couple of appointments were they just checked the fluids real quick).
AskWomen X Seeing as you're getting a steady flow of hormones from the implant, your body doesn't really have a break to bleed like you would with the pill.   It's the same with my mirena IUD. Some women stop having their period altogether. I still get a monthly period though regardless. It all depends on your body.   Having only a couple periods a year on an implanted BC is normal. Not having a period is not harmful to you in any way.    BUT, since you don't have that monthly period to tell you that you're not pregnant, you should take a pregnancy test every month that you don't get a period to make sure. 
BabyBumps X I had some bright red spotting early on, though nothing as bad as you.  Turns out is wasn't related to the baby at all.  Just stay positive.
BabyBumps X How awesome that you're feeling like that! I'm just starting to feel like that now, like everything is amazing. I can't wait to have my baby girl in my arms, as I get her room ready, talking to hubby, cooking food, etc....everything is awesome. Its nice to finally have these sweet natural highs.
